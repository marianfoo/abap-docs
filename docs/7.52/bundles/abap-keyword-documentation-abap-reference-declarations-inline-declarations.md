Inline Declarations

An inline declaration is performed using a [declaration operator](javascript:call_link\('abendeclaration_operator_glosry.htm'\) "Glossary Entry") in a [declaration expression](javascript:call_link\('abendeclaration_expression_glosry.htm'\) "Glossary Entry") and is made in a [declaration position](javascript:call_link\('abendeclaration_position_glosry.htm'\) "Glossary Entry"). The result of the declaration is used in the current operand position, is visible statically from the current position, and is valid in the current context.

-   [Inline Declaration of Field Symbols](javascript:call_link\('abenfield-symbol_inline.htm'\))

Notes

Inline declarations are intended to make programs leaner and easier to understand. The following rules must also be observed:

-   The rule that dictates [no global variables and field symbols](javascript:call_link\('abendeclaration_variables_guidl.htm'\) "Guideline") means that inline declarations should only be used in processing blocks that support [local data](javascript:call_link\('abenlocal_data_glosry.htm'\) "Glossary Entry").

-   Inline declarations are an exception to the rule that [local declarations](javascript:call_link\('abenlocal_declar_guidl.htm'\) "Guideline") should only be made at the start of a procedure. For this reason, they should only be used in easily manageable procedures, to make them easier to understand.

Programming Guideline

[Only use inline declarations locally](javascript:call_link\('abendeclaration_inline_guidl.htm'\) "Guideline")

DATA - Inline Declaration

Syntax

... DATA(var) ...

Effect

A declaration expression with the declaration operator DATA declares a [variable](javascript:call_link\('abenvariable_glosry.htm'\) "Glossary Entry") var used as an operand in the current [writing position](javascript:call_link\('abenwriting_position_glosry.htm'\) "Glossary Entry"). The declared variable is visible statically in the program from the location DATA(var) and is valid in the current [context](javascript:call_link\('abencontext_2_glosry.htm'\) "Glossary Entry"). The declaration is made when the program is compiled, regardless of whether the statement is actually executed.

The declaration operator DATA can be specified in every compatible [declaration position](javascript:call_link\('abendeclaration_positions.htm'\)). The date type of the variable is determined by the [operand type](javascript:call_link\('abenoperand_type_glosry.htm'\) "Glossary Entry"). It must be possible to derive this type statically in full.

A variable var declared inline cannot be used in a reading position of the same statement.

Programming Guideline

[Only use inline declarations locally](javascript:call_link\('abendeclaration_inline_guidl.htm'\) "Guideline").

Notes

-   A valid statement with an inline declaration of a variable can generally be interpreted as a short form for a declaration statement used as a direct prefix.

DATA var TYPE ...
... var ...

Exceptions to this rule occur only if an identically named data object from a more global context is used in the same statement. This data object is still valid in the statement and is only obscured after the statement.

-   Just like the statement DATA, an inline declaration does not open a local context for the current statement block. An inline declaration for a variable can only be made once within a context and the variable cannot yet be declared there using DATA.

-   An inline declaration cannot occur on the right-hand side of an assignment or within an expression.

-   The operand position and the types of other operands can be included in the static derivation of the operand type. If the type of a different operand cannot be identified statically (perhaps because it is specified as a generically typed field symbol), either a suitable [standard type](javascript:call_link\('abenstandard_type_glosry.htm'\) "Glossary Entry") is used or no inline declaration is possible.

-   If the operand type is defined by reference to a data type in ABAP Dictionary, it is used together with its semantic attributes, such as field help, input help, or conversion routines.

-   If more than one equally valid operand type is possible in the same [declaration position](javascript:call_link\('abendeclaration_positions.htm'\)), the recommended preferred data type is generally used.

Example

Inline declaration of an internal table as a target field of an assignment and inline declaration of an appropriate work area in a LOOP.

TYPES t\_itab TYPE TABLE OF i
             WITH NON-UNIQUE KEY table\_line.
DATA(itab) = VALUE t\_itab( ( 1 ) ( 2 ) ( 3 ) ).
LOOP AT itab INTO DATA(wa).
  ...
ENDLOOP.

Example

Inline declaration of an internal table as a target field of a [SELECT](javascript:call_link\('abapselect.htm'\)) statement and inline declaration of a variable for the table transformed to HTML. The data type of the variable is determined by the return value of the method.

SELECT \*
       FROM scarr
       INTO TABLE @DATA(itab).
DATA(html) = cl\_demo\_output=>get( itab ).

FIELD-SYMBOL - Inline Declaration

Syntax

... FIELD-SYMBOL(<fs>) ...

Effect

A declaration expression with the declaration operator FIELD-SYMBOL declares a [field symbol](javascript:call_link\('abenfield_symbol_glosry.htm'\) "Glossary Entry") <fs> to which a memory area is assigned in the current operand position. The declared field symbol is visible statically in the program from the location FIELD-SYMBOL(<fs>) and is valid in the current [context](javascript:call_link\('abencontext_2_glosry.htm'\) "Glossary Entry"). The declaration is made when the program is compiled, regardless of whether the statement is actually executed.

The declaration operator FIELD-SYMBOL can be specified in every valid [declaration position](javascript:call_link\('abendeclaration_positions.htm'\)) (this involves assignments of the memory area only). The typing of the field symbol is determined using the statically known type of the assigned memory area. It can be generic and complete.

A field symbol <fs> declared inline cannot be used in a reading position of the same statement.

Programming Guideline

[Only use inline declarations locally](javascript:call_link\('abendeclaration_inline_guidl.htm'\) "Guideline").

Notes

-   A valid statement with an inline declaration of a field symbol can generally be interpreted as a short form for a declaration statement used as a direct prefix.

FIELD-SYMBOLS <fs> TYPE ...
... <fs> ...

Exceptions to this rule occur only if an identically named field symbol from a more global context is used in the same statement. This data object is still valid in the statement and is only obscured after the statement.

-   Just like the statement FIELD-SYMBOLS, an inline declaration does not open a local context for the current statement block. An inline declaration for a field symbol can only be made once within a context and the field symbol cannot yet be declared there using FIELD-SYMBOLS.

-   If the type of the assigned memory area is defined by reference to a data type in ABAP Dictionary, it is used together with its semantic attributes, such as field help, input help, or conversion routines.

Example

Inline declaration of a field symbol for an internal table in an ASSIGN statement and inline declaration of a field symbol for the rows of the table in a LOOP.

TYPES t\_itab TYPE TABLE OF i
             WITH NON-UNIQUE KEY table\_line.
DATA(dref) = NEW t\_itab( ( 1 ) ( 2 ) ( 3 ) ).
ASSIGN dref->\* TO FIELD-SYMBOL(<itab>).
LOOP AT <itab> ASSIGNING FIELD-SYMBOL(<line>).
  ...
ENDLOOP.
