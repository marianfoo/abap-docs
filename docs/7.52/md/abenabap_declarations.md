The statements [PARAMETERS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapparameters.htm) and [SELECT OPTIONS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options.htm) for declaring input fields in [selection screens](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_screen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") are also declarative statements, but are listed separately in the respective sections.

Note

Alongside the explicit ways of declaring data objects described here, there are also statements and additions that declare data objects implicitly, such as [SELECTION-SCREEN COMMENT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselection-screen_comment.htm). However, most of these statements are obsolete (for example [SUMMING](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapsumming.htm)).
