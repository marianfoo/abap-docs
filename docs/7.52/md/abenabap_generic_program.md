The statements

-   [READ REPORT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapread_report.htm),

for creating and editing [ABAP source ode](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenabap_source_code_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") dynamically are released for use in application programming. Some additions of the released statements and certain statements are intended for internal system use only and must not be used in application programs.

Notes

-   The statements listed here can be used in application programs in exceptional cases only. ABAP provides many other means of dynamic programming, which generally make creating source code dynamically unnecessary (see the list in [dynamic program processing](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenabap_language_dynamic.htm)).

-   If source code needs to be displayed or edited in SAP GUI interactively, the class CL\_GUI\_SOURCEEDIT can be used, which calls the ABAP Editor control.
