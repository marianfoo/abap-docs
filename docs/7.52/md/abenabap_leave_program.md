Exiting Programs

This section contains the statement [LEAVE PROGRAM](javascript:call_link\('abapleave_program.htm'\)) used for exiting programs.

Apart from LEAVE PROGRAM, the following statements are also used to exit programs that calls other programs without returning to the caller after the call:

-   [LEAVE TO TRANSACTION](javascript:call_link\('abapleave_to_transaction.htm'\))

-   [SUBMIT](javascript:call_link\('abapsubmit.htm'\)) without AND RETURN

Exiting certain processing blocks can also cause the entire program to be exited implicitly.
