Exiting Programs

This section contains the statement [LEAVE PROGRAM](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapleave_program.htm) used for exiting programs.

Apart from LEAVE PROGRAM, the following statements are also used to exit programs that calls other programs without returning to the caller after the call:

-   [LEAVE TO TRANSACTION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapleave_to_transaction.htm)

-   [SUBMIT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapsubmit.htm) without AND RETURN

Exiting certain processing blocks can also cause the entire program to be exited implicitly.
