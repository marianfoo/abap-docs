Statements in ABAP Objects

The statements in ABAP Objects can be classified as follows:

-   [Statements for defining classes and interfaces](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenoo_differences_class_lib_synt.htm)
    

The following statements are used to define classes and interfaces and their components. They can be used for both local and global classes or for interfaces.

-   [Statements for implementing methods](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenoo_differences_methods.htm)
    These statements implement the functions of classes in methods.
    

-   [Statements in class pools and interface pools](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenoo_differences_class_lib.htm)
    

Alongside the statements for defining the global class, statements for local declarations and implementations can also be used in [class pools](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenclass_pool_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). In [interface pools](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abeninterface_pool_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), only one type group can be made public alongside the definition of the global interface.

A language cleanup has been carried out in ABAP Objects. The [stricter ABAP syntax](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenoo_differences_obsolete.htm) now applies to all statements in ABAP Objects.
