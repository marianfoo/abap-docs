Application Server ABAP

Abbreviated as AS ABAP. Variant of the [Application Server](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensap_nw_app_server_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in [SAP NetWeaver](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensap_netweaver_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") for programming applications in ABAP. It is the successor of [SAP Basis](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensap_basis_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). Application Server ABAP provides the [ABAP runtime environment](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenabap_runtime_envir_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). It can be described as a client server system made up of at least three layers of software. These three software layers are the [presentation layer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenpresentation_layer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), [application layer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenapplication_layer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), and [database layer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendatabase_layer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). It also contains communication components such as the [RFC interface](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenrfc_interface_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), [Internet Communication Manager(ICM)](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abeninternet_con_man_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), and [ABAP Channels](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenabap_channel_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). AS ABAP guarantees the independence of the ABAP application programs of the hardware, the operating system, and the [database](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendatabase_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). [ABAP programs](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenabap_program_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") can be executed only in AS ABAP. Each AS ABAP has its own user management system, based on a [user master record](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenuser_master_record_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). A standalone AS ABAP without application components is the smallest possible [ABAP-based SAP system](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenabap_sap_system_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
