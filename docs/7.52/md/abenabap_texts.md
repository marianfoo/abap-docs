Text Repositories

The following types of persistent texts can be accessed in ABAP programs:

-   [Texts in text pools](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentext_pool.htm)

-   [Messages](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenabap_messages.htm)

These texts can be translated into a range of different languages. By default, a program accesses the texts in the [logon language](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenlogon_language_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Note

One further central repository for texts is Online Text Repository (OTR), which can be accessed using the transaction SOTR\_EDIT. In ABAP, OTR is important for [exception texts](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenexception_texts.htm) and is also used by other frameworks.
