AMDP - Inheritance

Both interface methods and redefined methods inherited from superclasses can become [AMDP methods](javascript:call_link\('abenamdp_methods.htm'\)) in the implementation, provided that their prerequisites are met and the class contains the appropriate tag interface. If a subclass contains a tag interface, this also applies to its subclasses. If an interface contains a tag interface, this also applies to classes that implement this interface.
