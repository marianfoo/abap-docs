Asynchronous update

[Update](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenupdate_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") during which [update function modules](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenupdate_function_module_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") are executed with high priority in the update work process and the calling program does not wait for completion. Asynchronous updates are started using [COMMIT WORK](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapcommit.htm) without the addition AND WAIT and are executed in a separate [update session](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenupdate_session_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
