Business Application Programming Interface

(Abbreviated as BAPI.) A predefined interface to data and processes in an SAP application stored in Business Object Repository with the basic functions Create Objects, Query Object Properties, and Change Object Properties. BAPIs are implemented using [function modules](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenfunction_module_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") with the naming convention BAPI\_<business\_object\_name> \_<method\_name> that can be called remotely and that cannot run a user dialog. BAPI Explorer, which lists the function modules for each application, can be accessed with the [transaction code](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentransaction_code_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") BAPI.
