ABAP CDS - General Syntax Rules

The general syntax rules for the [CDS DDL](javascript:call_link\('abencds_ddl_glosry.htm'\) "Glossary Entry") and [CDS DCL](javascript:call_link\('abencds_dcl_glosry.htm'\) "Glossary Entry") for defining [CDS objects](javascript:call_link\('abencds_object_glosry.htm'\) "Glossary Entry") in [ABAP CDS](javascript:call_link\('abenabap_cds_glosry.htm'\) "Glossary Entry") are as follows:

-   Keywords

-   Keywords must be all uppercase, all lowercase, or in lowercase with an uppercase initial letter. Other mixes of uppercase and lowercase are not allowed.

-   Names

-   Names are not case-sensitive.

-   A name can have a maximum of 30 characters.

-   A name can consist of letters, numbers, underscores (\_), and slashes (/).

-   A name must start with a letter, slash character, or underscore. Underscores are recommended as the naming convention for [associations](javascript:call_link\('abencds_f1_association.htm'\)).

-   The separator for names with multiple parts is a period (.). Names with multiple parts can be paths, columns with a prefixed data source, and structured annotations.

-   The following CDS keywords cannot be used as names: ALL, AND, AS, ASSOCIATION, AVG, CASE, CAST, CROSS, COUNT, DISTINCT, EXISTS, EXTEND, FROM, FULL, GROUP, HAVING, INNER, JOIN, KEY, LEFT, MAX, MIN, NOT, NULL, ON, OR, ORDER, RIGHT, SELECT, SUM, UNION, VIEW, WHEN, WHERE

-   Literals

-   Numeric literals must always be specified in full and a decimal point (.) used as a decimal separator if necessary.

-   Character literals are enclosed in single quotation marks (').

-   Comments

-   Two forward slashes (//) introduce a comment, which continues until the end of the line.

-   Comments within lines or that span multiple lines are enclosed by the characters /\* and \*/.

-   Separators

-   Statements can be closed using a semicolon (;). Sometimes this is mandatory.

-   Protected words

-   Certain keywords are protected and cannot be used as self-defined names. The reserved names that cannot be used are specified in the database table TRESE.

Notes

-   The closing semicolon after a statement is sometimes optional because one piece of CDS source code can currently only contain a single statement.

-   In [DDL source code](javascript:call_link\('abenddl_source_code_glosry.htm'\) "Glossary Entry") for [CDS data definitions](javascript:call_link\('abencds_data_definition_glosry.htm'\) "Glossary Entry") and [DCL source code](javascript:call_link\('abendcl_source_code_glosry.htm'\) "Glossary Entry") for [CDS roles](javascript:call_link\('abencds_role_glosry.htm'\) "Glossary Entry"), as well as two slashes, two dashes (\--) can also be used to introduce a comment. Slashes (//), however, are the recommended method. Two dashes are not allowed in [DDLA source code](javascript:call_link\('abenddla_source_code_glosry.htm'\) "Glossary Entry") for [annotation definitions](javascript:call_link\('abencds_anno_definition_glosry.htm'\) "Glossary Entry") and in [DDLX source code](javascript:call_link\('abenddlx_source_code_glosry.htm'\) "Glossary Entry") for [metadata extensions](javascript:call_link\('abencds_metadata_extension_glosry.htm'\) "Glossary Entry").

Examples

-   SELECT, select, and Select are all valid ways of specifying a keyword. seLect and SeLect, on the other hand, produce syntax errors.

-   MYVIEW, myview, and myView all identify the same operand.

-   0.5 is a valid numeric literal, but .5 is not.
