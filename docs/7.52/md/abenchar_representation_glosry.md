Character Representation

Binary coding of characters. To assign a [character set](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencharacter_set_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") to a character representation, you use [codepages](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencodepage_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The [ISO-8859](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abeniso-8859_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") codepages are [single-byte](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensingle_byte_code_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") character representations, in which every character is encoded in up to one byte. SJIS and BIG5 are [double-byte](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendouble_byte_code_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") character representations for Japanese and traditional Chinese fonts. The [Unicode character representations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenunicode_char_represent_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") enclose all characters world-wide and can be encoded by one, two, or four bytes, depending on the [UTF](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenutf_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") representation.
