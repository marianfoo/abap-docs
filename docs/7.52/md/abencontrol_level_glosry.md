group level

Contiguous group of rows in an [internal table](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abeninternal_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or an [extract](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenextract_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that have the same content in an initial part of the rows. Group levels are produced by the order of the rows in the internal table or extract. The transition from one group level to the next is called a [group break](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencontrol_break_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). Group levels can be enabled by [group level processing](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencontrol_level_processin_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
