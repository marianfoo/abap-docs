conversion routine

Also known as conversion exit. A conversion routine consists of two [function modules](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenfunction_module_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") with the naming convention CONVERSION\_EXIT\_.....\_INPUT*|*OUTPUT and can be assigned directly to a [dynpro field](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendynpro_field_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or a [domain](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendomain_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). When input and output is produced in these dynpro fields or when the statements [WRITE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapwrite-.htm) and [WRITE TO](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapwrite_to.htm) are used, the function modules perform the conversions implemented there.
