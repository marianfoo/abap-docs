customer exit

Option provided by SAP for the enhancement of delivered standard programs without modifying the original program in the customer system. For potential customer requirements that are not part of the standard, SAP installs blank containers, which customers can fill with their own functions. Customer exits are administered by SAP in [transaction](javascript:call_link\('abentransaction_glosry.htm'\) "Glossary Entry") SMOD. In transaction CMOD, customers select the enhancement that they want to edit, group them together as enhancement projects, edit the components, and activate the relevant projects. Customer exits are obsolete and have been replaced by [BAdIs](javascript:call_link\('abenbadi_glosry.htm'\) "Glossary Entry") and other [enhancement points](javascript:call_link\('abenenhancement_point_glosry.htm'\) "Glossary Entry").
