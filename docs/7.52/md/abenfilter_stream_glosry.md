filter stream

[Stream](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenstream_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that is not connected directly to a [data source](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendata_source_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or a [data sink](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendata_sink_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") but to another stream instead. A filter stream is either a [reader stream](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenreader_stream_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), which reads and filters the data of another reader stream, or it is a [writer stream](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenwriter_stream_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") which writes filtered data to another writer stream.
