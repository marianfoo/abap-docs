Internet Communication Manager

Abbreviated as ICM. Internet Communication Manager is a process of [AS ABAP](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensap_nw_abap_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that enables AS ABAP to communicate directly with the Internet using HTTP/HTTPS/SMTP. ICM is used to connect Web-based presentation components such as [SAPUI5](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensapui5_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), [Web Dynpro ABAP](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenweb_dynpro_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), and [BSP](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenbsp_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). ICM also enables an AS ABAP to be used both as a client and as a server for Web services. ABAP programs access ICM using classes and interfaces of [Internet Communication Framework](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abeninternet_con_fra_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
