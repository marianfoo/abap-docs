Internet Transaction Server

Abbreviated as ITS. [Interface](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abeninterface_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") between an [AS ABAP](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensap_nw_abap_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and the Internet. Internet Transaction Server is based on the data interface between [ABAP programs](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenabap_program_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and [dynpros](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendynpro_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). It enables [users](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenuser_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") to communicate with AS ABAP directly from the Internet by converting the [screens](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenscreen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of dynpros to HTML files, thus enabling them to be edited in a Web browser. ITS can be installed alongside AS ABAP. [Internet Communication Manager](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abeninternet_con_man_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") (ICM) provides AS ABAP with an interface to the Internet that is integrated directly as a process, replacing ITS.
