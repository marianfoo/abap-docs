Besides the [named data objects](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abennamed_data_object_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") which can be addressed by their names in the ABAP program (this includes the text symbols) and the [anonymous data objects](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenanonymous_data_object_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") created by the statement [CREATE DATA](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapcreate_data.htm), there are literals which are defined in the source code of a program by specifying a string representing a value. Possible literals are:

-   [Numeric literals](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenuntyped_number_literals.htm)

-   [Character literals](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenuntyped_character_literals.htm)

The [literal operator](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenliteral_operator.htm) & can be used to associated multiple literals of the same type with each other.
