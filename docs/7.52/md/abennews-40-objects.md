Introducing ABAP Objects for Release 4.5

Ausblick

Overview

Release 4.5A provides the kernel functionality of ABAP objects. The following enhancements are planned for the coming functional releases: simple inheritance for classes, composition of interfaces, dynamic invocation interfaces, persistent objects, GUI integration, virtual attributes, friends, final classes and methods, embedded objects.

ABAP objects will first be used productively in pilot projects, which will probably result in small changes to the language. Activities that prepare the introduction of ABAP objects in the application will be performed in parallel. Basic questions about object-oriented programming in ABAP in the SAP System should be solved centrally.
