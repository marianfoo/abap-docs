Integrating JavaScript in Release 6.10

In Release 6.10, you can call Java Scripts from an ABAP-Programm, which allows debugging in the source text of JavaScripts. Integration also makes it possible to access ABAP Objects and ABAP data objects from JavaScript. You can also call instance methods of ABAP Objects from JavaScript.

Note

Support for the connection of JavaScript to ABAP will be discontinued without replacement in a Release after 7.02.
