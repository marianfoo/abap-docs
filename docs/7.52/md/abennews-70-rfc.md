New transactional RFC

A new interface has been developed for [tRFC](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentrfc_2_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and [qRFC](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenqrfc_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), which will exist in parallel with the old interface as of Release 7.0.
