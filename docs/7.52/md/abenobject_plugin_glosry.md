Object plug-ins are used to make modification-free functional [enhancements](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenenhancement_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") to ABAP programs. They are instances of [BAdI implementation classes](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenbadi_implement_class_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and are managed by [BAdI objects](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenbadi_object_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). Object plug-ins are created when the [GET BADI](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapget_badi.htm) statement is executed and in accordance with the specified filters.
