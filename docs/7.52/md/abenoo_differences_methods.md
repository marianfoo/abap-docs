Statements for Implementing Methods

The functions of classes are implemented in methods, between METHOD - ENDMETHOD.

The statements allowed in methods include all parts of the ABAP language allowed in any procedure. It must be noted, however, that all statements in methods are subject to the [stricter syntax](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenoo_differences_obsolete.htm) of ABAP Objects.
