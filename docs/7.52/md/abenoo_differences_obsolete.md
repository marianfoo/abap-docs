Replacements for Obsolete Language Constructs in ABAP Objects

The ABAP language has been cleaned up in ABAP Objects. As part of this language cleanup, stricter syntax checks are performed for constructs that were previously allowed, or obsolete statements are no longer allowed at all. The stricter syntax checks usually produce syntax that is also recommended for use outside of ABAP Objects but where the old versions cannot be forbidden for compatibility reasons.

The syntax revisions are listed in detail in the documentation of the language elements and also in the list of [obsolete language elements](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenabap_obsolete.htm).

The syntax revisions apply to all [statements in ABAP Objects](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenabap_objects_differences.htm).
