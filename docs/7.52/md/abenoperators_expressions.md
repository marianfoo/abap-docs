Operators and Expressions

Normally an operater links two operands with an [expression](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenexpressions.htm) or forms an expression with an operand. During the execution of a statement containing such expressions, the result of the expression is determined (operation) and used in the statement. Operators are represented either by special characters or [reserved indicators](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenabap_words.htm).
