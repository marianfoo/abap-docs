Programm Type and Program Properties

As soon as you create an ABAP program you make an important decision about its robustness and maintainability by selecting its program type and attributes. Among other things, the program type and program attributes determine how strict the syntax check is. Another important property of a program (as well as all other development objects) is its original language.
