regular expression

A pattern of literal characters and [special characters](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenregex_syntax_specials.htm) that describes a set of character strings. The use of regular expressions in text searches locates one or more occurrences of the character strings represented by the expression. A search using a regular expression is more powerful than a search for a simple character string, since the regular expression represents a greater (potentially infinite) number of character strings and searches for them in parallel. In ABAP, regular expressions can be used in the statements [FIND](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapfind_pattern.htm) and [REPLACE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapreplace_in_pattern.htm), as arguments in certain [predefined functions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenpredefined_function_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), and in the classes CL\_ABAP\_REGEX and CL\_ABAP\_MATCHER.
