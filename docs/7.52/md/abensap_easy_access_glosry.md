SAP Easy Access

Initial program that is called after a dialog logon to [AS ABAP](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensap_nw_abap_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). SAP Easy Access displays an initial menu for the access of a dialog user to AS ABAP. By default, this menu is either the SAP menu or a user menu. The SAP menu is an [area menu](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenarea_menu_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") which is centrally defined or overridden by an entry in the [user master record](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenuser_master_record_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). A user menu contains all the functions required by a dialog user and is created and assigned by the system administrator using the role maintenance (transaction PFCG). Each user can also define their favorites menu in SAP Easy Access that is displayed together with or instead of the default menu.
