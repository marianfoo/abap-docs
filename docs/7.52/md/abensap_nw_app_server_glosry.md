Abbreviated as AS. Part of [SAP NetWeaver](javascript:call_link\('abensap_netweaver_glosry.htm'\) "Glossary Entry") used to execute SAP applications. The Application Server supports Internet protocols (HTTP/HTTPS/SMTP, WebSocket protocol, and TCP) as well as [XML](javascript:call_link\('abenxml_glosry.htm'\) "Glossary Entry"), making it possible to execute Web services and other Web applications. Open development environments are available for programming applications. The functions of the previous [SAP Basis](javascript:call_link\('abensap_basis_glosry.htm'\) "Glossary Entry") for all existing SAP applications are integrated. The Application Server has the parts [Application Server ABAP](javascript:call_link\('abenabap_personality_glosry.htm'\) "Glossary Entry") and [Application Server Java](javascript:call_link\('abenjava_personality_glosry.htm'\) "Glossary Entry"). Both variants can access a persistence layer that is independent of the operating system and database system and are associated by being able to call one another.
