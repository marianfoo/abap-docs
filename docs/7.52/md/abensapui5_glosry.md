SAPUI5

SAPUI5 is a tool set for developing user interfaces for Web applications in HTML5. SAPUI5 supports the Model View Controller (MVC) approach and based on the user interface elements delivered in JavaScript and CSS libraries. The data connection to the application server is established via the data formats [XML](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenxml_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), [JSON](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenjson_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or OData. User interfaces developed with SAPUI5 can be connected to SAP and non-SAP platforms. In particular, SAPUI5 user interfaces can be developed for ABAP applications of [AS ABAP](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensap_nw_abap_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The connection is established via [ICF](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenicf_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and [APC](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenapc_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
