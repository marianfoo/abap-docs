self reference

[Object reference variable](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenobject_refer_variable_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") called [me](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenme.htm) that is predefined as a local [constant](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenconstant_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and is available in every [instance method](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abeninstance_method_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). It always points to the [instance](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abeninstance_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in which the method is currently being executed. The static type of me is the [class](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenclass_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in which the instance method is implemented.
