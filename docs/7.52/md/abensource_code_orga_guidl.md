Source Code Organization

ABAP source code is saved in the ABAP Repository in the [standard database](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenstandard_db_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of an AS ABAP, and not in source code files like in most other programming environments. Source codes can be split into individual units by using include programs. There are also [macros](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenmacros_guidl.htm "Guideline") that are handled for callable modularization units in the context of these guidelines.
