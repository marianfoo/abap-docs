test include

Special include program used to list the [test classes](javascript:call_link\('abentest_class_glosry.htm'\) "Glossary Entry") of an [ABAP program](javascript:call_link\('abenabap_program_glosry.htm'\) "Glossary Entry"). With the exception of test includes for [class pools](javascript:call_link\('abenclass_pool_glosry.htm'\) "Glossary Entry") and [function groups](javascript:call_link\('abenfunction_group_glosry.htm'\) "Glossary Entry"), no test includes can currently be created. The associated [ABAP Workbench](javascript:call_link\('abenabap_workbench_glosry.htm'\) "Glossary Entry") tools or [ABAP Development Tools (ADT)](javascript:call_link\('abenadt_glosry.htm'\) "Glossary Entry") access the associated test include automatically. The name of the test include of a class pool ends in "CCAU" and the name of the test include of a function group ends in "T99". For other programs, the naming convention of the test include is the name of the program padded with "=" up to and including the 34th position and ending in "T".
