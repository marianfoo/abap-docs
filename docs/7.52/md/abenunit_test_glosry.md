unit test

A unit test is created and conducted by developers to verify the functional correctness of individual software modules. A software module in this context is a significant unit of code that has a specific verifiable aim. [Procedures](javascript:call_link\('abenprocedure_glosry.htm'\) "Glossary Entry") are a typical example of this kind of unit in ABAP. Procedures are the smallest functional components of larger units such as [classes](javascript:call_link\('abenclass_glosry.htm'\) "Glossary Entry") or [function groups](javascript:call_link\('abenfunction_group_glosry.htm'\) "Glossary Entry"). Unit tests are used during the development and quality assurance phases to ensure that the individual components of a larger software unit function correctly. Unit tests are developed and run in [ABAP Unit](javascript:call_link\('abenabap_unit_glosry.htm'\) "Glossary Entry").
