user session

State that exists between a [user](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenuser_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [logging on](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenlogon_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") to [AS ABAP](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensap_nw_abap_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and logging off again. During the user session, the user can work with AS ABAP. A user session is characterized by a [user name](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenuser_name_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), a [client iD](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenclient_identifier_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), and the [logon language](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenlogon_language_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). Various types of user sessions exist to suit different purposes and these types are opened in different ways- Each user session is associated with between one and 16 [ABAP sessions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenmain_session_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The [user memory](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenuser_memory_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is assigned to a user session as a dedicated memory area.
