weak reference

Reference to an [object](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenobject_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of a [class](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenclass_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that is ignored when [Garbage Collector](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abengarbage_collector_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") runs, unlike [object references](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenobject_reference_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in [reference variables](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenreference_variable_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). An object that is only pointed to by weak references is deleted by Garbage Collector. Weak references are represented by objects of the class [CL\_ABAP\_WEAK\_REFERENCE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencl_abap_weak_reference.htm). See also [soft reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensoft_reference_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
