Web Dynpro

Technology used to create platform-independent Web-based interfaces, based on the Model View Controller (MVC) approach. The technology is available on both [Application Server Java](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenjava_personality_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and [Application Server ABAP](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenabap_personality_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). Before [SAPUI5](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensapui5_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") was introduced, Web Dynpro for ABAP was SAP's standard UI technology for developing Web applications in the ABAP environment. Web Dynpros for ABAP are created in [Web Dynpro Explorer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenweb_dynpro_explorer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
