Addition:

[... @parameter\_annot ... @<parameter\_annot](#!ABAP_ONE_ADD@1@)

Effect

Defines an input parameter with the name pname in the [parameter list](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencds_f1_parameter_list.htm) of a [CDS view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencds_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or the [parameter list](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencds_f1_func_parameter_list.htm) of a [CDS table function](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencds_table_function_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

The name pname must comply with the naming rules for [names](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencds_general_syntax_rules.htm). Furthermore, pname cannot contain any slash (/) characters and cannot be a reserved name in ABAP Dictionary. Also, the reserved name connection cannot be used in table functions. The reserved names that cannot be used are specified in the database table TRESE. They are not case-sensitive. The blanks in the comma-separated list are ignored and can be omitted. Each input parameter must be typed with an elementary data type [typing](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencds_typing.htm).

A CDS entity can be used with input parameters as one of the following:

-   A [data source](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencds_f1_data_source.htm) or in a [path expression](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencds_f1_path_expression.htm) of a different CDS view

-   A [data source](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect_data_source.htm) of a [SELECT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect.htm) statement from Open SQL in ABAP

In these cases, each input parameter must be assigned a suitable actual parameter whose value is then used in the operand positions in which the parameter is specified. The actual parameters are assigned using a parenthesized comma-separated list as follows:

[... cds\_entity( pname1 : act1, pname2 : act2, ...) ...](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencds_f1_select_parameters.htm),

This list must be specified directly after the name of the view when using a view with parameters (both within the CDS DDL in ABAP CDS and in Open SQL). In Open SQL , an equals sign (\=) is used instead of a colon (:).

Note

It is not currently possible to define optional input parameters or replacement parameters for input parameters. The annotation [@Environment.systemField](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencds_f1_parameter_annotations.htm) can be used, however, to make Open SQL pass ABAP system fields to an input parameter implicitly.

Addition

... @parameter\_annot ... @<parameter\_annot

Effect

Specifies annotations for the parameter. The annotations can be specified before the parameter using [@parameter\_annot](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencds_f1_parameter_annotations.htm) or after the parameter using [@parameter\_annot](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencds_f1_parameter_annotations.htm).

ABAP CDS - parameter\_annot

Syntax

... @[annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencds_annotations_syntax.htm) ...
... @<[annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencds_annotations_syntax.htm) ...

Effect

Specifies an [annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencds_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencds_annotations_syntax.htm) in the definition of an input parameter [parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencds_f1_param.htm) of a [CDS view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencds_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or a [CDS table function](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencds_table_function_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") as a parameter name. Parameter annotations can be specified before and after the parameter: The annotation should be defined as a CDS object in a [CDS annotation definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencds_anno_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and the annotation definition annotation, [@Scope](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencds_f1_define_anno_annos.htm), should be specified here using the value #PARAMETER.

-   In front of the parameter, the character @ must be placed before the name annotation of the annotation.

-   Following the parameter, the characters @< must be placed before the name annotation of the annotation.

The following tables show the possible [ABAP annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencore_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that can be specified and their meanings. The ABAP annotations are evaluated by the ABAP runtime environment for every CDS entity. Annotations with other identifiers are usually [framework-specific annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencds_annotations_frmwrk.htm). These are not evaluated by the ABAP runtime environment but by other SAP frameworks instead.

-   [EndUserText Annotations](#abencds-f1-parameter-annotations-1--------environment-annotations---@ITOC@@ABENCDS_F1_PARAMETER_ANNOTATIONS_2)

The first column displays the (possibly structured) name annotation of an ABAP annotation and the second column displays its meaning. The third column shows the possible [annotation values](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenannotation_value_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The fourth column shows the value set implicitly for the annotation value if the annotation is not used explicitly. The fifth column displays the default value set implicitly for value in accordance with the [annotation definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencds_anno_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") if the annotation is specified without a value. If nothing is specified for the annotation value, the annotation should be specified without a value.

EndUserText Annotations

Note

ABAP annotations introduced using EndUserText are used to define translatable semantic texts for a [CDS object](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencds_object_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The value of an annotation like this is saved in special tables that have a language key and that are translatable. The value specified in the source code should consist of text in the original language of the CDS source code and is translated into the required languages. The methods of the class CL\_DD\_DDL\_ANNOTATION\_SERVICE read these texts as specified by an input parameter for the language. If no language is passed to the input parameter, the [text environment language](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentext_env_langu_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is used as the default. If no text is found for the language, the [secondary language](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensecondary_language_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in AS ABAP is used.

Environment.systemField

Assigns an [ABAP system field](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensystem_field_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") to the input parameter for implicit parameter passing in Open SQL.

#CLIENT:
[sy-mandt](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensystem_fields.htm)
#SYSTEM\_DATE:
[sy-datum](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensystem_fields.htm)
#SYSTEM\_TIME:
[sy-uzeit](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensystem_fields.htm)
#SYSTEM\_LANGUAGE:

#USER:

An input parameter can be annotated strictly once with the annotation Environment.systemField. If the CDS entity is used as a [data source](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect_data_source.htm) of a [SELECT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect.htm) statement in [Open SQL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenopen_sql_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), this assignment has the following consequences:

-   No explicit actual parameter can be assigned to an input parameter to which the system field sy-mandt was assigned using #CLIENT. Open SQL always passes (implicitly) the ID of the current [client](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenclient_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in accordance with the nominal value of sy-mandt or from the clients specified using [USING CLIENT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect_client.htm). The addition [CLIENT SPECIFIED](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect_client.htm) cannot be specified when a CDS entity of this type is accessed.

-   An explicit actual parameter does not need to be assigned to an input parameter to which a system field other than sy-mandt is assigned using #SYSTEM\_.... If no explicit actual parameter is specified, Open SQL passes the nominal value of the assigned system field implicitly.

Any other values for value are ignored using an exception. Instead of the value #USER, the value #APPLICATION\_USER can be specified too. This is, however, only offered for reasons of downward compatibility.

Notes

-   The annotation @Environment.systemField is ignored in parameter passing to the CDS entity in other CDS entities. Explicit actual parameters must be specified here, for example input parameters from the current entity or even [session variables](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencds_f1_session_variable.htm).

-   The value #CLIENT of the annotation @Environment.systemField is particularly significant for [client-specific CDS table functions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencds_func_client_handling.htm). If an input parameter is annotated accordingly, it is given the current client ID implicitly by the Open SQL statement [SELECT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect.htm) and can be used to restrict the results set in the platform-dependent implementation of the function. @Environment.systemField: #CLIENT cannot be specified in the case of [cross-client CDS table functions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencds_func_client_handling.htm).

Example

The following CDS view associates all input parameters with ABAP system fields and the SELECT list consists only of the input parameters. The ABAP program DEMO\_CDS\_SYSTEM\_FIELDS accesses the CDS view by specifying parameters in full implicitly and explicitly and produces both results.

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_SYST'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
define view demo\_cds\_system\_fields
with parameters
@Environment.systemField : #CLIENT
p\_mandt : syst\_mandt,
@Environment.systemField : #SYSTEM\_DATE
p\_datum : syst\_datum,
@Environment.systemField : #SYSTEM\_TIME
p\_uzeit : syst\_uzeit,
p\_langu : syst\_langu @<Environment.systemField : #SYSTEM\_LANGUAGE,
p\_uname : syst\_uname @<Environment.systemField : #USER
as select from
demo\_expressions
{
:p\_mandt as client,
:p\_datum as datum,
:p\_uzeit as uzeit,
:p\_langu as langu,
:p\_uname as uname
}
where

... @[annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencds_annotations_syntax.htm) ...
... @<[annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencds_annotations_syntax.htm) ...

Effect

Specifies an [annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencds_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencds_annotations_syntax.htm) in the definition of an input parameter [parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencds_f1_param.htm) of a [CDS view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencds_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or a [CDS table function](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencds_table_function_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") as a parameter name. Parameter annotations can be specified before and after the parameter: The annotation should be defined as a CDS object in a [CDS annotation definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencds_anno_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and the annotation definition annotation, [@Scope](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencds_f1_define_anno_annos.htm), should be specified here using the value #PARAMETER.

-   In front of the parameter, the character @ must be placed before the name annotation of the annotation.

-   Following the parameter, the characters @< must be placed before the name annotation of the annotation.

The following tables show the possible [ABAP annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencore_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that can be specified and their meanings. The ABAP annotations are evaluated by the ABAP runtime environment for every CDS entity. Annotations with other identifiers are usually [framework-specific annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencds_annotations_frmwrk.htm). These are not evaluated by the ABAP runtime environment but by other SAP frameworks instead.

-   [EndUserText Annotations](#abencds-f1-parameter-annotations-1--------environment-annotations---@ITOC@@ABENCDS_F1_PARAMETER_ANNOTATIONS_2)

The first column displays the (possibly structured) name annotation of an ABAP annotation and the second column displays its meaning. The third column shows the possible [annotation values](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenannotation_value_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The fourth column shows the value set implicitly for the annotation value if the annotation is not used explicitly. The fifth column displays the default value set implicitly for value in accordance with the [annotation definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencds_anno_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") if the annotation is specified without a value. If nothing is specified for the annotation value, the annotation should be specified without a value.

Note

ABAP annotations introduced using EndUserText are used to define translatable semantic texts for a [CDS object](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencds_object_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The value of an annotation like this is saved in special tables that have a language key and that are translatable. The value specified in the source code should consist of text in the original language of the CDS source code and is translated into the required languages. The methods of the class CL\_DD\_DDL\_ANNOTATION\_SERVICE read these texts as specified by an input parameter for the language. If no language is passed to the input parameter, the [text environment language](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentext_env_langu_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is used as the default. If no text is found for the language, the [secondary language](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensecondary_language_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in AS ABAP is used.

Environment Annotations

Environment.systemField

Assigns an [ABAP system field](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensystem_field_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") to the input parameter for implicit parameter passing in Open SQL.

#CLIENT:
[sy-mandt](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensystem_fields.htm)
#SYSTEM\_DATE:
[sy-datum](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensystem_fields.htm)
#SYSTEM\_TIME:
[sy-uzeit](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensystem_fields.htm)
#SYSTEM\_LANGUAGE:

An input parameter can be annotated strictly once with the annotation Environment.systemField. If the CDS entity is used as a [data source](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect_data_source.htm) of a [SELECT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect.htm) statement in [Open SQL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenopen_sql_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), this assignment has the following consequences:

-   No explicit actual parameter can be assigned to an input parameter to which the system field sy-mandt was assigned using #CLIENT. Open SQL always passes (implicitly) the ID of the current [client](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenclient_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in accordance with the nominal value of sy-mandt or from the clients specified using [USING CLIENT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect_client.htm). The addition [CLIENT SPECIFIED](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect_client.htm) cannot be specified when a CDS entity of this type is accessed.

-   An explicit actual parameter does not need to be assigned to an input parameter to which a system field other than sy-mandt is assigned using #SYSTEM\_.... If no explicit actual parameter is specified, Open SQL passes the nominal value of the assigned system field implicitly.

Any other values for value are ignored using an exception. Instead of the value #USER, the value #APPLICATION\_USER can be specified too. This is, however, only offered for reasons of downward compatibility.

Notes

-   The annotation @Environment.systemField is ignored in parameter passing to the CDS entity in other CDS entities. Explicit actual parameters must be specified here, for example input parameters from the current entity or even [session variables](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencds_f1_session_variable.htm).

-   The value #CLIENT of the annotation @Environment.systemField is particularly significant for [client-specific CDS table functions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencds_func_client_handling.htm). If an input parameter is annotated accordingly, it is given the current client ID implicitly by the Open SQL statement [SELECT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect.htm) and can be used to restrict the results set in the platform-dependent implementation of the function. @Environment.systemField: #CLIENT cannot be specified in the case of [cross-client CDS table functions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencds_func_client_handling.htm).

Example

The following CDS view associates all input parameters with ABAP system fields and the SELECT list consists only of the input parameters. The ABAP program DEMO\_CDS\_SYSTEM\_FIELDS accesses the CDS view by specifying parameters in full implicitly and explicitly and produces both results.

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_SYST'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
define view demo\_cds\_system\_fields
with parameters
@Environment.systemField : #CLIENT
p\_mandt : syst\_mandt,
@Environment.systemField : #SYSTEM\_DATE
p\_datum : syst\_datum,
@Environment.systemField : #SYSTEM\_TIME
p\_uzeit : syst\_uzeit,
p\_langu : syst\_langu @<Environment.systemField : #SYSTEM\_LANGUAGE,

Note

The SQL functions [DIV](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensql_functions_numeric.htm) and [MOD](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensql_functions_numeric.htm) behave differently with respect to the signs than the ABAP operators [DIV](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenarith_operators.htm) and [MOD](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenarith_operators.htm). In the SQL function DIV, the amounts of the arguments are divided and then the sign is assigned (positive if the arguments have the same signs and negative if they have different signs). Accordingly, the result of MOD can be negative, so that multiplying the result of DIV by expr2 plus the result of MOD produces the value of expr1. The ABAP operator [MOD](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenarith_operators.htm), on the other hand, only produces positive results.

Example

The following table shows the results of integer divisions and their integer remainders in SQL. See also the example for the ABAP operators [DIV](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenarith_operators.htm) and [MOD](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenarith_operators.htm).

SQL Function UPPER

This example demonstrates the SQL function UPPER in Open SQL and ABAP CDS.

Source Code

REPORT demo\_sql\_upper.
CLASS demo DEFINITION.
  PUBLIC SECTION.
    CLASS-METHODS main.
ENDCLASS.
CLASS demo IMPLEMENTATION.
  METHOD main.

           ORDER BY arbgb, msgnr, text
           INTO TABLE @DATA(result1)
           UP TO @rows ROWS.
    "UPPER in Open SQL
    SELECT arbgb, msgnr, text
           FROM t100
           WHERE sprsl = 'E' AND

    cl\_demo\_output=>display( result1 ).  ENDMETHOD.
ENDCLASS.
START-OF-SELECTION.
  demo=>main( ).

Description

A SELECT statement accesses the following CDS view, which uses the SQL function UPPER:

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMOCDSUPPER'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
define view Demo\_Cds\_Upper
  as select from
    t100
    {
      sprsl,
      arbgb,
      msgnr,
      text,
      upper(text) as upper\_text
    }                                                                                                                                

Another SELECT statement uses the SQL function UPPER directly to access the same data source T100.

Since SQL functions cannot yet be used on the left side of LIKE in the DDL of the ABAP CDS, the view returns a help field, which is evaluated in Open SQL. The results are the same. The search effected by the examples is not case-sensitive.

IMPORT DYNPRO

This statement is for internal use only.
It must not be used in application programs.

Syntax

IMPORT DYNPRO h f e m ID id.

Effect

The [dynpro](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendynpro_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") specified in the structure id is imported. To enable this, the structure id must contain two components for the name of the program and the ID of the dynpro in the following order:

-   A component of type PROGNAME
    
-   A component of type SYDYNNR.
    

The dynpro information is loaded into the structure h (dynpro header, structure D020S) and into the internal tables f (field list, structure D021S), e (flow logic, structure D022S), and m (matchcode information, structure D023S). f, e, and m, can be specified as standard tables without secondary keys.

Note

As an alternative to a structure, a character-like field (including string) can be specified for id, where the field contains the chained contents of the structure components (including trailing blanks).

System Fields

SYNTAX-CHECK FOR DYNPRO

This statement is for internal use only.
It must not be used in application programs.

Syntax

SYNTAX-CHECK FOR DYNPRO h f e m ...MESSAGE f1 ...LINE f2
                                ...WORD f3.

Parts marked with " ..." are interchangeable

Extras:

[1\. ... OFFSET f4](#!ABAP_ADDITION_1@1@)
[2\. ... TRACE-TABLE itab1](#!ABAP_ADDITION_2@2@)
[3\. ... MESSAGE-ID f5](#!ABAP_ADDITION_3@3@)

Effect

Syntax check for dynpro
The [dynpro](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendynpro_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") description is taken from the field string h and the internal tables f, e, and m. The field string h (dynpro header) should correspond to the structure D020S, the internal table f (field list) to the structure D021S, the internal table e (flow logic) to the structure D022S, and the internal table m (matchcode information) to the structure D023S. Standard tables without secondary keys can be specified for f, e, and m.

Example

DATA: DHEAD    TYPE D020S,                   "dynpro header
      DFIELDS  TYPE TABLE OF D021S,          "field list
      DFLOWL   TYPE TABLE OF D022S,          "flow logic
      MCINFO   TYPE TABLE OF D023S.          "matchcode information

If a syntax error is detected during the check, the fields f1, f2, and f3 are filled as follows:

\- f1 contains the error message text.
\- f2 contains the dynpro line where the error occurred
\- f3 contains the word with the error in the dynpro

System Fields

sy-subrc

Meaning

0

The dynpro does not have any syntax errors.

4

The dynpro has syntax errors.

Addition 1

... OFFSET f4

Effect

When a syntax error occurs, the position of the word with the error in the line with the error is stored in this field.

Addition 2

... TRACE-TABLE itab1

Effect

Any trace output is stored in this table. Trace output is switched on automatically when this addition is specified. A standard table without secondary keys can be specified for itab1.

Addition 3

... MESSAGE-ID f5

Effect

If a syntax error occurs, the key of the corresponding error message is returned in field f5. This key has the same layout as the key of table TRMSG.

[ABAP - Keyword Documentation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenabap.htm) →  [ABAP - Reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenabap_reference.htm) →  [SAP GUI User Dialogs](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenabap_screens.htm) →  [Dynpros](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenabap_dynpros.htm) → 

Dynpro Fields

The [dynpro flow logic](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendynpro_flow_logic_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") does not contain any data declarations. With the exception of the [OK field](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenok_field_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") created when the [dynpro](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendynpro_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") itself is created, all other data objects of a dynpro (dynpro fields) created when the screen elements are defined in Layout Editor are assigned to the latter. The technical attributes length and data type of a dynpro field are determined by the element attributes defLg and Format. The data types of dynpro fields are determined either by reference to [built-in data types](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenddic_builtin_types.htm) from ABAP Dictionary (except CLNT and FLTP) or by reference to global fields of the ABAP program. In Layout Editor, it is possible to apply fields from ABAP Dictionary or the ABAP program, in which case name, length and data type of the dynpro fields are automatically defined in a matching way. All elementary data types except [enumerated types](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenenumerated_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") are possible.

After [PBO](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenpbo_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and before the [screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenscreen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is sent, there is a data transport of global data objects for the respective ABAP program to dynpro fields of the same name. After a user action on the screen, and before or during [PAI](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenpai_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") editing, the data transport takes place in the reverse order.

At PBO time, all dynpro fields are transported at the end of PBO processing, with the exception of fields that are defined in table controls or in [step loops](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenstep_loop_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The latter are processed in loops in the flow logic and transported from the ABAP program to the dynpro after each loop execution. At PAI time, first the content of all dynpro fields that do not belong to any [table control](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentable_control_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or step loop and are not specified in any [FIELD](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/dynpfield.htm) statement are transported into the fields with the same name in the ABAP program. The contents of the fields of a table control or step loop are transported to the ABAP program row by row or group by group at the beginning of the respective loop run. The fields that are specified in the FIELD statements of the dynpro flow logic are transported upon execution of the corresponding FIELD statement.

Input and output fields must have a unique name (element attribute Name). Pure display elements such as text fields or frames are not associated with dynpro fields and do not necessarily need a unique name. When you create input and output fields by using fields from ABAP Dictionary, the system usually also creates field labels using texts from the dictionary. The default name for these text fields is the same name as the dynpro fields of the input and output fields.

Apart from the dynpro fields defined in Screen Painter, a dynpro also knows the [system fields](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensystem_field_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the ABAP program. In contrast to the program, these system fields are exclusively addressed as syst-name.

Notes

-   When dynpro fields are defined with reference to [flat structures](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenflat_structure_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in ABAP Dictionary, the global data objects with the same name of the ABAP program must be declared with the statement [TABLES](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abaptables.htm) as [interface work area](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abeninterface_work_area_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). Otherwise, there will be no data transport.

-   The attributes of dynpro fields that have not been created by copying from the program or ABAP Dictionary must be set in Screen Painter. In particular, the name of the [OK field](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenok_field_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") must be determined for every dynpro, so that the dynpro field will actually be analyzed by the runtime environment.

-   When dynpro fields with character-like dictionary type are passed, lowercase letters are transformed to uppercase letters by default. This behavior can be overridden in Screen Painter. Furthermore, [lowercase letters](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenddic_domains_sema.htm) can be preserved for data elements in the semantic attributes of a domain.

-   When dynpro fields are received from input fields on the screen, input fields are templates that expect a certain format depending on the data type of the underlying dynpro field. When passed to the dynpro field, the input is converted to a value of the appropriate type. This also means that some characters function as special characters by default.

-   The "!" character in the initial position of an input field on the screen deletes all characters in the field before the data transport.

-   The "=" character in the initial position of an input field on the screen initiates a search using [search helps](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensearch_help_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

-   If an input field contains only blanks and "\_" characters, the latter are transported as blanks.

To deactivate the template and also the modifying effect of special characters, the attribute Without Template can be activated in Screen Painter. However, the template cannot be deactivated for [selection screens](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_screen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

-   If the type of the dynpro field is a numeric type defined in ABAP Dictionary, the attribute sign must be set for the type attribute, so that negative numbers can be displayed on the screen. This setting is only possible for [domains](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendomain_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and not for specifying a built-in type directly for [data elements](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendata_element_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or structure components. If a negative number is enters in an input field, although the property is not set, the number is returned with an error message. If the associated ABAP data object when the dynpro is called contains a negative number, a non-handleable exception is raised.

-   On the screen, the content of dynpro fields is displayed as character-like. This means that the displayed value may differ from the internal representation. This applies in particular for the display of initial values. On the screen, all initial fields apart from those of type STRING or SSTRING are filled with blanks, while internally they contain a type-dependent initial value. Initial fields of type STRING and SSTRING are empty on the screen, which means that the cursor cannot be moved within the output length.

-   To enable explicit data transports between an ABAP program and dynpro fields, function modules such as DYNP\_UPDATE\_FIELDS are used.

-   ABAP fields of types string or xstring can be bound to dynpro fields of the same name, just like fields of fixed length. However, it should be noted that there are no dynpro fields of variable length. The length of a dynpro field is always defined in Screen Painter by the element attribute defLg. In data transports between strings in the ABAP program and dynpro fields of the same names, dynpro fields behave like target or source fields of fixed length, independent of their data type, and the respective [conversion rules](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenconversion_elementary.htm) apply, especially the following:

-   If, during the transport of a character string or byte string to a dynpro field, the string contains more characters than the length of the dynpro field, any surplus characters or bytes are cut off. Since a dynpro field may not exceed 132 characters of length, only up to 132 characters or bytes of a character string or byte string may be transported to the dynpro.

-   When transporting a character-like dynpro field to the ABAP program, trailing blanks are ignored.

These restrictions apply to the transport to and from normal input/output fields as well as to fields in table controls without an assigned internal table and to the use of dropdown boxes.

-   For special handling of [decimal floating point numbers](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendecfloat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), refer to [Decimal Floating Point Numbers](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenddic_decimal_floating_point.htm).

-   For special handling of fields of the type CURR, refer to [Currency Fields](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenddic_currency_field.htm).

-   For special handling of fields of the type QUAN, refer to [Quantity Fields](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenddic_quantity_field.htm).

Screens, Processing Input and Output Fields

The example shows how to process screen fields local in the program.

Source Code

PROGRAM demo\_dynpro\_input\_output.
DATA: input  TYPE i,
      output TYPE i,
      radio1(1) TYPE c, radio2(1) TYPE c, radio3(1) TYPE c,
      box1(1) TYPE c, box2(1) TYPE c, box3(1) TYPE c.
CALL SCREEN 100.
MODULE init\_screen\_100 OUTPUT.
  SET PF-STATUS 'SCREEN\_100'.
  CLEAR input.
  radio1 = 'X'.
  CLEAR: radio2, radio3.
ENDMODULE.
MODULE user\_command\_0100 INPUT.
  IF sy-ucomm = 'CANCEL'.
    LEAVE PROGRAM.
  ENDIF.
  output = input.
  box1 = radio1.
  box2 = radio2.
  box3 = radio3.
ENDMODULE.

Description

The static next screen number of screen 100 is 100. The screen fields of output, box1, box2, and box3 have been defined as not ready for input in Screen Painter. The length of input is specified so that the user can enter a nine-digit integer without thousands separators. However, the display in the output field contains up to two thousands separators. If the length of input had remained 11 digits, a runtime error could occur if users do not set thousand separators. The user entries in the input fields are passed to the ABAP program in the PAI event triggered by ENTER and then assigned to the output fields in the dialog module user\_command\_100. The next time the screen appears, the screen fields contain the appropriate values. The input fields are set in the dialog module init\_screen\_100 in the event PBO.

Description

The static next dynpro number of dynpro 100 is 100. The statement TABLES passes the components of the structure DEMO\_CONN from ABAP Dictionary. The structure DEMO\_CONN was especially created in ABAP Dictionary for dynpros of the flight data model. Apart from the components of the database table SPFLI, there is also a component MARK whose domain S\_FLAG only defines the fixed values " " and "X". On the dynpro, the ABAP Dictionary text for MARK is overwritten with "Cancel"; for all other fields the ABAP Dictionary fields are used. The input attribute of some fields was deactivated in Screen Painter. Users can enter values for the airline and flight number. In this process, the user is automatically assisted by the field and the input help and the valid value check against check tables of ABAP Dictionary. These checks are performed automatically before any dialog module is called in the ABAP program. It is not possible for the user to enter an airline not defined in the check table SCARR or to enter any flight numbers not matching the airlines defined in SPFLI, or to enter any values for MARK except " " and "X". Not all these checks need to be programmed in the ABAP program. The module user\_command\_0100 of the ABAP program reads additional values for the checked key from the database table SPFLI and sends them to the dynpro in the init\_screen\_100 event. The work area demo\_conn, declared using the statement TABLES is used as an interface, while the actual data from the database is edited in the work area wa\_spfli. If the user fills the Cancel field with "X", the program exits.

ENDMODULE.

Description

The static next screen number of screen 100 is 100. The screen field of output has been set as not ready for input in the Screen Painter. If the user chooses one of the pushbuttons, the event PAI is triggered. The function code of the pushbutton is assigned to the screen field ok\_code which in turn is assigned to the ABAP field of the same name. Then the module user\_command\_0100 is processed. First, the contents of the field ok\_code are assigned to the auxiliary variable save\_ok, and ok\_code is initialized. This procedure is always recommended since it makes sure that the screen field ok\_code is also reinitialized in the PBO event and does not contain any unintended value. The control structure CASE then assigns a text symbol to the output field depending on the pushbutton chosen which is then displayed in the output field of the screen, or the program is quit when the Cancel button is chosen.

Description

The static next screen number of screen 100 is 100. The screen fields field1 to field3 have been defined as not ready for input in the Screen Painter. Choosing one of the three radio buttons triggers the event PAI passing the function code RADIO and the field contents of the screenfields to the ABAP program. The dialog module user\_command\_0100 fills the fields field1 to field3 based on the radio button chosen. They are displayed when the screen is sent the next time. Choosing the checkbox also triggers the event PAI. In this case, the function CANCEL is passed to the ABAP program, and the dialog module user\_command\_0100 immediately ends the program.

Description

The static next-screen number of dynpro 100 is 0. There are four input fields STRING1, STRING2, CHAR1 and CHAR2 of type CHAR with a length of 10. In the dynpro flow logic no modules are called.

When executing the program, the screen is displayed with the values "123" and "1234567890" in the fields STRING1/CHAR1 and STRING2/CHAR2. After confirming with Continue, a list appears that displays the length of the content of the respective ABAP fields at PBO and PAI.

At PBO, STRING1 contains ten characters, seven of which are terminating blanks. These are lost during the assignment to CHAR1 and the character length of CHAR1 is only three.

At PAI, STRING1 contains only three characters, because the blanks are suppressed during the transport to and from the dynpro.

Both with STRING2 and with CHAR2 all characters that do not fit into the respective dynpro fields, are truncated.

Dynpro Flow and Dynpro Sequences

Dynpro Flow

[Dynpros](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendynpro_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") are called either using [transaction codes](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentransaction_code_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or using the statement [CALL SCREEN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapcall_screen.htm). The call raises the event [PBO](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenpbo_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and its event block is processed in the [dynpro flow logic](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendynpro_flow_logic_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). Afterwards, the [screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenscreen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the dynpro (dynamic program) is displayed in the current [popup level](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenpop-up_level_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or in a new level (in the case of modal dialog boxes). After a user action in the user interface of this GUI window, the event [PAI](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenpai_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") (or [POH](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenpoh_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or [POV](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenpov_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")) is raised and its event block is processed in the dynpro flow logic. In the event blocks of the dynpro flow logic, dialog modules of the associated ABAP program are called. When PAI processing is complete, the [next dynpro](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abennext_dynpro_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current dynpro is called.

The display language of a general dynpro is the [logon language](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenlogon_language_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and not the [text environment language](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentext_env_langu_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), which can be set with statement [SET LOCALE LANGUAGE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapset_locale.htm).

Dynpro Sequence

Each dynpro has a next dynpro. In particular, a dynpro can also have its own special next dynpro. The next dynpro is either statically predefined or it is set in the ABAP program using the statements [SET SCREEN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapset_screen.htm) or [LEAVE TO SCREEN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapleave_screen.htm). In this way, a dynpro is automatically part of a dynpro sequence. Each next dynpro always belongs to a single popup level and is executed in a single GUI window. The number of the current dynpro can be taken from the system field sy-dynnr.

The flow of a dynpro sequence is determined by the respective next dynpro of the dynpro in question. During processing, a dynpro always has a next dynpro. At the start of processing, this is statically predefined, but it can be overwritten in the program. The first dynpro of a dynpro sequence is the initial dynpro. A dynpro sequence is ended by calling the next dynpro with the dynpro number 0.

If a dynpro sequence is embedded in another sequence, the calling dynpro sequence is continued after completion of a dynpro sequence. If the dynpro sequence is not embedded, the current program is ended.

Description

Transaction DEMO\_SCREEN\_FLOW uses three screens. Screens 100 and 200 form a sequence. Screen 210 is a modal dialog box and is only called if specific conditions are met:

-   Screen 100: The user enters flight data, chooses Continue to request a detailed display of this data or ends the transaction.

-   Screen 200: The system displays all detail data for the flight in input fields. The user makes any changes required by overwriting the data displayed.

-   Screen 210: The modal dialog box appears only if the user attempts to quit screen 200 by choosing Back or Exit without saving the values modified. The dialog box allows the user to save the changes or cancel the process.

This transaction is a good example of how a screen sequence is implemented. To see how the modal dialog box is called, we have a closer look at screen 200. When processing the BACK or EXIT function codes, the PAI module must check if the flight data has been changed since it was last displayed or saved. If this is the case, screen 210 is to be called as a modal dialog box. The following sections of the flow logic for screen 200 are relevant here:

PROCESS AFTER INPUT.
MODULE exit\_0200 AT EXIT-COMMAND.
  ...
MODULE user\_command\_0200.

The system calls two dialog modules at the PAI event. The user interface of transaction DEMO\_SCREEN\_FLOW offers the functions Back, Exit, and Cancel as return commands. On screen 200, however, the user is only to be provided with the Cancel command to quit the screen immediately and return to screen 100. The corresponding function code is processed in module exit\_200. The next screen in the sequence is dynamically set to 100 and processing of screen 200 is ended immediately with LEAVE SCREEN. All other function codes for screen 200 are processed in module user\_command\_200:

-   The Save function triggers a database update.

-   The Exit and Back functions call subroutine safety\_check. This subroutine searches for any unsaved data on the screen and calls creen 210 if this is necessary.

If the Exit function is chosen (function code EXIT), the user leaves the transaction completely as the screen sequence is dynamically ended using SET SCREEN 0. If the function Back (function code BACK) is chosen, screen 100 is dynamically set as the next screen in the sequence using SET SCREEN 100.

The subroutine safety\_check first compares the current values of the screen fields with the values saved. If these values match, the user does not have to save the data, and the subroutine is ended. If the values do not match, safety\_check calls the modal dialog box of screen 210. The dialog box asks the user whether the data should be saved and returns the user's response as a function code in the field ok\_code. The static next screen of screen 210 is again screen 210. The processing logic (module user\_command\_210), however, always sets the next screen dynamically to 0 with the result that control passes back to the subroutine.

The following graphic summarizes the flow of the screen sequences in the example:

Subscreens, Tabstrips, and Splitter Controls

Subscreens are screens of special subscreen dynpros that can be included in other dynpros. Subscreens are either included directly, or using special [controls](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencontrol_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Including Subscreens Directly

The statement [CALL SUBSCREEN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/dynpcall.htm) can be used to insert other screens directly into the [screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenscreen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of a [dynpro](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendynpro_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in the form of subscreens. Subscreen areas must first be defined in the current screen of the dynpro. Every subscreen area has a unique name and can be configured to support changes in screen size. If the latter is defined, each size change in the current GUI window triggers the [PAI](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenpai_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") event.

Subscreens are the screens of special [subscreen dynpros](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensubscreen_dynpro_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). When a subscreen is inserted, the flow logic of the subscreen dynpro is also inserted. Subscreens can also insert other subscreens. Subscreens cannot have their own OK field. Instead, user actions on subscreens pass the function codes to the OK field of the dynpro that includes the subscreen. In the PAI event block of a subscreen dynpro, a [MODULE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/dynpmodule.htm) statement is never executed with the AT EXIT-COMMAND addition.

Note

Subscreens dynpros are defined like normal dynpros in [Screen Painter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenscreen_painter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and are flagged there as regular dynpros. [Selection screens](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselection-screen_subscreen.htm) can also be defined as subscreens.

Tabstrip Controls

A tabstrip control is a screen element that is made up of multiple tab pages. Every tab page contains a one line [tab title](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentab_title_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") associated with a function code and which can be used to select the tab page by clicking once. Under the tab title, a tab page is made up of a subscreen area. Each tab title must have a subscreen area assigned to it, in which any subscreens can be displayed. There are two ways to do this:

-   Browsing in SAP GUI
    A separate subscreen area is assigned to each tab title, and the function codes of the tab titles are defined with function type "P". If the user selects a tab title, the event PAI is not triggered. The associated subscreens are included once in each individual subscreen area by using the [CALL SUBSCREEN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/dynpcall.htm) statement of the flow logic. If the user selects a tab title, the SAP GUI browses to the associated tab page and displays its subscreen.

-   Browsing in ABAP Programs
    The same subscreen area is assigned to each tab title, and the function codes of the tab titles are defined without [typing](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentyping_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). If the user selects a tab title, the event PAI is triggered. The associated subscreen is included dynamically using the [CALL SUBSCREEN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/dynpcall.htm) statement of the flow logic in the subscreen area each time the user browses. In the ABAP program, the associated tab page must be activated using [CONTROLS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapcontrols.htm) and the correct subscreen dynpro for the subscreen area must be specified.

Note

If a tab title entry is selected when browsing in SAP GUI, input checks are not made and data is not transported to the ABAP program. Only if a user action triggers the PAI event are all the entries checked and the data of all screens transported. When browsing in the ABAP program, the input is checked each time a tab title is selected and the current tab page data is transported to the ABAP program of the subscreen dynpro.

Splitter Controls

A splitter control is a screen element that divides the area it covers into two [subscreen areas](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensubscreen_arrea_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), either horizontally beside each other or vertically one above the other. The division is made by a sash. The horizontal or vertical position of the sash is specified statically in the definition of the splitter control. It can be set to PBO in the ABAP program and changed by the user while the screen is being displayed.

Inserting [subscreen dynpros](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensubscreen_dynpro_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") into both subscreen areas takes place in exactly the same way as [direct insertion](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendynp_subscreen.htm) using the [CALL SUBSCREEN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/dynpcall.htm) statement in the dynpro flow logic. Any subscreens can be inserted, particularly those that contain splitter controls again.

In ABAP programs, the position of the sash of a splitter controls is controlled using an instance of the CL\_DYNPRO\_SPLITTER class. If, before sending this screen, an object of this class is created and its constructor is given the name of a splitter control, this is bound to the splitter control and its methods can be used to set and read the position of the sash. The sash position is specified by percentage and refers to the width or height of the splitter control. In the object, the position is represented by a private attribute. Important methods of the class are:

-   GET\_GUISASH
    At PAI sets the sash position of the object to the current value of the bound splitter control.

-   SET\_SASH
    If no value is passed to the POSITION parameter, the method sets the sash position of the bound splitter control at PBO to the value of the object. If a value is passed to the POSITION parameter, the method sets the attribute of the object and the sash position of the bound splitter control at PBO to this value. At PAI, only the attribute of the object is set.

-   GET\_SASH
    Gets the sash position of the bound splitter control at PBO and PAI.

A splitter control can have a [function code](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenfunction_code_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") assigned to it, which can be used to react to changes to the sash position made by the user in ABAP programs.

Notes

-   A splitter control can only be created in the alphanumeric Screen Painter by using Edit → Create Element → Splitter Control. For this reason it should only be used in cases when the functions offered are required on classic dynpros. Use [SAPUI5](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensapui5_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or [Web Dynpro ABAP](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenweb_dynpro_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") for new developments instead of classic dynpros.

-   Splitter controls offer certain advantages over the corresponding [CFW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencfw_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") containers. One advantage is that they allow all screen elements of a classic dynpro to be displayed directly in a flexible frame; another is that they have better performance than CFW controls. An example of intensive use of splitter controls is the flexible interface of ABAP Debugger.

CALL SUBSCREEN

Syntax

CALL SUBSCREEN sub\_area *\[*INCLUDING prog dynnr*\]*.

Variants:

[1\. CALL SUBSCREEN sub\_area INCLUDING prog dynnr.](#!ABAP_VARIANT_1@1@)
[2\. CALL SUBSCREEN sub\_area.](#!ABAP_VARIANT_2@2@)

Effect

Includes a [subscreen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensubscreen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in the [dynpro flow logic](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendynpro_flow_logic_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). There is one variant for event [PBO](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenpbo_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and one variant for event [PAI](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenpai_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The statement CALL SUBSCREEN cannot be used between the statements LOOP and ENDLOOP or CHAIN and ENDCHAIN.

Notes

-   The statement CALL SUBSCREEN is required for [directly including](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendynp_subscreen.htm) subscreens and for using [tabstrips](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendynp_tabstrip.htm) or [splitter controls](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendynp_splitter_control_spcl.htm) to include them.
    
-   An obsolete variant of this statement is [CALL CUSTOMER SUBSCREEN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/dynpcall_customer_subscreen.htm).
    

Variant 1

CALL SUBSCREEN sub\_area INCLUDING prog dynnr.

Effect

PBO

This statement is used to include the [subscreen dynpro](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensubscreen_dynpro_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the program defined in prog and the dynpro number defined in dynnr in the [subscreen area](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensubscreen_arrea_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") sub\_area of the current dynpro, and to process its PBO flow logic at this point. After PBO processing of the subscreen dynpro, the flow logic of the current dynpro is continued after the CALL statement.

The area sub\_area must be specified directly. prog expects either a two-character data object of the current ABAP program or a text field literal. dynnr expects a data object of the type n and length 4 from the current ABAP program or a text field literal. An exception that cannot be handled is raised if the specified subscreen dynpro cannot be found. If no subscreen dynpro is included for PBO in a subscreen area, the area remains empty.

If the specified subscreen dynpro is not defined in the current ABAP program, the specified program is loaded into the [internal session](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abeninternal_session_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and [LOAD-OF-PROGRAM](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapload-of-program.htm) is raised. If the object is a [function group](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenfunction_group_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), a new [additional program group](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenadditional_prog_group_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is created. If the object is an [executable program](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenexecutable_program_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or a [module pool](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenmodul_pool_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), the program is loaded to the [program group](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenprogram_group_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current program.

The flow logic of the subscreen dynpro calls the dialog modules of its own ABAP program and the global fields of its own program are transported to the subscreen dynpro . When a subscreen is being processed, sy-dynnr contains the dynpro number of the subscreen.

The GUI status and the current next dynpro cannot be changed in the dialog modules of the subscreen, and the statements SET *{* TITLEBAR *|* PF-STATUS *}* and *{* LEAVE *|* SET *}* SCREEN raise an exception there that cannot be handled.

Variant 2

CALL SUBSCREEN sub\_area.

Effect

PAI

The statement calls the PAI flow logic of the [subscreen dynpro](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensubscreen_dynpro_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") bound in the sub\_area [subscreen area](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensubscreen_arrea_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The subscreen dynpro must be included in the subscreen area for PBO (see variant 1). The same applies to the dialog modules called by the PAI flow logic as to the modules called by PBO. The data transport between the subscreen dynpro and its ABAP program is performed at the call, or is delayed when [FIELD](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/dynpfield.htm) statements are executed in the PAI flow logic of the subscreen logic.

Notes

-   If the use of subscreens means that the names of the displayed screen elements are not unique, multiple dynpro fields can be assigned to a global data object of the ABAP program, and, accordingly, multiple transports can be performed for PBO and PAI.
    
-   Since function codes from the subscreen dynpro are moved to the OK field of the including dynpro, it is advisable to give these function codes unique names.
    
-   Since the dynpro fields of subscreen dynpros are transported to the global data objects of the program in which the subscreen dynpros are defined, it must be ensured that the calling program is provided with this data when called externally. If reusable subscreen dynpros are to be defined, it is advisable to encapsulate them in function groups and to use function modules to enable the caller to set and use the global data.
    

Example

If a tabstrip control with untyped tabstrips and a subscreen area called SUB is defined on a dynpro, the associated dynpro flow logic can appear as follows. The statement CALL SUBSCREEN includes the subscreen dynpro of the same ABAP program whose number is in the ABAP data object dynnr in the subscreen area SUB. The associated programming section of the ABAP program is in the example for [CONTROLS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapcontrols_tabstrip.htm).

PROCESS BEFORE OUTPUT.
  MODULE prepare\_tabstrip.
  CALL SUBSCREEN sub INCLUDING sy-repid dynnr.
PROCESS AFTER INPUT.
  CALL SUBSCREEN sub.
  MODULE handle\_user\_command.

Description

The static next dynpro number of dynpro 100 is 100. Four pushbuttons with function codes "SUB1" to "SUB4" and two identically sized subscreen areas area1 and area2 have been created. In the same ABAP program, four subscreen dynpros 110 to 140 are defined. The input/output field of all four subscreen dynpro has the name field. The function codes of the pushbuttons on the subscreen dynpros 110 and 130 are OK1 and OK2. The screen flow logic for dynpro 100 is as follows:

PROCESS BEFORE OUTPUT.
  MODULE status\_100.
  CALL SUBSCREEN: area1 INCLUDING sy-repid number1,
                  area2 INCLUDING sy-repid number2.
PROCESS AFTER INPUT.
  MODULE cancel AT EXIT-COMMAND.
  MODULE save\_ok.
  CALL SUBSCREEN: area1,
                  area2.
  MODULE user\_command\_100.

The screen flow logic of subscreen dynpros 110 and 130 is:

PROCESS BEFORE OUTPUT.
  MODULE fill\_0110*|*0130.
PROCESS AFTER INPUT.
  MODULE user\_command\_0110*|*0130.

The screen flow logic of subscreen dynpros 120 and 140 is:

PROCESS BEFORE OUTPUT.
  MODULE fill\_0120*|*0150.
PROCESS AFTER INPUT.

When the program is executed, a screen appears on which subscreens 110 and 130 are displayed. The pushbuttons on the main dynpro allow the user to choose between two subscreen dynpros for each screen area. The pushbuttons on the subscreen dynpros 110 and 130 allow data to be passed to the subscreen dynpros 120 and 140.

Since all subscreen dynpros use the same field name field, the ABAP field with the same name is transported more than once at each PBO and PAI of the main dynpro. In the ABAP program, the values must therefore be cached in the helper fields field1 and field2.

The function code of the pushbuttons of the subscreen dynpros is different and regular handling in an ABAP field is enough. If the function codes had the same names, it would be necessary to use multiple helper fields here as well.

Description

The static subsequent screen number of screen 100 is 100. It is a tabstrip page called mytabstrip created with three tabs, PUSH1, PUSH2, PUSH3 and function codes with the same names (type p). One of three identically sized subscreen areas, sub1 to sub3, is assigned to each tab. The button is called BUTTON and has the function code 'OK'. In addition three subscreens, 110 to 130, are defined. These subscreens fit into the above mentioned subscreen areas. The screen flow logic of the subscreens 110 to 130 does not contain any module calls.

When the program is executed, the user sees a screen, the second tab page of which is active because before screen 100 is called, the component activetab of the structure mytabstrip is set to PUSH2. The user can scroll between the tab pages without triggering the PAI event. Each tab page has one of the three subscreens attached to it.

By selecting the Continue button, the PAI event is triggered and a message shows the function code of the tab assigned to the currently active tab page.

Description

The static next dynpro number of dynpro 100 is 100. The layout of dynpro 100 and the subscreen dynpros 110 to 130 is the same as in the [executable example](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentab_strip_control1_abexa.htm) with local scrolling. The function codes of the three tab titles are not typed and a common subscreen area sub is assigned to all tab titles.

The screen flow logic of dynpro 100 makes a dynamic binding to PBO, a subscreen dynpro in the subscreen area sub. The screen flow logic of subscreen dynpros 110 to 130 does not contain any module calls.

This example works in exactly the same way as the [example with local scrolling](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentab_strip_control1_abexa.htm) except that scrolling between the tabstrip pages is programmed in the ABAP program. Every time a tab title is selected, it is assigned the function code of the OK field in the activetab component of the mytabstrip structure. At the same time, the variable number is given the dynpro number of the subscreen dynpro to be displayed in the subscreen area SUB of the tabstrip.

Subscreens, Tabstrips, and Splitter Controls

Subscreens are screens of special subscreen dynpros that can be included in other dynpros. Subscreens are either included directly, or using special [controls](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencontrol_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Including Subscreens Directly

The statement [CALL SUBSCREEN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/dynpcall.htm) can be used to insert other screens directly into the [screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenscreen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of a [dynpro](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendynpro_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in the form of subscreens. Subscreen areas must first be defined in the current screen of the dynpro. Every subscreen area has a unique name and can be configured to support changes in screen size. If the latter is defined, each size change in the current GUI window triggers the [PAI](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenpai_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") event.

Subscreens are the screens of special [subscreen dynpros](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensubscreen_dynpro_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). When a subscreen is inserted, the flow logic of the subscreen dynpro is also inserted. Subscreens can also insert other subscreens. Subscreens cannot have their own OK field. Instead, user actions on subscreens pass the function codes to the OK field of the dynpro that includes the subscreen. In the PAI event block of a subscreen dynpro, a [MODULE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/dynpmodule.htm) statement is never executed with the AT EXIT-COMMAND addition.

Note

Subscreens dynpros are defined like normal dynpros in [Screen Painter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenscreen_painter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and are flagged there as regular dynpros. [Selection screens](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselection-screen_subscreen.htm) can also be defined as subscreens.

Tabstrip Controls

A tabstrip control is a screen element that is made up of multiple tab pages. Every tab page contains a one line [tab title](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentab_title_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") associated with a function code and which can be used to select the tab page by clicking once. Under the tab title, a tab page is made up of a subscreen area. Each tab title must have a subscreen area assigned to it, in which any subscreens can be displayed. There are two ways to do this:

-   Browsing in SAP GUI
    A separate subscreen area is assigned to each tab title, and the function codes of the tab titles are defined with function type "P". If the user selects a tab title, the event PAI is not triggered. The associated subscreens are included once in each individual subscreen area by using the [CALL SUBSCREEN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/dynpcall.htm) statement of the flow logic. If the user selects a tab title, the SAP GUI browses to the associated tab page and displays its subscreen.

-   Browsing in ABAP Programs
    The same subscreen area is assigned to each tab title, and the function codes of the tab titles are defined without [typing](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentyping_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). If the user selects a tab title, the event PAI is triggered. The associated subscreen is included dynamically using the [CALL SUBSCREEN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/dynpcall.htm) statement of the flow logic in the subscreen area each time the user browses. In the ABAP program, the associated tab page must be activated using [CONTROLS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapcontrols.htm) and the correct subscreen dynpro for the subscreen area must be specified.

Note

If a tab title entry is selected when browsing in SAP GUI, input checks are not made and data is not transported to the ABAP program. Only if a user action triggers the PAI event are all the entries checked and the data of all screens transported. When browsing in the ABAP program, the input is checked each time a tab title is selected and the current tab page data is transported to the ABAP program of the subscreen dynpro.

Splitter Controls

A splitter control is a screen element that divides the area it covers into two [subscreen areas](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensubscreen_arrea_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), either horizontally beside each other or vertically one above the other. The division is made by a sash. The horizontal or vertical position of the sash is specified statically in the definition of the splitter control. It can be set to PBO in the ABAP program and changed by the user while the screen is being displayed.

Inserting [subscreen dynpros](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensubscreen_dynpro_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") into both subscreen areas takes place in exactly the same way as [direct insertion](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendynp_subscreen.htm) using the [CALL SUBSCREEN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/dynpcall.htm) statement in the dynpro flow logic. Any subscreens can be inserted, particularly those that contain splitter controls again.

In ABAP programs, the position of the sash of a splitter controls is controlled using an instance of the CL\_DYNPRO\_SPLITTER class. If, before sending this screen, an object of this class is created and its constructor is given the name of a splitter control, this is bound to the splitter control and its methods can be used to set and read the position of the sash. The sash position is specified by percentage and refers to the width or height of the splitter control. In the object, the position is represented by a private attribute. Important methods of the class are:

-   GET\_GUISASH
    At PAI sets the sash position of the object to the current value of the bound splitter control.

-   SET\_SASH
    If no value is passed to the POSITION parameter, the method sets the sash position of the bound splitter control at PBO to the value of the object. If a value is passed to the POSITION parameter, the method sets the attribute of the object and the sash position of the bound splitter control at PBO to this value. At PAI, only the attribute of the object is set.

-   GET\_SASH
    Gets the sash position of the bound splitter control at PBO and PAI.

A splitter control can have a [function code](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenfunction_code_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") assigned to it, which can be used to react to changes to the sash position made by the user in ABAP programs.

Notes

-   A splitter control can only be created in the alphanumeric Screen Painter by using Edit → Create Element → Splitter Control. For this reason it should only be used in cases when the functions offered are required on classic dynpros. Use [SAPUI5](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensapui5_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or [Web Dynpro ABAP](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenweb_dynpro_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") for new developments instead of classic dynpros.

-   Splitter controls offer certain advantages over the corresponding [CFW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencfw_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") containers. One advantage is that they allow all screen elements of a classic dynpro to be displayed directly in a flexible frame; another is that they have better performance than CFW controls. An example of intensive use of splitter controls is the flexible interface of ABAP Debugger.

CALL SUBSCREEN

Syntax

CALL SUBSCREEN sub\_area *\[*INCLUDING prog dynnr*\]*.

Variants:

[1\. CALL SUBSCREEN sub\_area INCLUDING prog dynnr.](#!ABAP_VARIANT_1@1@)
[2\. CALL SUBSCREEN sub\_area.](#!ABAP_VARIANT_2@2@)

Effect

Includes a [subscreen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensubscreen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in the [dynpro flow logic](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendynpro_flow_logic_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). There is one variant for event [PBO](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenpbo_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and one variant for event [PAI](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenpai_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The statement CALL SUBSCREEN cannot be used between the statements LOOP and ENDLOOP or CHAIN and ENDCHAIN.

Notes

-   The statement CALL SUBSCREEN is required for [directly including](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendynp_subscreen.htm) subscreens and for using [tabstrips](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendynp_tabstrip.htm) or [splitter controls](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendynp_splitter_control_spcl.htm) to include them.
    
-   An obsolete variant of this statement is [CALL CUSTOMER SUBSCREEN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/dynpcall_customer_subscreen.htm).
    

Variant 1

CALL SUBSCREEN sub\_area INCLUDING prog dynnr.

Effect

PBO

This statement is used to include the [subscreen dynpro](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensubscreen_dynpro_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the program defined in prog and the dynpro number defined in dynnr in the [subscreen area](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensubscreen_arrea_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") sub\_area of the current dynpro, and to process its PBO flow logic at this point. After PBO processing of the subscreen dynpro, the flow logic of the current dynpro is continued after the CALL statement.

The area sub\_area must be specified directly. prog expects either a two-character data object of the current ABAP program or a text field literal. dynnr expects a data object of the type n and length 4 from the current ABAP program or a text field literal. An exception that cannot be handled is raised if the specified subscreen dynpro cannot be found. If no subscreen dynpro is included for PBO in a subscreen area, the area remains empty.

If the specified subscreen dynpro is not defined in the current ABAP program, the specified program is loaded into the [internal session](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abeninternal_session_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and [LOAD-OF-PROGRAM](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapload-of-program.htm) is raised. If the object is a [function group](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenfunction_group_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), a new [additional program group](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenadditional_prog_group_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is created. If the object is an [executable program](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenexecutable_program_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or a [module pool](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenmodul_pool_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), the program is loaded to the [program group](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenprogram_group_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current program.

The flow logic of the subscreen dynpro calls the dialog modules of its own ABAP program and the global fields of its own program are transported to the subscreen dynpro . When a subscreen is being processed, sy-dynnr contains the dynpro number of the subscreen.

The GUI status and the current next dynpro cannot be changed in the dialog modules of the subscreen, and the statements SET *{* TITLEBAR *|* PF-STATUS *}* and *{* LEAVE *|* SET *}* SCREEN raise an exception there that cannot be handled.

Variant 2

CALL SUBSCREEN sub\_area.

Effect

PAI

The statement calls the PAI flow logic of the [subscreen dynpro](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensubscreen_dynpro_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") bound in the sub\_area [subscreen area](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensubscreen_arrea_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The subscreen dynpro must be included in the subscreen area for PBO (see variant 1). The same applies to the dialog modules called by the PAI flow logic as to the modules called by PBO. The data transport between the subscreen dynpro and its ABAP program is performed at the call, or is delayed when [FIELD](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/dynpfield.htm) statements are executed in the PAI flow logic of the subscreen logic.

Notes

-   If the use of subscreens means that the names of the displayed screen elements are not unique, multiple dynpro fields can be assigned to a global data object of the ABAP program, and, accordingly, multiple transports can be performed for PBO and PAI.
    
-   Since function codes from the subscreen dynpro are moved to the OK field of the including dynpro, it is advisable to give these function codes unique names.
    
-   Since the dynpro fields of subscreen dynpros are transported to the global data objects of the program in which the subscreen dynpros are defined, it must be ensured that the calling program is provided with this data when called externally. If reusable subscreen dynpros are to be defined, it is advisable to encapsulate them in function groups and to use function modules to enable the caller to set and use the global data.
    

Example

If a tabstrip control with untyped tabstrips and a subscreen area called SUB is defined on a dynpro, the associated dynpro flow logic can appear as follows. The statement CALL SUBSCREEN includes the subscreen dynpro of the same ABAP program whose number is in the ABAP data object dynnr in the subscreen area SUB. The associated programming section of the ABAP program is in the example for [CONTROLS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapcontrols_tabstrip.htm).

PROCESS BEFORE OUTPUT.
  MODULE prepare\_tabstrip.
  CALL SUBSCREEN sub INCLUDING sy-repid dynnr.
PROCESS AFTER INPUT.
  CALL SUBSCREEN sub.
  MODULE handle\_user\_command.

Description

The static next dynpro number of dynpro 100 is 100. Four pushbuttons with function codes "SUB1" to "SUB4" and two identically sized subscreen areas area1 and area2 have been created. In the same ABAP program, four subscreen dynpros 110 to 140 are defined. The input/output field of all four subscreen dynpro has the name field. The function codes of the pushbuttons on the subscreen dynpros 110 and 130 are OK1 and OK2. The screen flow logic for dynpro 100 is as follows:

PROCESS BEFORE OUTPUT.
  MODULE status\_100.
  CALL SUBSCREEN: area1 INCLUDING sy-repid number1,
                  area2 INCLUDING sy-repid number2.
PROCESS AFTER INPUT.
  MODULE cancel AT EXIT-COMMAND.
  MODULE save\_ok.
  CALL SUBSCREEN: area1,
                  area2.
  MODULE user\_command\_100.

The screen flow logic of subscreen dynpros 110 and 130 is:

PROCESS BEFORE OUTPUT.
  MODULE fill\_0110*|*0130.
PROCESS AFTER INPUT.
  MODULE user\_command\_0110*|*0130.

The screen flow logic of subscreen dynpros 120 and 140 is:

PROCESS BEFORE OUTPUT.
  MODULE fill\_0120*|*0150.
PROCESS AFTER INPUT.

When the program is executed, a screen appears on which subscreens 110 and 130 are displayed. The pushbuttons on the main dynpro allow the user to choose between two subscreen dynpros for each screen area. The pushbuttons on the subscreen dynpros 110 and 130 allow data to be passed to the subscreen dynpros 120 and 140.

Since all subscreen dynpros use the same field name field, the ABAP field with the same name is transported more than once at each PBO and PAI of the main dynpro. In the ABAP program, the values must therefore be cached in the helper fields field1 and field2.

The function code of the pushbuttons of the subscreen dynpros is different and regular handling in an ABAP field is enough. If the function codes had the same names, it would be necessary to use multiple helper fields here as well.

Description

The static subsequent screen number of screen 100 is 100. It is a tabstrip page called mytabstrip created with three tabs, PUSH1, PUSH2, PUSH3 and function codes with the same names (type p). One of three identically sized subscreen areas, sub1 to sub3, is assigned to each tab. The button is called BUTTON and has the function code 'OK'. In addition three subscreens, 110 to 130, are defined. These subscreens fit into the above mentioned subscreen areas. The screen flow logic of the subscreens 110 to 130 does not contain any module calls.

When the program is executed, the user sees a screen, the second tab page of which is active because before screen 100 is called, the component activetab of the structure mytabstrip is set to PUSH2. The user can scroll between the tab pages without triggering the PAI event. Each tab page has one of the three subscreens attached to it.

By selecting the Continue button, the PAI event is triggered and a message shows the function code of the tab assigned to the currently active tab page.

Description

The static next dynpro number of dynpro 100 is 100. The layout of dynpro 100 and the subscreen dynpros 110 to 130 is the same as in the [executable example](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentab_strip_control1_abexa.htm) with local scrolling. The function codes of the three tab titles are not typed and a common subscreen area sub is assigned to all tab titles.

The screen flow logic of dynpro 100 makes a dynamic binding to PBO, a subscreen dynpro in the subscreen area sub. The screen flow logic of subscreen dynpros 110 to 130 does not contain any module calls.

This example works in exactly the same way as the [example with local scrolling](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentab_strip_control1_abexa.htm) except that scrolling between the tabstrip pages is programmed in the ABAP program. Every time a tab title is selected, it is assigned the function code of the OK field in the activetab component of the mytabstrip structure. At the same time, the variable number is given the dynpro number of the subscreen dynpro to be displayed in the subscreen area SUB of the tabstrip.

Including Subscreens Directly

The statement [CALL SUBSCREEN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/dynpcall.htm) can be used to insert other screens directly into the [screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenscreen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of a [dynpro](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendynpro_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in the form of subscreens. Subscreen areas must first be defined in the current screen of the dynpro. Every subscreen area has a unique name and can be configured to support changes in screen size. If the latter is defined, each size change in the current GUI window triggers the [PAI](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenpai_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") event.

Subscreens are the screens of special [subscreen dynpros](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensubscreen_dynpro_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). When a subscreen is inserted, the flow logic of the subscreen dynpro is also inserted. Subscreens can also insert other subscreens. Subscreens cannot have their own OK field. Instead, user actions on subscreens pass the function codes to the OK field of the dynpro that includes the subscreen. In the PAI event block of a subscreen dynpro, a [MODULE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/dynpmodule.htm) statement is never executed with the AT EXIT-COMMAND addition.

Note

Subscreens dynpros are defined like normal dynpros in [Screen Painter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenscreen_painter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and are flagged there as regular dynpros. [Selection screens](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselection-screen_subscreen.htm) can also be defined as subscreens.

Tabstrip Controls

A tabstrip control is a screen element that is made up of multiple tab pages. Every tab page contains a one line [tab title](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentab_title_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") associated with a function code and which can be used to select the tab page by clicking once. Under the tab title, a tab page is made up of a subscreen area. Each tab title must have a subscreen area assigned to it, in which any subscreens can be displayed. There are two ways to do this:

-   Browsing in SAP GUI
    A separate subscreen area is assigned to each tab title, and the function codes of the tab titles are defined with function type "P". If the user selects a tab title, the event PAI is not triggered. The associated subscreens are included once in each individual subscreen area by using the [CALL SUBSCREEN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/dynpcall.htm) statement of the flow logic. If the user selects a tab title, the SAP GUI browses to the associated tab page and displays its subscreen.

-   Browsing in ABAP Programs
    The same subscreen area is assigned to each tab title, and the function codes of the tab titles are defined without [typing](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentyping_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). If the user selects a tab title, the event PAI is triggered. The associated subscreen is included dynamically using the [CALL SUBSCREEN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/dynpcall.htm) statement of the flow logic in the subscreen area each time the user browses. In the ABAP program, the associated tab page must be activated using [CONTROLS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapcontrols.htm) and the correct subscreen dynpro for the subscreen area must be specified.

Note

If a tab title entry is selected when browsing in SAP GUI, input checks are not made and data is not transported to the ABAP program. Only if a user action triggers the PAI event are all the entries checked and the data of all screens transported. When browsing in the ABAP program, the input is checked each time a tab title is selected and the current tab page data is transported to the ABAP program of the subscreen dynpro.

Splitter Controls

A splitter control is a screen element that divides the area it covers into two [subscreen areas](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensubscreen_arrea_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), either horizontally beside each other or vertically one above the other. The division is made by a sash. The horizontal or vertical position of the sash is specified statically in the definition of the splitter control. It can be set to PBO in the ABAP program and changed by the user while the screen is being displayed.

Inserting [subscreen dynpros](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensubscreen_dynpro_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") into both subscreen areas takes place in exactly the same way as [direct insertion](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendynp_subscreen.htm) using the [CALL SUBSCREEN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/dynpcall.htm) statement in the dynpro flow logic. Any subscreens can be inserted, particularly those that contain splitter controls again.

In ABAP programs, the position of the sash of a splitter controls is controlled using an instance of the CL\_DYNPRO\_SPLITTER class. If, before sending this screen, an object of this class is created and its constructor is given the name of a splitter control, this is bound to the splitter control and its methods can be used to set and read the position of the sash. The sash position is specified by percentage and refers to the width or height of the splitter control. In the object, the position is represented by a private attribute. Important methods of the class are:

-   GET\_GUISASH
    At PAI sets the sash position of the object to the current value of the bound splitter control.

-   SET\_SASH
    If no value is passed to the POSITION parameter, the method sets the sash position of the bound splitter control at PBO to the value of the object. If a value is passed to the POSITION parameter, the method sets the attribute of the object and the sash position of the bound splitter control at PBO to this value. At PAI, only the attribute of the object is set.

-   GET\_SASH
    Gets the sash position of the bound splitter control at PBO and PAI.

A splitter control can have a [function code](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenfunction_code_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") assigned to it, which can be used to react to changes to the sash position made by the user in ABAP programs.

Notes

-   A splitter control can only be created in the alphanumeric Screen Painter by using Edit → Create Element → Splitter Control. For this reason it should only be used in cases when the functions offered are required on classic dynpros. Use [SAPUI5](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensapui5_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or [Web Dynpro ABAP](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenweb_dynpro_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") for new developments instead of classic dynpros.

-   Splitter controls offer certain advantages over the corresponding [CFW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencfw_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") containers. One advantage is that they allow all screen elements of a classic dynpro to be displayed directly in a flexible frame; another is that they have better performance than CFW controls. An example of intensive use of splitter controls is the flexible interface of ABAP Debugger.

CALL SUBSCREEN

Syntax

CALL SUBSCREEN sub\_area *\[*INCLUDING prog dynnr*\]*.

Variants:

[1\. CALL SUBSCREEN sub\_area INCLUDING prog dynnr.](#!ABAP_VARIANT_1@1@)
[2\. CALL SUBSCREEN sub\_area.](#!ABAP_VARIANT_2@2@)

Effect

Includes a [subscreen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensubscreen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in the [dynpro flow logic](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendynpro_flow_logic_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). There is one variant for event [PBO](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenpbo_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and one variant for event [PAI](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenpai_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The statement CALL SUBSCREEN cannot be used between the statements LOOP and ENDLOOP or CHAIN and ENDCHAIN.

Notes

-   The statement CALL SUBSCREEN is required for [directly including](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendynp_subscreen.htm) subscreens and for using [tabstrips](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendynp_tabstrip.htm) or [splitter controls](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendynp_splitter_control_spcl.htm) to include them.
    
-   An obsolete variant of this statement is [CALL CUSTOMER SUBSCREEN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/dynpcall_customer_subscreen.htm).
    

Variant 1

CALL SUBSCREEN sub\_area INCLUDING prog dynnr.

Effect

PBO

This statement is used to include the [subscreen dynpro](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensubscreen_dynpro_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the program defined in prog and the dynpro number defined in dynnr in the [subscreen area](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensubscreen_arrea_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") sub\_area of the current dynpro, and to process its PBO flow logic at this point. After PBO processing of the subscreen dynpro, the flow logic of the current dynpro is continued after the CALL statement.

The area sub\_area must be specified directly. prog expects either a two-character data object of the current ABAP program or a text field literal. dynnr expects a data object of the type n and length 4 from the current ABAP program or a text field literal. An exception that cannot be handled is raised if the specified subscreen dynpro cannot be found. If no subscreen dynpro is included for PBO in a subscreen area, the area remains empty.

If the specified subscreen dynpro is not defined in the current ABAP program, the specified program is loaded into the [internal session](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abeninternal_session_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and [LOAD-OF-PROGRAM](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapload-of-program.htm) is raised. If the object is a [function group](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenfunction_group_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), a new [additional program group](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenadditional_prog_group_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is created. If the object is an [executable program](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenexecutable_program_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or a [module pool](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenmodul_pool_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), the program is loaded to the [program group](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenprogram_group_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current program.

The flow logic of the subscreen dynpro calls the dialog modules of its own ABAP program and the global fields of its own program are transported to the subscreen dynpro . When a subscreen is being processed, sy-dynnr contains the dynpro number of the subscreen.

The GUI status and the current next dynpro cannot be changed in the dialog modules of the subscreen, and the statements SET *{* TITLEBAR *|* PF-STATUS *}* and *{* LEAVE *|* SET *}* SCREEN raise an exception there that cannot be handled.

Variant 2

CALL SUBSCREEN sub\_area.

Effect

PAI

The statement calls the PAI flow logic of the [subscreen dynpro](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensubscreen_dynpro_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") bound in the sub\_area [subscreen area](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensubscreen_arrea_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The subscreen dynpro must be included in the subscreen area for PBO (see variant 1). The same applies to the dialog modules called by the PAI flow logic as to the modules called by PBO. The data transport between the subscreen dynpro and its ABAP program is performed at the call, or is delayed when [FIELD](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/dynpfield.htm) statements are executed in the PAI flow logic of the subscreen logic.

Notes

-   If the use of subscreens means that the names of the displayed screen elements are not unique, multiple dynpro fields can be assigned to a global data object of the ABAP program, and, accordingly, multiple transports can be performed for PBO and PAI.
    
-   Since function codes from the subscreen dynpro are moved to the OK field of the including dynpro, it is advisable to give these function codes unique names.
    
-   Since the dynpro fields of subscreen dynpros are transported to the global data objects of the program in which the subscreen dynpros are defined, it must be ensured that the calling program is provided with this data when called externally. If reusable subscreen dynpros are to be defined, it is advisable to encapsulate them in function groups and to use function modules to enable the caller to set and use the global data.
    

Example

If a tabstrip control with untyped tabstrips and a subscreen area called SUB is defined on a dynpro, the associated dynpro flow logic can appear as follows. The statement CALL SUBSCREEN includes the subscreen dynpro of the same ABAP program whose number is in the ABAP data object dynnr in the subscreen area SUB. The associated programming section of the ABAP program is in the example for [CONTROLS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapcontrols_tabstrip.htm).

PROCESS BEFORE OUTPUT.
  MODULE prepare\_tabstrip.
  CALL SUBSCREEN sub INCLUDING sy-repid dynnr.
PROCESS AFTER INPUT.
  CALL SUBSCREEN sub.
  MODULE handle\_user\_command.

Description

The static next dynpro number of dynpro 100 is 100. Four pushbuttons with function codes "SUB1" to "SUB4" and two identically sized subscreen areas area1 and area2 have been created. In the same ABAP program, four subscreen dynpros 110 to 140 are defined. The input/output field of all four subscreen dynpro has the name field. The function codes of the pushbuttons on the subscreen dynpros 110 and 130 are OK1 and OK2. The screen flow logic for dynpro 100 is as follows:

PROCESS BEFORE OUTPUT.
  MODULE status\_100.
  CALL SUBSCREEN: area1 INCLUDING sy-repid number1,
                  area2 INCLUDING sy-repid number2.
PROCESS AFTER INPUT.
  MODULE cancel AT EXIT-COMMAND.
  MODULE save\_ok.
  CALL SUBSCREEN: area1,
                  area2.
  MODULE user\_command\_100.

The screen flow logic of subscreen dynpros 110 and 130 is:

PROCESS BEFORE OUTPUT.
  MODULE fill\_0110*|*0130.
PROCESS AFTER INPUT.
  MODULE user\_command\_0110*|*0130.

The screen flow logic of subscreen dynpros 120 and 140 is:

PROCESS BEFORE OUTPUT.
  MODULE fill\_0120*|*0150.
PROCESS AFTER INPUT.

When the program is executed, a screen appears on which subscreens 110 and 130 are displayed. The pushbuttons on the main dynpro allow the user to choose between two subscreen dynpros for each screen area. The pushbuttons on the subscreen dynpros 110 and 130 allow data to be passed to the subscreen dynpros 120 and 140.

Since all subscreen dynpros use the same field name field, the ABAP field with the same name is transported more than once at each PBO and PAI of the main dynpro. In the ABAP program, the values must therefore be cached in the helper fields field1 and field2.

The function code of the pushbuttons of the subscreen dynpros is different and regular handling in an ABAP field is enough. If the function codes had the same names, it would be necessary to use multiple helper fields here as well.

Screens, Tabstrips with scrolling in the SAP GUI

This example demonstrates the use of tabstrip controls with local scrolling.

Description

The static subsequent screen number of screen 100 is 100. It is a tabstrip page called mytabstrip created with three tabs, PUSH1, PUSH2, PUSH3 and function codes with the same names (type p). One of three identically sized subscreen areas, sub1 to sub3, is assigned to each tab. The button is called BUTTON and has the function code 'OK'. In addition three subscreens, 110 to 130, are defined. These subscreens fit into the above mentioned subscreen areas. The screen flow logic of the subscreens 110 to 130 does not contain any module calls.

When the program is executed, the user sees a screen, the second tab page of which is active because before screen 100 is called, the component activetab of the structure mytabstrip is set to PUSH2. The user can scroll between the tab pages without triggering the PAI event. Each tab page has one of the three subscreens attached to it.

By selecting the Continue button, the PAI event is triggered and a message shows the function code of the tab assigned to the currently active tab page.

Description

The static next dynpro number of dynpro 100 is 100. The layout of dynpro 100 and the subscreen dynpros 110 to 130 is the same as in the [executable example](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentab_strip_control1_abexa.htm) with local scrolling. The function codes of the three tab titles are not typed and a common subscreen area sub is assigned to all tab titles.

The screen flow logic of dynpro 100 makes a dynamic binding to PBO, a subscreen dynpro in the subscreen area sub. The screen flow logic of subscreen dynpros 110 to 130 does not contain any module calls.

This example works in exactly the same way as the [example with local scrolling](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentab_strip_control1_abexa.htm) except that scrolling between the tabstrip pages is programmed in the ABAP program. Every time a tab title is selected, it is assigned the function code of the OK field in the activetab component of the mytabstrip structure. At the same time, the variable number is given the dynpro number of the subscreen dynpro to be displayed in the subscreen area SUB of the tabstrip.

Subscreens, Tabstrips, and Splitter Controls

Subscreens are screens of special subscreen dynpros that can be included in other dynpros. Subscreens are either included directly, or using special [controls](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencontrol_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

[ABAP - Keyword Documentation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenabap.htm) →  [ABAP - Reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenabap_reference.htm) →  [SAP GUI User Dialogs](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenabap_screens.htm) →  [Dynpros](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenabap_dynpros.htm) →  [Statements in the Screen Flow Logic](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenabap_dynpros_dynpro_statements.htm) →  [Subscreens, Tabstrips, and Splitter Controls](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendynp_subscreens.htm) → 

Including Subscreens Directly

The statement [CALL SUBSCREEN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/dynpcall.htm) can be used to insert other screens directly into the [screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenscreen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of a [dynpro](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendynpro_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in the form of subscreens. Subscreen areas must first be defined in the current screen of the dynpro. Every subscreen area has a unique name and can be configured to support changes in screen size. If the latter is defined, each size change in the current GUI window triggers the [PAI](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenpai_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") event.

Subscreens are the screens of special [subscreen dynpros](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensubscreen_dynpro_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). When a subscreen is inserted, the flow logic of the subscreen dynpro is also inserted. Subscreens can also insert other subscreens. Subscreens cannot have their own OK field. Instead, user actions on subscreens pass the function codes to the OK field of the dynpro that includes the subscreen. In the PAI event block of a subscreen dynpro, a [MODULE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/dynpmodule.htm) statement is never executed with the AT EXIT-COMMAND addition.

Note

Subscreens dynpros are defined like normal dynpros in [Screen Painter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenscreen_painter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and are flagged there as regular dynpros. [Selection screens](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselection-screen_subscreen.htm) can also be defined as subscreens.

Tabstrip Controls

A tabstrip control is a screen element that is made up of multiple tab pages. Every tab page contains a one line [tab title](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentab_title_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") associated with a function code and which can be used to select the tab page by clicking once. Under the tab title, a tab page is made up of a subscreen area. Each tab title must have a subscreen area assigned to it, in which any subscreens can be displayed. There are two ways to do this:

-   Browsing in SAP GUI
    A separate subscreen area is assigned to each tab title, and the function codes of the tab titles are defined with function type "P". If the user selects a tab title, the event PAI is not triggered. The associated subscreens are included once in each individual subscreen area by using the [CALL SUBSCREEN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/dynpcall.htm) statement of the flow logic. If the user selects a tab title, the SAP GUI browses to the associated tab page and displays its subscreen.

-   Browsing in ABAP Programs
    The same subscreen area is assigned to each tab title, and the function codes of the tab titles are defined without [typing](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentyping_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). If the user selects a tab title, the event PAI is triggered. The associated subscreen is included dynamically using the [CALL SUBSCREEN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/dynpcall.htm) statement of the flow logic in the subscreen area each time the user browses. In the ABAP program, the associated tab page must be activated using [CONTROLS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapcontrols.htm) and the correct subscreen dynpro for the subscreen area must be specified.

Note

If a tab title entry is selected when browsing in SAP GUI, input checks are not made and data is not transported to the ABAP program. Only if a user action triggers the PAI event are all the entries checked and the data of all screens transported. When browsing in the ABAP program, the input is checked each time a tab title is selected and the current tab page data is transported to the ABAP program of the subscreen dynpro.

Splitter Controls

A splitter control is a screen element that divides the area it covers into two [subscreen areas](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensubscreen_arrea_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), either horizontally beside each other or vertically one above the other. The division is made by a sash. The horizontal or vertical position of the sash is specified statically in the definition of the splitter control. It can be set to PBO in the ABAP program and changed by the user while the screen is being displayed.

Inserting [subscreen dynpros](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensubscreen_dynpro_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") into both subscreen areas takes place in exactly the same way as [direct insertion](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendynp_subscreen.htm) using the [CALL SUBSCREEN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/dynpcall.htm) statement in the dynpro flow logic. Any subscreens can be inserted, particularly those that contain splitter controls again.

In ABAP programs, the position of the sash of a splitter controls is controlled using an instance of the CL\_DYNPRO\_SPLITTER class. If, before sending this screen, an object of this class is created and its constructor is given the name of a splitter control, this is bound to the splitter control and its methods can be used to set and read the position of the sash. The sash position is specified by percentage and refers to the width or height of the splitter control. In the object, the position is represented by a private attribute. Important methods of the class are:

-   GET\_GUISASH
    At PAI sets the sash position of the object to the current value of the bound splitter control.

-   SET\_SASH
    If no value is passed to the POSITION parameter, the method sets the sash position of the bound splitter control at PBO to the value of the object. If a value is passed to the POSITION parameter, the method sets the attribute of the object and the sash position of the bound splitter control at PBO to this value. At PAI, only the attribute of the object is set.

-   GET\_SASH
    Gets the sash position of the bound splitter control at PBO and PAI.

A splitter control can have a [function code](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenfunction_code_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") assigned to it, which can be used to react to changes to the sash position made by the user in ABAP programs.

Notes

-   A splitter control can only be created in the alphanumeric Screen Painter by using Edit → Create Element → Splitter Control. For this reason it should only be used in cases when the functions offered are required on classic dynpros. Use [SAPUI5](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensapui5_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or [Web Dynpro ABAP](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenweb_dynpro_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") for new developments instead of classic dynpros.

-   Splitter controls offer certain advantages over the corresponding [CFW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencfw_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") containers. One advantage is that they allow all screen elements of a classic dynpro to be displayed directly in a flexible frame; another is that they have better performance than CFW controls. An example of intensive use of splitter controls is the flexible interface of ABAP Debugger.

CALL SUBSCREEN

Syntax

CALL SUBSCREEN sub\_area *\[*INCLUDING prog dynnr*\]*.

Variants:

[1\. CALL SUBSCREEN sub\_area INCLUDING prog dynnr.](#!ABAP_VARIANT_1@1@)
[2\. CALL SUBSCREEN sub\_area.](#!ABAP_VARIANT_2@2@)

Effect

Includes a [subscreen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensubscreen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in the [dynpro flow logic](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendynpro_flow_logic_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). There is one variant for event [PBO](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenpbo_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and one variant for event [PAI](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenpai_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The statement CALL SUBSCREEN cannot be used between the statements LOOP and ENDLOOP or CHAIN and ENDCHAIN.

Notes

-   The statement CALL SUBSCREEN is required for [directly including](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendynp_subscreen.htm) subscreens and for using [tabstrips](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendynp_tabstrip.htm) or [splitter controls](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendynp_splitter_control_spcl.htm) to include them.
    
-   An obsolete variant of this statement is [CALL CUSTOMER SUBSCREEN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/dynpcall_customer_subscreen.htm).
    

Variant 1

CALL SUBSCREEN sub\_area INCLUDING prog dynnr.

Effect

PBO

This statement is used to include the [subscreen dynpro](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensubscreen_dynpro_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the program defined in prog and the dynpro number defined in dynnr in the [subscreen area](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensubscreen_arrea_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") sub\_area of the current dynpro, and to process its PBO flow logic at this point. After PBO processing of the subscreen dynpro, the flow logic of the current dynpro is continued after the CALL statement.

The area sub\_area must be specified directly. prog expects either a two-character data object of the current ABAP program or a text field literal. dynnr expects a data object of the type n and length 4 from the current ABAP program or a text field literal. An exception that cannot be handled is raised if the specified subscreen dynpro cannot be found. If no subscreen dynpro is included for PBO in a subscreen area, the area remains empty.

If the specified subscreen dynpro is not defined in the current ABAP program, the specified program is loaded into the [internal session](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abeninternal_session_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and [LOAD-OF-PROGRAM](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapload-of-program.htm) is raised. If the object is a [function group](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenfunction_group_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), a new [additional program group](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenadditional_prog_group_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is created. If the object is an [executable program](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenexecutable_program_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or a [module pool](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenmodul_pool_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), the program is loaded to the [program group](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenprogram_group_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current program.

The flow logic of the subscreen dynpro calls the dialog modules of its own ABAP program and the global fields of its own program are transported to the subscreen dynpro . When a subscreen is being processed, sy-dynnr contains the dynpro number of the subscreen.

The GUI status and the current next dynpro cannot be changed in the dialog modules of the subscreen, and the statements SET *{* TITLEBAR *|* PF-STATUS *}* and *{* LEAVE *|* SET *}* SCREEN raise an exception there that cannot be handled.

Variant 2

CALL SUBSCREEN sub\_area.

Effect

PAI

The statement calls the PAI flow logic of the [subscreen dynpro](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensubscreen_dynpro_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") bound in the sub\_area [subscreen area](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensubscreen_arrea_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The subscreen dynpro must be included in the subscreen area for PBO (see variant 1). The same applies to the dialog modules called by the PAI flow logic as to the modules called by PBO. The data transport between the subscreen dynpro and its ABAP program is performed at the call, or is delayed when [FIELD](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/dynpfield.htm) statements are executed in the PAI flow logic of the subscreen logic.

Notes

-   If the use of subscreens means that the names of the displayed screen elements are not unique, multiple dynpro fields can be assigned to a global data object of the ABAP program, and, accordingly, multiple transports can be performed for PBO and PAI.
    
-   Since function codes from the subscreen dynpro are moved to the OK field of the including dynpro, it is advisable to give these function codes unique names.
    
-   Since the dynpro fields of subscreen dynpros are transported to the global data objects of the program in which the subscreen dynpros are defined, it must be ensured that the calling program is provided with this data when called externally. If reusable subscreen dynpros are to be defined, it is advisable to encapsulate them in function groups and to use function modules to enable the caller to set and use the global data.
    

Example

If a tabstrip control with untyped tabstrips and a subscreen area called SUB is defined on a dynpro, the associated dynpro flow logic can appear as follows. The statement CALL SUBSCREEN includes the subscreen dynpro of the same ABAP program whose number is in the ABAP data object dynnr in the subscreen area SUB. The associated programming section of the ABAP program is in the example for [CONTROLS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapcontrols_tabstrip.htm).

PROCESS BEFORE OUTPUT.
  MODULE prepare\_tabstrip.
  CALL SUBSCREEN sub INCLUDING sy-repid dynnr.
PROCESS AFTER INPUT.
  CALL SUBSCREEN sub.
  MODULE handle\_user\_command.

Description

The static next dynpro number of dynpro 100 is 100. Four pushbuttons with function codes "SUB1" to "SUB4" and two identically sized subscreen areas area1 and area2 have been created. In the same ABAP program, four subscreen dynpros 110 to 140 are defined. The input/output field of all four subscreen dynpro has the name field. The function codes of the pushbuttons on the subscreen dynpros 110 and 130 are OK1 and OK2. The screen flow logic for dynpro 100 is as follows:

PROCESS BEFORE OUTPUT.
  MODULE status\_100.
  CALL SUBSCREEN: area1 INCLUDING sy-repid number1,
                  area2 INCLUDING sy-repid number2.
PROCESS AFTER INPUT.
  MODULE cancel AT EXIT-COMMAND.
  MODULE save\_ok.
  CALL SUBSCREEN: area1,
                  area2.
  MODULE user\_command\_100.

The screen flow logic of subscreen dynpros 110 and 130 is:

PROCESS BEFORE OUTPUT.
  MODULE fill\_0110*|*0130.
PROCESS AFTER INPUT.
  MODULE user\_command\_0110*|*0130.

The screen flow logic of subscreen dynpros 120 and 140 is:

PROCESS BEFORE OUTPUT.
  MODULE fill\_0120*|*0150.
PROCESS AFTER INPUT.

When the program is executed, a screen appears on which subscreens 110 and 130 are displayed. The pushbuttons on the main dynpro allow the user to choose between two subscreen dynpros for each screen area. The pushbuttons on the subscreen dynpros 110 and 130 allow data to be passed to the subscreen dynpros 120 and 140.

Since all subscreen dynpros use the same field name field, the ABAP field with the same name is transported more than once at each PBO and PAI of the main dynpro. In the ABAP program, the values must therefore be cached in the helper fields field1 and field2.

The function code of the pushbuttons of the subscreen dynpros is different and regular handling in an ABAP field is enough. If the function codes had the same names, it would be necessary to use multiple helper fields here as well.

Description

The static subsequent screen number of screen 100 is 100. It is a tabstrip page called mytabstrip created with three tabs, PUSH1, PUSH2, PUSH3 and function codes with the same names (type p). One of three identically sized subscreen areas, sub1 to sub3, is assigned to each tab. The button is called BUTTON and has the function code 'OK'. In addition three subscreens, 110 to 130, are defined. These subscreens fit into the above mentioned subscreen areas. The screen flow logic of the subscreens 110 to 130 does not contain any module calls.

When the program is executed, the user sees a screen, the second tab page of which is active because before screen 100 is called, the component activetab of the structure mytabstrip is set to PUSH2. The user can scroll between the tab pages without triggering the PAI event. Each tab page has one of the three subscreens attached to it.

By selecting the Continue button, the PAI event is triggered and a message shows the function code of the tab assigned to the currently active tab page.

The layout of dynpro 100 and the subscreen dynpros 110 to 130 is the same as in the [executable example](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentab_strip_control1_abexa.htm) with local scrolling. The function codes of the three tab titles are not typed and a common subscreen area sub is assigned to all tab titles.

The screen flow logic of dynpro 100 makes a dynamic binding to PBO, a subscreen dynpro in the subscreen area sub. The screen flow logic of subscreen dynpros 110 to 130 does not contain any module calls.

This example works in exactly the same way as the [example with local scrolling](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentab_strip_control1_abexa.htm) except that scrolling between the tabstrip pages is programmed in the ABAP program. Every time a tab title is selected, it is assigned the function code of the OK field in the activetab component of the mytabstrip structure. At the same time, the variable number is given the dynpro number of the subscreen dynpro to be displayed in the subscreen area SUB of the tabstrip.

Subscreens, Tabstrips, and Splitter Controls

Subscreens are screens of special subscreen dynpros that can be included in other dynpros. Subscreens are either included directly, or using special [controls](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencontrol_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Including Subscreens Directly

The statement [CALL SUBSCREEN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/dynpcall.htm) can be used to insert other screens directly into the [screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenscreen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of a [dynpro](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendynpro_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in the form of subscreens. Subscreen areas must first be defined in the current screen of the dynpro. Every subscreen area has a unique name and can be configured to support changes in screen size. If the latter is defined, each size change in the current GUI window triggers the [PAI](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenpai_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") event.

Subscreens are the screens of special [subscreen dynpros](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensubscreen_dynpro_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). When a subscreen is inserted, the flow logic of the subscreen dynpro is also inserted. Subscreens can also insert other subscreens. Subscreens cannot have their own OK field. Instead, user actions on subscreens pass the function codes to the OK field of the dynpro that includes the subscreen. In the PAI event block of a subscreen dynpro, a [MODULE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/dynpmodule.htm) statement is never executed with the AT EXIT-COMMAND addition.

Note

Subscreens dynpros are defined like normal dynpros in [Screen Painter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenscreen_painter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and are flagged there as regular dynpros. [Selection screens](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselection-screen_subscreen.htm) can also be defined as subscreens.

Tabstrip Controls

A tabstrip control is a screen element that is made up of multiple tab pages. Every tab page contains a one line [tab title](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentab_title_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") associated with a function code and which can be used to select the tab page by clicking once. Under the tab title, a tab page is made up of a subscreen area. Each tab title must have a subscreen area assigned to it, in which any subscreens can be displayed. There are two ways to do this:

-   Browsing in SAP GUI
    A separate subscreen area is assigned to each tab title, and the function codes of the tab titles are defined with function type "P". If the user selects a tab title, the event PAI is not triggered. The associated subscreens are included once in each individual subscreen area by using the [CALL SUBSCREEN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/dynpcall.htm) statement of the flow logic. If the user selects a tab title, the SAP GUI browses to the associated tab page and displays its subscreen.

-   Browsing in ABAP Programs
    The same subscreen area is assigned to each tab title, and the function codes of the tab titles are defined without [typing](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentyping_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). If the user selects a tab title, the event PAI is triggered. The associated subscreen is included dynamically using the [CALL SUBSCREEN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/dynpcall.htm) statement of the flow logic in the subscreen area each time the user browses. In the ABAP program, the associated tab page must be activated using [CONTROLS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapcontrols.htm) and the correct subscreen dynpro for the subscreen area must be specified.

Note

If a tab title entry is selected when browsing in SAP GUI, input checks are not made and data is not transported to the ABAP program. Only if a user action triggers the PAI event are all the entries checked and the data of all screens transported. When browsing in the ABAP program, the input is checked each time a tab title is selected and the current tab page data is transported to the ABAP program of the subscreen dynpro.

Splitter Controls

A splitter control is a screen element that divides the area it covers into two [subscreen areas](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensubscreen_arrea_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), either horizontally beside each other or vertically one above the other. The division is made by a sash. The horizontal or vertical position of the sash is specified statically in the definition of the splitter control. It can be set to PBO in the ABAP program and changed by the user while the screen is being displayed.

Inserting [subscreen dynpros](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensubscreen_dynpro_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") into both subscreen areas takes place in exactly the same way as [direct insertion](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendynp_subscreen.htm) using the [CALL SUBSCREEN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/dynpcall.htm) statement in the dynpro flow logic. Any subscreens can be inserted, particularly those that contain splitter controls again.

In ABAP programs, the position of the sash of a splitter controls is controlled using an instance of the CL\_DYNPRO\_SPLITTER class. If, before sending this screen, an object of this class is created and its constructor is given the name of a splitter control, this is bound to the splitter control and its methods can be used to set and read the position of the sash. The sash position is specified by percentage and refers to the width or height of the splitter control. In the object, the position is represented by a private attribute. Important methods of the class are:

-   GET\_GUISASH
    At PAI sets the sash position of the object to the current value of the bound splitter control.

-   SET\_SASH
    If no value is passed to the POSITION parameter, the method sets the sash position of the bound splitter control at PBO to the value of the object. If a value is passed to the POSITION parameter, the method sets the attribute of the object and the sash position of the bound splitter control at PBO to this value. At PAI, only the attribute of the object is set.

-   GET\_SASH
    Gets the sash position of the bound splitter control at PBO and PAI.

A splitter control can have a [function code](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenfunction_code_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") assigned to it, which can be used to react to changes to the sash position made by the user in ABAP programs.

Notes

-   A splitter control can only be created in the alphanumeric Screen Painter by using Edit → Create Element → Splitter Control. For this reason it should only be used in cases when the functions offered are required on classic dynpros. Use [SAPUI5](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensapui5_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or [Web Dynpro ABAP](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenweb_dynpro_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") for new developments instead of classic dynpros.

-   Splitter controls offer certain advantages over the corresponding [CFW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencfw_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") containers. One advantage is that they allow all screen elements of a classic dynpro to be displayed directly in a flexible frame; another is that they have better performance than CFW controls. An example of intensive use of splitter controls is the flexible interface of ABAP Debugger.

This statement is used to include the [subscreen dynpro](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensubscreen_dynpro_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the program defined in prog and the dynpro number defined in dynnr in the [subscreen area](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensubscreen_arrea_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") sub\_area of the current dynpro, and to process its PBO flow logic at this point. After PBO processing of the subscreen dynpro, the flow logic of the current dynpro is continued after the CALL statement.

The area sub\_area must be specified directly. prog expects either a two-character data object of the current ABAP program or a text field literal. dynnr expects a data object of the type n and length 4 from the current ABAP program or a text field literal. An exception that cannot be handled is raised if the specified subscreen dynpro cannot be found. If no subscreen dynpro is included for PBO in a subscreen area, the area remains empty.

If the specified subscreen dynpro is not defined in the current ABAP program, the specified program is loaded into the [internal session](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abeninternal_session_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and [LOAD-OF-PROGRAM](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapload-of-program.htm) is raised. If the object is a [function group](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenfunction_group_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), a new [additional program group](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenadditional_prog_group_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is created. If the object is an [executable program](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenexecutable_program_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or a [module pool](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenmodul_pool_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), the program is loaded to the [program group](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenprogram_group_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current program.

The flow logic of the subscreen dynpro calls the dialog modules of its own ABAP program and the global fields of its own program are transported to the subscreen dynpro . When a subscreen is being processed, sy-dynnr contains the dynpro number of the subscreen.

The GUI status and the current next dynpro cannot be changed in the dialog modules of the subscreen, and the statements SET *{* TITLEBAR *|* PF-STATUS *}* and *{* LEAVE *|* SET *}* SCREEN raise an exception there that cannot be handled.

Variant 2

CALL SUBSCREEN sub\_area.

Effect

PAI

The statement calls the PAI flow logic of the [subscreen dynpro](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensubscreen_dynpro_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") bound in the sub\_area [subscreen area](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensubscreen_arrea_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The subscreen dynpro must be included in the subscreen area for PBO (see variant 1). The same applies to the dialog modules called by the PAI flow logic as to the modules called by PBO. The data transport between the subscreen dynpro and its ABAP program is performed at the call, or is delayed when [FIELD](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/dynpfield.htm) statements are executed in the PAI flow logic of the subscreen logic.

Notes

-   If the use of subscreens means that the names of the displayed screen elements are not unique, multiple dynpro fields can be assigned to a global data object of the ABAP program, and, accordingly, multiple transports can be performed for PBO and PAI.
    
-   Since function codes from the subscreen dynpro are moved to the OK field of the including dynpro, it is advisable to give these function codes unique names.
    
-   Since the dynpro fields of subscreen dynpros are transported to the global data objects of the program in which the subscreen dynpros are defined, it must be ensured that the calling program is provided with this data when called externally. If reusable subscreen dynpros are to be defined, it is advisable to encapsulate them in function groups and to use function modules to enable the caller to set and use the global data.
    

Example

If a tabstrip control with untyped tabstrips and a subscreen area called SUB is defined on a dynpro, the associated dynpro flow logic can appear as follows. The statement CALL SUBSCREEN includes the subscreen dynpro of the same ABAP program whose number is in the ABAP data object dynnr in the subscreen area SUB. The associated programming section of the ABAP program is in the example for [CONTROLS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapcontrols_tabstrip.htm).

PROCESS BEFORE OUTPUT.
  MODULE prepare\_tabstrip.
  CALL SUBSCREEN sub INCLUDING sy-repid dynnr.
PROCESS AFTER INPUT.
  CALL SUBSCREEN sub.
  MODULE handle\_user\_command.

Description

The static next dynpro number of dynpro 100 is 100. Four pushbuttons with function codes "SUB1" to "SUB4" and two identically sized subscreen areas area1 and area2 have been created. In the same ABAP program, four subscreen dynpros 110 to 140 are defined. The input/output field of all four subscreen dynpro has the name field. The function codes of the pushbuttons on the subscreen dynpros 110 and 130 are OK1 and OK2. The screen flow logic for dynpro 100 is as follows:

PROCESS BEFORE OUTPUT.
  MODULE status\_100.
  CALL SUBSCREEN: area1 INCLUDING sy-repid number1,
                  area2 INCLUDING sy-repid number2.
PROCESS AFTER INPUT.
  MODULE cancel AT EXIT-COMMAND.
  MODULE save\_ok.
  CALL SUBSCREEN: area1,
                  area2.
  MODULE user\_command\_100.

The screen flow logic of subscreen dynpros 110 and 130 is:

PROCESS BEFORE OUTPUT.
  MODULE fill\_0110*|*0130.
PROCESS AFTER INPUT.
  MODULE user\_command\_0110*|*0130.

The screen flow logic of subscreen dynpros 120 and 140 is:

PROCESS BEFORE OUTPUT.
  MODULE fill\_0120*|*0150.
PROCESS AFTER INPUT.

When the program is executed, a screen appears on which subscreens 110 and 130 are displayed. The pushbuttons on the main dynpro allow the user to choose between two subscreen dynpros for each screen area. The pushbuttons on the subscreen dynpros 110 and 130 allow data to be passed to the subscreen dynpros 120 and 140.

Since all subscreen dynpros use the same field name field, the ABAP field with the same name is transported more than once at each PBO and PAI of the main dynpro. In the ABAP program, the values must therefore be cached in the helper fields field1 and field2.

The function code of the pushbuttons of the subscreen dynpros is different and regular handling in an ABAP field is enough. If the function codes had the same names, it would be necessary to use multiple helper fields here as well.

Description

The static subsequent screen number of screen 100 is 100. It is a tabstrip page called mytabstrip created with three tabs, PUSH1, PUSH2, PUSH3 and function codes with the same names (type p). One of three identically sized subscreen areas, sub1 to sub3, is assigned to each tab. The button is called BUTTON and has the function code 'OK'. In addition three subscreens, 110 to 130, are defined. These subscreens fit into the above mentioned subscreen areas. The screen flow logic of the subscreens 110 to 130 does not contain any module calls.

When the program is executed, the user sees a screen, the second tab page of which is active because before screen 100 is called, the component activetab of the structure mytabstrip is set to PUSH2. The user can scroll between the tab pages without triggering the PAI event. Each tab page has one of the three subscreens attached to it.

By selecting the Continue button, the PAI event is triggered and a message shows the function code of the tab assigned to the currently active tab page.

Description

The static next dynpro number of dynpro 100 is 100. The layout of dynpro 100 and the subscreen dynpros 110 to 130 is the same as in the [executable example](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentab_strip_control1_abexa.htm) with local scrolling. The function codes of the three tab titles are not typed and a common subscreen area sub is assigned to all tab titles.

The screen flow logic of dynpro 100 makes a dynamic binding to PBO, a subscreen dynpro in the subscreen area sub. The screen flow logic of subscreen dynpros 110 to 130 does not contain any module calls.

This example works in exactly the same way as the [example with local scrolling](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentab_strip_control1_abexa.htm) except that scrolling between the tabstrip pages is programmed in the ABAP program. Every time a tab title is selected, it is assigned the function code of the OK field in the activetab component of the mytabstrip structure. At the same time, the variable number is given the dynpro number of the subscreen dynpro to be displayed in the subscreen area SUB of the tabstrip.

Subscreens, Tabstrips, and Splitter Controls

Subscreens are screens of special subscreen dynpros that can be included in other dynpros. Subscreens are either included directly, or using special [controls](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencontrol_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

[ABAP - Keyword Documentation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenabap.htm) →  [ABAP - Reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenabap_reference.htm) →  [SAP GUI User Dialogs](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenabap_screens.htm) →  [Dynpros](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenabap_dynpros.htm) →  [Statements in the Screen Flow Logic](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenabap_dynpros_dynpro_statements.htm) →  [Subscreens, Tabstrips, and Splitter Controls](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendynp_subscreens.htm) → 

Including Subscreens Directly

The statement [CALL SUBSCREEN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/dynpcall.htm) can be used to insert other screens directly into the [screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenscreen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of a [dynpro](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendynpro_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in the form of subscreens. Subscreen areas must first be defined in the current screen of the dynpro. Every subscreen area has a unique name and can be configured to support changes in screen size. If the latter is defined, each size change in the current GUI window triggers the [PAI](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenpai_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") event.

Subscreens are the screens of special [subscreen dynpros](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensubscreen_dynpro_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). When a subscreen is inserted, the flow logic of the subscreen dynpro is also inserted. Subscreens can also insert other subscreens. Subscreens cannot have their own OK field. Instead, user actions on subscreens pass the function codes to the OK field of the dynpro that includes the subscreen. In the PAI event block of a subscreen dynpro, a [MODULE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/dynpmodule.htm) statement is never executed with the AT EXIT-COMMAND addition.

Note

Subscreens dynpros are defined like normal dynpros in [Screen Painter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenscreen_painter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and are flagged there as regular dynpros. [Selection screens](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselection-screen_subscreen.htm) can also be defined as subscreens.

Tabstrip Controls

A tabstrip control is a screen element that is made up of multiple tab pages. Every tab page contains a one line [tab title](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentab_title_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") associated with a function code and which can be used to select the tab page by clicking once. Under the tab title, a tab page is made up of a subscreen area. Each tab title must have a subscreen area assigned to it, in which any subscreens can be displayed. There are two ways to do this:

-   Browsing in SAP GUI
    A separate subscreen area is assigned to each tab title, and the function codes of the tab titles are defined with function type "P". If the user selects a tab title, the event PAI is not triggered. The associated subscreens are included once in each individual subscreen area by using the [CALL SUBSCREEN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/dynpcall.htm) statement of the flow logic. If the user selects a tab title, the SAP GUI browses to the associated tab page and displays its subscreen.

-   Browsing in ABAP Programs
    The same subscreen area is assigned to each tab title, and the function codes of the tab titles are defined without [typing](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentyping_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). If the user selects a tab title, the event PAI is triggered. The associated subscreen is included dynamically using the [CALL SUBSCREEN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/dynpcall.htm) statement of the flow logic in the subscreen area each time the user browses. In the ABAP program, the associated tab page must be activated using [CONTROLS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapcontrols.htm) and the correct subscreen dynpro for the subscreen area must be specified.

Note

If a tab title entry is selected when browsing in SAP GUI, input checks are not made and data is not transported to the ABAP program. Only if a user action triggers the PAI event are all the entries checked and the data of all screens transported. When browsing in the ABAP program, the input is checked each time a tab title is selected and the current tab page data is transported to the ABAP program of the subscreen dynpro.

Splitter Controls

A splitter control is a screen element that divides the area it covers into two [subscreen areas](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensubscreen_arrea_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), either horizontally beside each other or vertically one above the other. The division is made by a sash. The horizontal or vertical position of the sash is specified statically in the definition of the splitter control. It can be set to PBO in the ABAP program and changed by the user while the screen is being displayed.

Inserting [subscreen dynpros](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensubscreen_dynpro_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") into both subscreen areas takes place in exactly the same way as [direct insertion](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendynp_subscreen.htm) using the [CALL SUBSCREEN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/dynpcall.htm) statement in the dynpro flow logic. Any subscreens can be inserted, particularly those that contain splitter controls again.

In ABAP programs, the position of the sash of a splitter controls is controlled using an instance of the CL\_DYNPRO\_SPLITTER class. If, before sending this screen, an object of this class is created and its constructor is given the name of a splitter control, this is bound to the splitter control and its methods can be used to set and read the position of the sash. The sash position is specified by percentage and refers to the width or height of the splitter control. In the object, the position is represented by a private attribute. Important methods of the class are:

-   GET\_GUISASH
    At PAI sets the sash position of the object to the current value of the bound splitter control.

-   SET\_SASH
    If no value is passed to the POSITION parameter, the method sets the sash position of the bound splitter control at PBO to the value of the object. If a value is passed to the POSITION parameter, the method sets the attribute of the object and the sash position of the bound splitter control at PBO to this value. At PAI, only the attribute of the object is set.

-   GET\_SASH
    Gets the sash position of the bound splitter control at PBO and PAI.

A splitter control can have a [function code](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenfunction_code_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") assigned to it, which can be used to react to changes to the sash position made by the user in ABAP programs.

Notes

-   A splitter control can only be created in the alphanumeric Screen Painter by using Edit → Create Element → Splitter Control. For this reason it should only be used in cases when the functions offered are required on classic dynpros. Use [SAPUI5](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensapui5_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or [Web Dynpro ABAP](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenweb_dynpro_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") for new developments instead of classic dynpros.

-   Splitter controls offer certain advantages over the corresponding [CFW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencfw_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") containers. One advantage is that they allow all screen elements of a classic dynpro to be displayed directly in a flexible frame; another is that they have better performance than CFW controls. An example of intensive use of splitter controls is the flexible interface of ABAP Debugger.

CALL SUBSCREEN

Syntax

CALL SUBSCREEN sub\_area *\[*INCLUDING prog dynnr*\]*.

Variants:

[1\. CALL SUBSCREEN sub\_area INCLUDING prog dynnr.](#!ABAP_VARIANT_1@1@)
[2\. CALL SUBSCREEN sub\_area.](#!ABAP_VARIANT_2@2@)

Effect

Includes a [subscreen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensubscreen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in the [dynpro flow logic](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendynpro_flow_logic_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). There is one variant for event [PBO](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenpbo_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and one variant for event [PAI](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenpai_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The statement CALL SUBSCREEN cannot be used between the statements LOOP and ENDLOOP or CHAIN and ENDCHAIN.

Notes

-   The statement CALL SUBSCREEN is required for [directly including](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendynp_subscreen.htm) subscreens and for using [tabstrips](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendynp_tabstrip.htm) or [splitter controls](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendynp_splitter_control_spcl.htm) to include them.
    
-   An obsolete variant of this statement is [CALL CUSTOMER SUBSCREEN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/dynpcall_customer_subscreen.htm).
    

Variant 1

CALL SUBSCREEN sub\_area INCLUDING prog dynnr.

Effect

PBO

This statement is used to include the [subscreen dynpro](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensubscreen_dynpro_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the program defined in prog and the dynpro number defined in dynnr in the [subscreen area](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensubscreen_arrea_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") sub\_area of the current dynpro, and to process its PBO flow logic at this point. After PBO processing of the subscreen dynpro, the flow logic of the current dynpro is continued after the CALL statement.

The area sub\_area must be specified directly. prog expects either a two-character data object of the current ABAP program or a text field literal. dynnr expects a data object of the type n and length 4 from the current ABAP program or a text field literal. An exception that cannot be handled is raised if the specified subscreen dynpro cannot be found. If no subscreen dynpro is included for PBO in a subscreen area, the area remains empty.

If the specified subscreen dynpro is not defined in the current ABAP program, the specified program is loaded into the [internal session](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abeninternal_session_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and [LOAD-OF-PROGRAM](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapload-of-program.htm) is raised. If the object is a [function group](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenfunction_group_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), a new [additional program group](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenadditional_prog_group_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is created. If the object is an [executable program](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenexecutable_program_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or a [module pool](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenmodul_pool_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), the program is loaded to the [program group](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenprogram_group_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current program.

The flow logic of the subscreen dynpro calls the dialog modules of its own ABAP program and the global fields of its own program are transported to the subscreen dynpro . When a subscreen is being processed, sy-dynnr contains the dynpro number of the subscreen.

The GUI status and the current next dynpro cannot be changed in the dialog modules of the subscreen, and the statements SET *{* TITLEBAR *|* PF-STATUS *}* and *{* LEAVE *|* SET *}* SCREEN raise an exception there that cannot be handled.

Variant 2

CALL SUBSCREEN sub\_area.

Effect

PAI

The statement calls the PAI flow logic of the [subscreen dynpro](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensubscreen_dynpro_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") bound in the sub\_area [subscreen area](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensubscreen_arrea_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The subscreen dynpro must be included in the subscreen area for PBO (see variant 1). The same applies to the dialog modules called by the PAI flow logic as to the modules called by PBO. The data transport between the subscreen dynpro and its ABAP program is performed at the call, or is delayed when [FIELD](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/dynpfield.htm) statements are executed in the PAI flow logic of the subscreen logic.

Notes

-   If the use of subscreens means that the names of the displayed screen elements are not unique, multiple dynpro fields can be assigned to a global data object of the ABAP program, and, accordingly, multiple transports can be performed for PBO and PAI.
    
-   Since function codes from the subscreen dynpro are moved to the OK field of the including dynpro, it is advisable to give these function codes unique names.
    
-   Since the dynpro fields of subscreen dynpros are transported to the global data objects of the program in which the subscreen dynpros are defined, it must be ensured that the calling program is provided with this data when called externally. If reusable subscreen dynpros are to be defined, it is advisable to encapsulate them in function groups and to use function modules to enable the caller to set and use the global data.
    

Example

If a tabstrip control with untyped tabstrips and a subscreen area called SUB is defined on a dynpro, the associated dynpro flow logic can appear as follows. The statement CALL SUBSCREEN includes the subscreen dynpro of the same ABAP program whose number is in the ABAP data object dynnr in the subscreen area SUB. The associated programming section of the ABAP program is in the example for [CONTROLS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapcontrols_tabstrip.htm).

PROCESS BEFORE OUTPUT.
  MODULE prepare\_tabstrip.
  CALL SUBSCREEN sub INCLUDING sy-repid dynnr.
PROCESS AFTER INPUT.
  CALL SUBSCREEN sub.
  MODULE handle\_user\_command.

Description

The static next dynpro number of dynpro 100 is 100. Four pushbuttons with function codes "SUB1" to "SUB4" and two identically sized subscreen areas area1 and area2 have been created. In the same ABAP program, four subscreen dynpros 110 to 140 are defined. The input/output field of all four subscreen dynpro has the name field. The function codes of the pushbuttons on the subscreen dynpros 110 and 130 are OK1 and OK2. The screen flow logic for dynpro 100 is as follows:

PROCESS BEFORE OUTPUT.
  MODULE status\_100.
  CALL SUBSCREEN: area1 INCLUDING sy-repid number1,
                  area2 INCLUDING sy-repid number2.
PROCESS AFTER INPUT.
  MODULE cancel AT EXIT-COMMAND.
  MODULE save\_ok.
  CALL SUBSCREEN: area1,
                  area2.
  MODULE user\_command\_100.

The screen flow logic of subscreen dynpros 110 and 130 is:

PROCESS BEFORE OUTPUT.
  MODULE fill\_0110*|*0130.
PROCESS AFTER INPUT.
  MODULE user\_command\_0110*|*0130.

The screen flow logic of subscreen dynpros 120 and 140 is:

PROCESS BEFORE OUTPUT.
  MODULE fill\_0120*|*0150.
PROCESS AFTER INPUT.

When the program is executed, a screen appears on which subscreens 110 and 130 are displayed. The pushbuttons on the main dynpro allow the user to choose between two subscreen dynpros for each screen area. The pushbuttons on the subscreen dynpros 110 and 130 allow data to be passed to the subscreen dynpros 120 and 140.

Since all subscreen dynpros use the same field name field, the ABAP field with the same name is transported more than once at each PBO and PAI of the main dynpro. In the ABAP program, the values must therefore be cached in the helper fields field1 and field2.

The function code of the pushbuttons of the subscreen dynpros is different and regular handling in an ABAP field is enough. If the function codes had the same names, it would be necessary to use multiple helper fields here as well.

Description

The static subsequent screen number of screen 100 is 100. It is a tabstrip page called mytabstrip created with three tabs, PUSH1, PUSH2, PUSH3 and function codes with the same names (type p). One of three identically sized subscreen areas, sub1 to sub3, is assigned to each tab. The button is called BUTTON and has the function code 'OK'. In addition three subscreens, 110 to 130, are defined. These subscreens fit into the above mentioned subscreen areas. The screen flow logic of the subscreens 110 to 130 does not contain any module calls.

When the program is executed, the user sees a screen, the second tab page of which is active because before screen 100 is called, the component activetab of the structure mytabstrip is set to PUSH2. The user can scroll between the tab pages without triggering the PAI event. Each tab page has one of the three subscreens attached to it.

By selecting the Continue button, the PAI event is triggered and a message shows the function code of the tab assigned to the currently active tab page.

Description

The static next dynpro number of dynpro 100 is 100. The layout of dynpro 100 and the subscreen dynpros 110 to 130 is the same as in the [executable example](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentab_strip_control1_abexa.htm) with local scrolling. The function codes of the three tab titles are not typed and a common subscreen area sub is assigned to all tab titles.

The screen flow logic of dynpro 100 makes a dynamic binding to PBO, a subscreen dynpro in the subscreen area sub. The screen flow logic of subscreen dynpros 110 to 130 does not contain any module calls.

This example works in exactly the same way as the [example with local scrolling](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentab_strip_control1_abexa.htm) except that scrolling between the tabstrip pages is programmed in the ABAP program. Every time a tab title is selected, it is assigned the function code of the OK field in the activetab component of the mytabstrip structure. At the same time, the variable number is given the dynpro number of the subscreen dynpro to be displayed in the subscreen area SUB of the tabstrip.

LOOP AT SCREEN

[Quick Reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abaploop_at_screen_shortref.htm)

Syntax

LOOP AT SCREEN INTO wa.
  ...
ENDLOOP.

Effect

The statements LOOP AT SCREEN ... ENDLOOP define a loop around a statement block. For every screen element of the current dynpro to which a [dynpro field](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendynpro_field_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is assigned, one loop pass is executed. wa can be specified as:

-   an existing work area of the data type [SCREEN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenscreen.htm) from ABAP Dictionary,
    
-   an inline declaration [DATA(var)](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendata_inline.htm), where a work area of the type SCREEN is declared.
    

After the statement LOOP, the work area contains the properties of the screen element in question.

When a [table control](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentable_control_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or a [step loop](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenstep_loop_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is processed (that is, within a [LOOP](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/dynploop.htm) of the [dynpro flow logic](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendynpro_flow_logic_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")), the current properties are determined for its screen elements in the current row or group. Outside of the processing of a table control or step loop, the statically predefined properties of all rows or groups are determined for its screen elements.

Notes

-   The statement LOOP AT SCREEN behaves like the statement [LOOP](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abaploop_at_itab.htm) in a loop across an internal table, where a system table is used instead of an internal table.
    
-   In particular, the statement LOOP AT SCREEN can be used for selection screens during [selection screen processing](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_screen_events.htm).
    
-   This statement also has an [obsolete short form](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenloop_at_screen_obsolete.htm), which works with an obsolete built-in structure [screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenscreen_structure_obsolete.htm).
    
-   The obsolete built-in structure [screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenscreen_structure_obsolete.htm) should not be specified explicitly after INTO.

The Structure SCREEN

Most components of the structure SCREEN from ABAP Dictionary correspond to the attributes of a screen element on a dynpro.

Data objects with the data type SCREEN can be used as a work area in the following ABAP statements:

-   in [LOOP AT SCREEN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abaploop_at_screen.htm), to read the screen element properties of a dynpro,

-   in [MODIFY SCREEN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapmodify_screen.htm), to modify the screen element properties of a dynpro.

The following table shows the components of SCREEN, their assignment to the field properties in the dynpro, and the possible values.

The component name contains the name name of the current dynpro field in the loop. The components group1 to group4 can contain three figure identifiers id1 to id4, which were assigned to the current screen element when it was defined. These identifiers allow the screen elements to be grouped together in up to four different [modification groups](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenmodification_group_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). These can be queried in logical expressions in the statement block after [LOOP AT SCREEN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abaploop_at_screen.htm) to process multiple screen elements in the same way.

The remaining components of the structure SCREEN (apart from request) show the display properties of the current screen element. With the exception of length, they can have the value 0 or 1, where content 1 means "active" and content 0 means "inactive". In addition, required and value\_help can also have the value 2:

-   With required, value 2 means a recommended field which is displayed on the screen in the same way as a mandatory field (value 1) but a check is not performed.

-   With value\_help, value 2 means that the input help button is always displayed, whereas value 1 means that the button is only displayed if the cursor is positioned on the dynpro field.

Except for active and request, all components of the structure SCREEN correspond directly to an attribute of the current screen element.

-   The component active does not have a corresponding attribute. A change to its content using [MODIFY SCREEN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapmodify_screen.htm) influences the attributes input, output and invisible, and correspondingly the components input, output and invisible of the structure SCREEN.

-   The component request has the following meaning:

-   It is set to the value 1 by the runtime environment if the event PAI occurs, provided that user input exists has been entered in the dynpro field.

-   Using [MODIFY SCREEN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapmodify_screen.htm), its content can be set to the value 1 at PBO time to simulate user input.

If the component request has the value 1 for a dynpro field at PAI time, those dialog modules are executed that are called for this field using the additions ON REQUEST and ON CHAIN-REQUEST after the dynpro statement [FIELD](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/dynpfield_module.htm).

MODIFY SCREEN

[Quick Reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapmodify_screen_shortref.htm)

Syntax

MODIFY SCREEN FROM wa.

Effect

This statement can be used in the statement block after [LOOP AT SCREEN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abaploop_at_screen.htm) only and makes sense only during [PBO](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenpbo_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") processing. A work area wa of the type [SCREEN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenscreen.htm) from ABAP Dictionary must be specified after FROM. The statement modifies the attributes of the current screen element with the values from the work area.

The name component must contain the name of the current screen element, otherwise the statement is not executed. Apart from the components group1 through group4 and length, all other components of wa have either the value 0 or 1. The value 0 deactivates the corresponding field property; the value 1 activates it. In addition, [required](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenscreen.htm) and [value\_help](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenscreen.htm) can also have the value 2:

If MODIFY SCREEN is executed during PBO processing, the modified attributes for the display of the [screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenscreen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") affect the current [dynpro](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendynpro_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") after PBO processing. The attributes of the screen elements of the dynpro are reset to their static attributes at the start of each PBO processing, so that the execution of MODIFY SCREEN during [PAI](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenpai_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") processing does not affect the display of the following screen.

The active component

The active component is used to set the input, output, and invisible components at the same time. When PBO processing starts, the component active is always 1. If active is set to 0 by MODIFY SCREEN, input and output are set to 0 and invisible is set to 1. Any other values in input, output, and invisible are ignored. Conversely, setting input and output to 0 and invisible to 1 automatically sets active to 0 and any other values in active are ignored.

Special Cases

The following special cases should be noted:

-   If the current dynpro field with the property output field only is defined in Screen Painter, it cannot be set to ready for input and the assignment of the value 1 to the component input is ignored.
    
-   If the current dynpro field with the property required is defined in Screen Painter or if the component required is set to 1, the component input should stay as 1. Otherwise, setting input to 0 would cancel the required property.
    

Modifications in Table Controls and Step Loops

When processing a [table control](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentable_control_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or a [step loop](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenstep_loop_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), the changes affect the current row of the table control or the current step loop group. Before the processing of a table control, the change to the attributes of a screen element that is part of a row in the table control does not affect the table control, since the values are passed from the structure created using [CONTROLS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapcontrols.htm). Before a step loop is processed, the change to the attributes of a screen elements that is part of a step loop group affects all groups in the step loop.

Modifications to Tabstrip Controls

If the active component for a [tab title](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentab_title_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of a [tabstrip control](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentabstrip_control_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is set to 0, the whole tabstrip page is hidden.

Notes

-   More specifically, the statement MODIFY SCREEN can be used for selection screens during the selection screen event [AT SELECTION-SCREEN OUTPUT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapat_selection-screen_events.htm) in [selection screen processing](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_screen_events.htm).
    
-   This statement has an [obsolete short form](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenmodify_screen_obsolete.htm) that works with the obsolete built-in structure [screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenscreen_structure_obsolete.htm).
    
-   The obsolete built-in structure [screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenscreen_structure_obsolete.htm) should not be specified explicitly after FROM.
    

Example

In the following PBO module, an input field called val is made mandatory and converted to display in the foreground.

MODULE modify\_0100 OUTPUT.
  LOOP AT SCREEN INTO DATA(screen\_wa).
    IF screen\_wa-name = 'VAL'.
      screen\_wa-required    = '1'.
      screen\_wa-intensified = '1'.
      MODIFY SCREEN FROM screen\_wa.
    ENDIF.
  ENDLOOP.
ENDMODULE.

Executable Example

The program DEMO\_DYNPRO\_MODIFY\_SCREEN demonstrates all possible dynamic screen modifications.

Screens, Dynamic Screen Modification

The example shows how to modify screen fields at runtime.

Source Code

REPORT demo\_dynpro\_modify\_simple .
DATA: ok\_code TYPE sy-ucomm,
      save\_ok TYPE sy-ucomm.
DATA flag(1) TYPE c.
CALL SCREEN 100.
MODULE status\_0100 OUTPUT.
  SET PF-STATUS 'SCREEN\_100'.
  LOOP AT SCREEN INTO DATA(screen\_wa).
    IF screen\_wa-group1 = 'MOD'.
      IF flag = ' '.
        screen\_wa-input = '0'.
      ELSEIF flag = 'X'.
        screen\_wa-input = '1'.
      ENDIF.
      MODIFY SCREEN FROM screen\_wa.
    ENDIF.
  ENDLOOP.
ENDMODULE.
MODULE cancel.
  LEAVE PROGRAM.
ENDMODULE.
MODULE user\_command\_0100 INPUT.
  save\_ok = ok\_code.
  CLEAR ok\_code.
  CASE save\_ok.
    WHEN 'TOGGLE'.
      IF flag = ' '.
        flag = 'X'.
      ELSEIF flag = 'X'.
        flag = ' '.
      ENDIF.
  ENDCASE.
ENDMODULE.

Description

The static next screen number of screen 100 is 100. The input and output fields have been copied from the structure DEMO\_CONN of the ABAP Dictionary. The bottom-most four input and output fields are assigned to the modification group MOD. The screen flow logic is as follows:

PROCESS BEFORE OUTPUT.
  MODULE status\_0100.
PROCESS AFTER INPUT.
  MODULE cancel AT EXIT-COMMAND.
  MODULE user\_command\_0100.

In GUI status SCREEN\_100, the function code TOGGLE is linked to a pushbutton. When the program is called, the bottommost four input and output fields are displayed as not ready for input since the variable flag initially contains a blank. The user can switch the ready-for-input status on and off using Display/Change.

Program DEMO\_DYNPRO\_MODIFY\_SCREEN demonstrates further dynamic screen modifications.

SET HOLD DATA

[Quick Reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapset_hold_data_shortref.htm)

Syntax

SET HOLD DATA *{*ON*|*OFF*}*.

Effect

During [PBO](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenpbo_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") processing, this statement turns the following standard menu items in the GUI status of the [dynpro](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendynpro_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") either on using the addition ON or off using the addition OFF:

-   System → User Profile → Hold Data
    This function saves the entries made by the user in the input fields of the dynpro for the duration of the current user session. Each time the [screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenscreen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the dynpro is displayed, these values are passed to the corresponding input fields as default values. This overwrites the values transported from the ABAP program.
    
-   System → User Profile → Set Data
    This function works like the 'Hold Data' function except that here, the corresponding input fields are no longer ready for input for all subsequent calls of the dynpro.
    
-   System → User Profile → Delete Data
    This function deletes all saved data and makes the input fields that were locked using 'Set Data' ready for input again for all subsequent calls of the dynpro.
    

Each time PBO processing starts, the setting made in the static properties of the dynpro under Hold Data is configured so that execution of SET HOLD DATA during [PAI](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenpai_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") processing does not have an effect on the display of the subsequent screen.

Note

The menu items above can be selected in every GUI status but only take effect when they are activated in the static properties of the dynpro using Hold Data or the statement SET HOLD DATA.

Dynpros, Holding Data

This example demonstrates how to hold input data across transactions.

Source Code

REPORT demo\_dynpro\_set\_hold\_data.
DATA field(10) TYPE c.
CALL SCREEN 100.
field = 'XXXXXXXXXX'.
CALL SCREEN 100.
MODULE hold\_data OUTPUT.
  SET HOLD DATA ON.
ENDMODULE.

Description

The static next dynpro of dynpro 100 is 0. It contains a single input/output field field. The dynpro flow logic is:

PROCESS BEFORE OUTPUT.
  MODULE hold\_data.
PROCESS AFTER INPUT.

In the PBO event of the dynpro, the Hold Data attribute is activated regardless of the static default. If, after entering a value, the user chooses System → User Profile → Hold Data or Set Data, the value is displayed again when the dynpro is called a second time and whenever the program is subsequently called (in the same [ABAP session](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenmain_session_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")) unless the user chooses Delete Data. This overwrites any value assigned to the field field in the ABAP program.

Effect

If this statement is specified during [PAI](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenpai_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") processing, depending on how FIELD or LINE is specified, it passes either the name of the screen element or the number of the row of a [table control](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentable_control_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or of the group of a [step loop](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenstep_loop_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") (on which the screen cursor is positioned after a user action) to the data objects field or line. field expects a character-like variable; line expects a variable of the type i. In [field\_properties](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapget_cursor_field.htm), further properties of the screen element can be defined.

If the cursor is in the command field of the [standard toolbar](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenstandard_toolbar_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or on a pushbutton in the [screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenscreen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), the statement is ignored and the specified variables remain unchanged. If the cursor in the first variant is not in a screen element of the current [dynpro](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendynpro_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") but on a bar in the GUI status, the contents of field and the variables specified in [field\_properties](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapget_cursor_field.htm) are initialized. If the cursor in the second variant is not on a screen element that is part of a table control or a step loop, the variable line is initialized.

System Fields

sy-subrc

Meaning

0

The cursor is on a screen element of the current dynpro, if FIELD is specified, or on the input field of the [standard toolbar](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenstandard_toolbar_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). If LINE is specified, the cursor is on a screen element within a table control or a step loop.

4

If FIELD is specified, the cursor is on a toolbar in the GUI status or, if LINE is specified, the cursor is outside a table control or a step loop.

Note

In the second variant, the same additions VALUE, LENGTH, and OFFSET could be specified after LINE as specified for the [use](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapget_cursor_list.htm) of the statement for lists.

Screens, Determining the Cursor Position

The example shows how to determine the cursor position on screens.

Source Code

PROGRAM demo\_dynpro\_get\_cursor .
DATA: ok\_code TYPE sy-ucomm,
      save\_ok LIKE ok\_code.
DATA: input\_output(20) TYPE c,
      fld(20) TYPE c,
      off     TYPE i,
      val(20) TYPE c,
      len     TYPE i.
CALL SCREEN 100.
MODULE init\_screen\_0100 OUTPUT.
  SET PF-STATUS 'STATUS\_100'.
ENDMODULE.
MODULE user\_command\_0100 INPUT.
  save\_ok = ok\_code.
  CLEAR ok\_code.
  CASE save\_ok.
    WHEN 'CANCEL'.
      LEAVE PROGRAM.
    WHEN 'SELE'.
      GET CURSOR FIELD fld OFFSET off VALUE val LENGTH len.
  ENDCASE.
ENDMODULE.

Description

The static next screen number of screen 100 is 100. All input/output fields except for the screen field of input\_output have been set as not ready for input in the Screen Painter. Module init\_screen\_0100 sets the GUI status to STATUS\_100 in the PBO event. In the GUI status, the 'Cancel' ( F12) has been activated using the function code CANCEL, and the function key F2 has been assigned the function code SELE. When the program is executed, the user may select all screen elements by double-clicking them or all interface elements linked to SELE. The output fields then show the corresponding cursor position.

Effect

For each [dynpro](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendynpro_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") used in the program, all [table controls](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentable_control_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and [tabstrip controls](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentabstrip_control_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") defined there have to be declared in the declaration part using the statement CONTROLS, otherwise a non-handleable exception is raised when the dynpro in question is called. contrl expects the name of the control defined in the dynpro to be specified directly. After TYPE, TABLEVIEW, or TABSTRIP must be used to specify whether it is a table control or a tabstrip control.

For each control, the CONTROLS statement creates a structure with the name of the control in the ABAP program. The structure components enable the respective control to be processed in the ABAP program.

Notes

-   For table controls, corresponding [loops](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/dynploop.htm) have to be programmed in the [dynpro flow logic](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendynpro_flow_logic_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). For tabstrip controls, suitable [subscreens](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/dynpcall.htm) have to be called.
    
-   [Splitter controls](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensplitter_control_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") cannot be declared using the CONTROLS statement. Instead the class CL\_DYNPRO\_SPLITTER is used.

CONTROLS - TYPE TABLEVIEW

[Quick Reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapcontrols_shortref.htm)

Syntax

CONTROLS contrl TYPE TABLEVIEW USING SCREEN dynnr.

Effect

Declares a [table control](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentable_control_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). If the type TABLEVIEW is specified in the statement CONTROLS, a [deep structure](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendeep_structure_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is created with the name of the [control](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencontrol_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and the type CXTAB\_CONTROL of the [type group](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentype_group_1_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") CXTAB. In [dynpro](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendynpro_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") processing, the components of the structure contain the attributes of the table control. Using this structure you can read and edit the attributes of the relevant table control.

At the top level, the deep structure CXTAB\_CONTROL contains components for the general attributes of the table control. The component COLS is an internal table of the structure CXTAB\_COLUMN and contains the attributes of individual columns. The structure CXTAB\_COLUMN contains a structured component SCREEN of the type [SCREEN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenscreen.htm). This component contains the attributes of the screen element of each column. With the exception of the component CURRENT\_LINE, all components of the structure CXTAB\_CONTROL can be set in the ABAP program.

dynnr expects the number of a dynpro on which a table control with the name contrl is defined. A literal or a constant of the type n with length 4 can be specified for dynnr. When a dynpro in which a table control called contrl is defined is called for the first time, the [start values](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenstart_value_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of certain components of the structure are taken from the definition of the table control whose dynpro is specified after USING.

The Structure CXTAB\_CONTROL

Component

Meaning

FIXED\_COLS

Number of lead columns. The start value is taken from the definition of the table control in the dynpro dynnr.

LINES

Controls the vertical scroll bar of the table control. If the [LOOP](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/dynploop.htm) is executed in the dynpro flow logic without reference to an internal table, that start value of LINES is 0 and must be set in the program so that the scroll bar can be used. With reference to an internal table, LINES is set to the current number of rows in the internal table if the table control is being processed for the first time. However, since this time is not defined, the value of LINES should also be explicitly set to the number of rows of the internal table before the [PBO](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenpbo_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") processing in this case.

TOP\_LINE

Top displayed row for next [PBO](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenpbo_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). Set at time of [PAI](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenpai_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") by the position of the vertical slider box.

CURRENT\_LINE

Current row during a LOOP in the dynpro flow logic. If the addition FROM of the statement [LOOP](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/dynploop.htm) is not specified, the value of CURRENT\_LINE corresponds to the result of sy-stepl + (TOP\_LINE - 1).

LEFT\_COL

Number of first horizontally scrollable column displayed after the lead columns. Is set at time of [PAI](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenpai_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") by the position of the horizontal slider box.

LINE\_SEL\_MODE

Row selection mode: "0" if no rows can be selected , "1" if one row, "2" if multiple rows. The start value is taken from the definition of the table control in the dynpro dynnr.

COL\_SEL\_MODE

Column selection mode: "0" if no columns can be selected , "1" if one column, "2" if multiple columns. The start value is taken from the definition of the table control in the dynpro dynnr.

LINE\_SELECTOR

Flag ("X" or " ") whether there is a selection column. The start value is taken from the definition of the table control in the dynpro dynnr.

H\_GRID

Flag ("X" or " ") whether there are horizontal separators. The start value is taken from the definition of the table control in the dynpro dynnr.

V\_GRID

Flag ("X" or " ") whether there are vertical separators. The start value is taken from the definition of the table control in the dynpro dynnr.

COLS

Control table for individual columns of the structure CXTAB\_COLUMN.

INVISIBLE

Flag ("X" or " ") indicating whether the table control is visible in the GUI window.

The Structure CXTAB\_COLUMN

Component

Meaning

SCREEN

Structure for the attributes of the screen element of the current column. The components can be set for the values described there either directly or using [MODIFY SCREEN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapmodify_screen.htm). MODIFY SCREEN overwrites a direct assignment.

INDEX

Current position of the column in the table control. The start value is taken from the definition of the table control in the dynpro dynnr. Is set to current value at time of [PAI](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenpai_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

SELECTED

Flag ("X" or " ") whether or not column is selected. Is set to current value at time of [PAI](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenpai_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

VISLENGTH

Visible length of the column. [Start value](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenstart_value_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is taken from the definition of the table control in dynpro dynnr.

INVISIBLE

Flag ("X" or " ") whether or not the column is visible in the table control.

Notes

-   In a table control, it is possible to scroll vertically using a scroll bar if the component LINES of the structure CXTAB\_CONTROL was set to the correct row number before the [PBO](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenpbo_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") processing of the table control. Every time the scroll bar is scrolled, the event [PAI](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenpai_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is raised with an empty function code and the component TOP\_LINE of the structure CXTAB\_CONTROL is automatically set to the new top row before the time of PBO.
    
-   For program-driven scrolling, it is sufficient to assign a value to the component TOP\_LINE of the structure CXTAB\_CONTROL during PBO processing. When scrolling by page, the number of rows scrolled can be taken from the system field sy-loopc in [loop executions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/dynploop.htm). sy-loopc contains the number of currently displayed rows and the component LINES of the structure CXTAB\_CONTROL contains the number of lines in the full table control.
    

Example

If a table control is defined on the dynpro with the number 100 and the rows of this table control are defined with reference to the database table SPFLI in ABAP Dictionary, the corresponding programming of the ABAP program can be as follows. In a PBO module prepare\_tab, an internal table spfli\_tab is filled with data from the database table. The number of rows of spfli\_tab is assigned to the component lines of the structure flight\_tab created using CONTROLS; this is done to activate the scroll bar of the table control. In a PAI module modify\_tab, the row of the internal table is modified whose primary table key matches that of the [interface work area](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abeninterface_work_area_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") spfli defined using TABLES. The PAI module modify\_tab is called for every displayed row of the table control. The corresponding dynpro flow logic can be seen in the example for [LOOP](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/dynploop.htm).

CONTROLS flight\_tab TYPE TABLEVIEW USING SCREEN '0100'.
TABLES spfli.
DATA spfli\_tab TYPE SORTED TABLE OF spfli
               WITH UNIQUE KEY carrid connid.
...
MODULE prepare\_tab OUTPUT.
  IF spfli\_tab IS INITIAL.
    SELECT \*
           FROM spfli
           INTO TABLE @spfli\_tab.
    flight\_tab-lines = lines( spfli\_tab ).
  ENDIF.
ENDMODULE.
MODULE modify\_tab INPUT.
  MODIFY TABLE spfli\_tab FROM spfli.
ENDMODULE.

If the type TABSTRIP is specified in the statement CONTROLS, a [deep structure](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendeep_structure_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is created with the name of the [control](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencontrol_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and the type CXTAB\_TABSTRIP of the [type group](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentype_group_1_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") CXTAB. From this structure, only the component ACTIVETAB is required in the program.

In [PBO](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenpbo_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") processing, the active tabstrip page is specified by assigning the function code of a [tab title](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentab_title_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") to the component ACTIVETAB. The first tabstrip page is active by default. When [scrolling](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendynp_subscreens.htm) in the SAP GUI, the tabstrip control can be initialized in this way. For any [scrolling](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendynp_subscreens.htm) in an ABAP program, the tabstrip page selected by the user must be activated by this assignment. It must also be ensured that the required [subscreen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensubscreen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is included in the [dynpro flow logic](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendynpro_flow_logic_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") using the statement [CALL SUBSCREEN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/dynpcall.htm).

In [PAI](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenpai_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") processing, the component ACTIVETAB contains the function code of the active tab title. When scrolling in the SAP GUI, the tabstrip page currently being displayed can be determined in this way.

Note

The same applies to the inclusion of subscreens of tabstrips using [CALL SUBSCREEN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/dynpcall.htm) as for normal subscreens.

Example

If, on a dynpro, a tabstrip control is defined with three untyped tab titles with the function codes "TAB1", "TAB2", and "TAB3" and a subscreen area SUB, the scrolling can be programmed in ABAP as follows. In a PBO module, prepare\_tabstrip, the component activetab of the structure tab\_strip created using CONTROLS is assigned the function code of the first tab title. After a tab title has been selected, this component is set to the relevant function code in the PAI module handle\_user\_command. The number of the required [subscreen dynpro](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensubscreen_dynpro_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is assigned to the data object dynnr that is used for including the subscreen in the dynpro flow logic. The associated programming of the dynpro flow logic can be seen in the example for [CALL SUBSCREEN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/dynpcall.htm).

CONTROLS tab\_strip TYPE TABSTRIP.
DATA: ok\_code      TYPE sy-ucomm,
      dynnr        TYPE sy-dynnr.
...
MODULE prepare\_tabstrip OUTPUT.
  IF tab\_strip-activetab IS INITIAL OR
     dynnr IS INITIAL.
    tab\_strip-activetab = 'TAB1'.
    dynnr = '0110'.
  ENDIF.
ENDMODULE.
MODULE handle\_user\_command INPUT.
  CASE ok\_code.
    WHEN 'TAB1'.
      dynnr = '0110'.
    WHEN 'TAB2'.
      dynnr = '0120'.
    WHEN 'TAB3'.
      dynnr = '0130'.
    ...
  ENDCASE.
  IF ok\_code(3) = 'TAB'.
    tab\_strip-activetab = ok\_code.
  ENDIF.
ENDMODULE.

SET HOLD DATA

[Quick Reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapset_hold_data_shortref.htm)

Syntax

SET HOLD DATA *{*ON*|*OFF*}*.

Effect

During [PBO](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenpbo_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") processing, this statement turns the following standard menu items in the GUI status of the [dynpro](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendynpro_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") either on using the addition ON or off using the addition OFF:

-   System → User Profile → Hold Data
    This function saves the entries made by the user in the input fields of the dynpro for the duration of the current user session. Each time the [screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenscreen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the dynpro is displayed, these values are passed to the corresponding input fields as default values. This overwrites the values transported from the ABAP program.
    
-   System → User Profile → Set Data
    This function works like the 'Hold Data' function except that here, the corresponding input fields are no longer ready for input for all subsequent calls of the dynpro.
    
-   System → User Profile → Delete Data
    This function deletes all saved data and makes the input fields that were locked using 'Set Data' ready for input again for all subsequent calls of the dynpro.
    

Each time PBO processing starts, the setting made in the static properties of the dynpro under Hold Data is configured so that execution of SET HOLD DATA during [PAI](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenpai_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") processing does not have an effect on the display of the subsequent screen.

Note

The menu items above can be selected in every GUI status but only take effect when they are activated in the static properties of the dynpro using Hold Data or the statement SET HOLD DATA.

Dynpros, Holding Data

This example demonstrates how to hold input data across transactions.

Source Code

REPORT demo\_dynpro\_set\_hold\_data.
DATA field(10) TYPE c.
CALL SCREEN 100.
field = 'XXXXXXXXXX'.
CALL SCREEN 100.
MODULE hold\_data OUTPUT.
  SET HOLD DATA ON.
ENDMODULE.

Description

The static next dynpro of dynpro 100 is 0. It contains a single input/output field field. The dynpro flow logic is:

PROCESS BEFORE OUTPUT.
  MODULE hold\_data.
PROCESS AFTER INPUT.

In the PBO event of the dynpro, the Hold Data attribute is activated regardless of the static default. If, after entering a value, the user chooses System → User Profile → Hold Data or Set Data, the value is displayed again when the dynpro is called a second time and whenever the program is subsequently called (in the same [ABAP session](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenmain_session_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")) unless the user chooses Delete Data. This overwrites any value assigned to the field field in the ABAP program.

Effect

This addition determines the data type of the columns low and high in the [selection table](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The data type can be defined by means of a static reference to an existing data object dobj or by a dynamic reference to a data type from ABAP Dictionary in name.

If the addition [NO-DISPLAY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_screen.htm) is not specified, the data type of the columns low and high in the selection table must be elementary and [flat](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenflat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and the numeric type f is not allowed. If the addition NO-DISPLAY is specified, any data types, except [enumerated types](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenenumerated_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), are possible.

Note

When referencing data types from ABAP Dictionary, the [selection criterion](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_criterion_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") inherits all the screen-relevant attributes defined there. During data transport to and from the input fields, any conversion routines defined in the domain are executed. The text defined in ABAP Dictionary can be inherited as a selection text. Note, however, that the input fields on the selection screen are associated with a global data object belonging to the program and do not have any real reference to the dictionary, in contrast to dynpro fields, which are created in Screen Painter with reference to the dictionary. This has a particular effect on automatic support for input help (F4) and value checking. In comparison with general dynpros, input help functions are limited here in that dependencies between fields and previously entered data are ignored. No automatic value checking is performed.

Alternative 1

... FOR dobj

Effect

If this addition is specified, the columns low and high in the selection table inherit all the attributes of a data object dobj that has already been declared, most importantly a reference to ABAP Dictionary, if applicable. dobj expects a data object that is elementary and flat and not of the type f (unless [NO-DISPLAY is used](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_screen.htm)) and is not an [enumerated type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenenumerated_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Note

As well as the data objects referred to using FOR from their own program, the public attributes of global classes are also relevant data objects.

Example

Typical declaration and application of a selection criterion.

DATA spfli\_wa TYPE spfli.
SELECT-OPTIONS s\_carrid FOR spfli\_wa-carrid.
SELECT \*
       FROM spfli
       WHERE carrid IN @s\_carrid
       INTO @spfli\_wa.
  ...
ENDSELECT.

Alternative 2

... FOR (name)

Effect

This addition is used to create the columns low and high in the selection table with data type c and length 45. The input fields are displayed on the selection screen, but with a length, field help, and input help appropriate for the data type specified in name.

name expects a [flat](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenflat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") character-like data object that contains the name of a component in a flat structure from ABAP Dictionary in uppercase letters when the selection screen is accessed. The following can be specified for name:

-   Constant

If the data object name is specified as a constant, it can be evaluated statically and the specified component is identified as the used object.

-   Variable

If the data object name is specified as a variable, it is specified only dynamically and the content is not evaluated statically.

A text field literal can be specified for name, but its content is ignored. If the [text pool](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentext_pool_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") currently loaded does not contain a selection text for the parameter, the output field displays the corresponding field label from ABAP Dictionary. When data is transported from the input field to the selection table, the content is converted as if it were assigned by the corresponding ABAP data type (no formatting characters, period as a decimal separator, date format "yyyymmdd", and so on).

If the content of name is not a structure component in ABAP Dictionary, the input fields are displayed according to the actual type of the columns low and high. This also applies if a literal is specified for name. If a selection text for the parameter is not created in the text pool currently loaded, the output field contains the text "Generic Selection Option".

A dynamic reference to a data type is not possible in a selection include for a [logical database](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenlogical_data_base_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Example

Dynamic design of the selection criterion selcrit on selection screen 500 based on the entries in the [standard selection screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenstandard_selscreen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") for an executable program.

Description

On the selection screen 100, the name of the table dbtab and its column column can be specified. These are then used for the dynamic layout of the selection criterion on the selection screen 500.

Two input fields and a pushbutton to enter additional values for the selection criterion are displayed. The value which the user enters in the first input field is written to the component selcrit-low of the selection table; the value for the second field is written to the component selcrit-high.

For more complex selections, the user can use the pushbutton on the right side of the selection screen to display the GUI window for multiple selections.

The contents of the selection table are then shown in a list. The first column determines whether the subsequent values are to be included or not; the second contains the Boolean operator and the last two columns contain the limits low and high.

SELECT-OPTIONS - FOR

[Quick Reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_shortref.htm)

Syntax

... FOR *{*dobj*|*(name)*}* ...

Alternatives:

[1\. ... FOR dobj](#!ABAP_ALTERNATIVE_1@1@)
[2\. ... FOR (name)](#!ABAP_ALTERNATIVE_2@2@)

Effect

This addition determines the data type of the columns low and high in the [selection table](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The data type can be defined by means of a static reference to an existing data object dobj or by a dynamic reference to a data type from ABAP Dictionary in name.

If the addition [NO-DISPLAY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_screen.htm) is not specified, the data type of the columns low and high in the selection table must be elementary and [flat](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenflat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and the numeric type f is not allowed. If the addition NO-DISPLAY is specified, any data types, except [enumerated types](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenenumerated_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), are possible.

Note

When referencing data types from ABAP Dictionary, the [selection criterion](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_criterion_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") inherits all the screen-relevant attributes defined there. During data transport to and from the input fields, any conversion routines defined in the domain are executed. The text defined in ABAP Dictionary can be inherited as a selection text. Note, however, that the input fields on the selection screen are associated with a global data object belonging to the program and do not have any real reference to the dictionary, in contrast to dynpro fields, which are created in Screen Painter with reference to the dictionary. This has a particular effect on automatic support for input help (F4) and value checking. In comparison with general dynpros, input help functions are limited here in that dependencies between fields and previously entered data are ignored. No automatic value checking is performed.

Alternative 1

... FOR dobj

Effect

If this addition is specified, the columns low and high in the selection table inherit all the attributes of a data object dobj that has already been declared, most importantly a reference to ABAP Dictionary, if applicable. dobj expects a data object that is elementary and flat and not of the type f (unless [NO-DISPLAY is used](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_screen.htm)) and is not an [enumerated type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenenumerated_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Note

As well as the data objects referred to using FOR from their own program, the public attributes of global classes are also relevant data objects.

Example

Typical declaration and application of a selection criterion.

DATA spfli\_wa TYPE spfli.
SELECT-OPTIONS s\_carrid FOR spfli\_wa-carrid.
SELECT \*
       FROM spfli
       WHERE carrid IN @s\_carrid
       INTO @spfli\_wa.
  ...
ENDSELECT.

Alternative 2

... FOR (name)

Effect

This addition is used to create the columns low and high in the selection table with data type c and length 45. The input fields are displayed on the selection screen, but with a length, field help, and input help appropriate for the data type specified in name.

name expects a [flat](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenflat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") character-like data object that contains the name of a component in a flat structure from ABAP Dictionary in uppercase letters when the selection screen is accessed. The following can be specified for name:

-   Constant

If the data object name is specified as a constant, it can be evaluated statically and the specified component is identified as the used object.

-   Variable

If the data object name is specified as a variable, it is specified only dynamically and the content is not evaluated statically.

A text field literal can be specified for name, but its content is ignored. If the [text pool](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentext_pool_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") currently loaded does not contain a selection text for the parameter, the output field displays the corresponding field label from ABAP Dictionary. When data is transported from the input field to the selection table, the content is converted as if it were assigned by the corresponding ABAP data type (no formatting characters, period as a decimal separator, date format "yyyymmdd", and so on).

If the content of name is not a structure component in ABAP Dictionary, the input fields are displayed according to the actual type of the columns low and high. This also applies if a literal is specified for name. If a selection text for the parameter is not created in the text pool currently loaded, the output field contains the text "Generic Selection Option".

A dynamic reference to a data type is not possible in a selection include for a [logical database](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenlogical_data_base_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Example

Dynamic design of the selection criterion selcrit on selection screen 500 based on the entries in the [standard selection screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenstandard_selscreen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") for an executable program.

PARAMETERS: dbtab  TYPE c LENGTH 30,
            column TYPE c LENGTH 30.
DATA name(80) TYPE c.
SELECTION-SCREEN BEGIN OF SCREEN 500 AS WINDOW.
SELECT-OPTIONS selcrit FOR (name).
SELECTION-SCREEN END OF SCREEN 500.
name = dbtab && '-' && column.

[4\. ... NO-EXTENSION](#!ABAP_ADDITION_4@4@)
[5\. ... NO INTERVALS](#!ABAP_ADDITION_5@5@)

Effect

These additions can be used to declare the first input field as a mandatory field, hide the input field on the [selection screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_screen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), and define the visible length of the field. The display of the second input field and the pushbutton for multiple selection can be suppressed. The addition [MODIF ID](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselection-screen_modif_id.htm) assigns all screen elements of the [selection criterion](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_criterion_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") to the [modification group](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenmodification_group_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") modid.

Note

As well as the additions already available, the function module SELECT\_OPTIONS\_RESTRICT can also be used to restrict the number of selection options offered and prohibit the value "E" for the column sign in the [selection table](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") before the selection screen is sent.

Addition 1

... OBLIGATORY

Effect

This addition defines the first input field for the selection criterion on the selection screen as a mandatory field. If this field is blank, the user cannot exit the selection screen using the Execute function (F8) and can only use the Back, Exit, or Cancel functions.

Addition 2

... NO-DISPLAY

Effect

If this addition is specified, no screen elements are created on the selection screen for the selection criterion. In an [executable program](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenexecutable_program_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), a selection criterion of this type is used exclusively as part of the interface defined by the selection screen. It can be supplied with a value by the calling program when it is called with [SUBMIT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapsubmit.htm).

If the addition NO-DISPLAY is specified, the low and high columns in the selection table can have any [flat](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenflat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") data types. These selection tables can only be supplied with data using the addition [WITH](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapsubmit_selscreen_parameters.htm) of the statement SUBMIT.

Note

The length of the values passed to the columns low and high in the selection table, for which there is no input field, is not restricted to 45 characters, as is the case for selection criteria with input fields.

Addition 3

... VISIBLE LENGTH vlen

Effect

This addition defines the visible length of the input field as vlen, where vlen is entered directly as a positive number. If vlen is shorter than the length of columns low and high in the selection table and shorter than the maximum visible length, it is possible to scroll in the input field, which is displayed with the length of vlen. Otherwise, the addition is ignored.

Addition 4

... NO-EXTENSION

Effect

If this addition is specified, the pushbutton for multiple selection is not created on the [selection screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_screen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Note

The user cannot access the dialog box for multiple selection on the selection screen, which means that he or she cannot edit [selection tables](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") containing multiple rows.

Addition 5

... NO INTERVALS

Effect

If this addition is specified, the second input field is not created on the selection screen.

Note

The user can only specify a single comparison in the first row of the selection table on the selection screen. Intervals can still be selected in the dialog box for multiple selection.

Example

Declaration of a selection criterion for which a single comparison is possible on the selection screen, but multiple selection is not possible.

DATA spfli\_wa TYPE spfli.
SELECT-OPTIONS s\_carrid FOR spfli\_wa-carrid NO-EXTENSION
                                            NO INTERVALS.

[3\. ... MATCHCODE OBJECT search\_help](#!ABAP_ADDITION_3@3@)
[4\. ... MEMORY ID pid](#!ABAP_ADDITION_4@4@)

Effect

These additions allow a start value to be specified, allow lowercase, and integrate a search help or a [SPA/GPA parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenspa_gpa_parameter_1_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Addition 1

... DEFAULT val1 *\[*TO val2*\]* *\[*OPTION opt*\]* *\[*SIGN sgn*\]*

Effect

This addition defines [start values](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenstart_value_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") for the columns in the first row of the [selection table](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). Without the addition DEFAULT, type-dependent [initial values](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abeninitial_value_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") are used as start values.

val1 and val2 are used to define start values for columns low and high. These start values can either be specified as literals or as previously defined data objects. If the data type of the specified start values does not match the data type of the columns, these are converted according to the conversion rules.

The addition OPTION is used to define the start value for the option column. If the addition TO is not specified, one of the expressions eq, ne, ge, gt, le, lt, cp, or np must be specified directly for opt. If the addition TO is specified, either specify bt or nb must be specified. If the addition OPTION is not used, the content of the option column is set to ""EQ" or "BT". If specify cp or np are specified, the start value in val1 must contain at least one of the wildcard characters "\*" or "+" when data is passed to the selection table, otherwise the program terminates.

The addition SIGN is used to define the start value for the sign column. Either i or e must be specified directly for sgn. If the addition SIGN is not used, the content of column sign is changed to "I".

The times at which the start values are passed to the first position in the selection table are processed in the same way as with the addition DEFAULT to the [PARAMETERS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapparameters_value.htm) statement. If the selection table is not empty when the transfer takes place, the start values are not transferred to the first position. Only the [header line](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenheader_line_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in the selection table is filled with these values, which does not influence the [selection criterion](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_criterion_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Notes

-   The associated input fields on the [selection screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_screen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") are only filled with the start values if the first row in the selection table is not changed before the selection screen is sent. The system displays the value contained in the selection table when the event [AT SELECTION-SCREEN OUTPUT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapat_selection-screen.htm) has been processed. Start values for multiple selection can only be defined by inserting lines in the selection table.
    
-   If start values are specified, these must have the internal format of the ABAP values, and not the output format of the screen display.
    

Addition 2

... LOWER CASE

Effect

This addition prevents the content of character-like fields from being converted to block capitals when the data is transported from the input fields on the selection screen to the selection table.

Addition 3

... MATCHCODE OBJECT search\_help

Effect

This addition associates the input fields for the selection criterion with a search help search\_help from ABAP Dictionary. The name of the search help must be specified directly. The addition has the same effect on the input fields as when it is used with a [PARAMETERS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapparameters_value.htm) statement for an input field for a parameter.

Addition 4

... MEMORY ID pid

Effect

This addition associates the first input field with an [SPA/GPA parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenspa_gpa_parameter_1_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in the [user memory](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenuser_memory_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The ID pid of the SPA/GPA parameter must be specified directly and it can contain a maximum of 20 characters. The addition has the same effect on the first input field as when it is used with a [PARAMETERS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapparameters_value.htm) statement for an input field for a parameter.

If the specified ID pid is not in the database table TPARA, the extended program check reports an error.

Selection Screens, Default Values for Selection Criteria

The example shows which default values you can set for selection criteria.

Source Code

REPORT demo\_sel\_screen\_select\_default.
DATA wa\_spfli TYPE spfli.
SELECT-OPTIONS airline FOR wa\_spfli-carrid
               DEFAULT 'AA'
                    TO 'LH'
                OPTION  nb
                  SIGN  i.

Description

The symbol before the first field indicates that the field airline-option contains the operator NB. The green colour indicates that the field airline-sign contains the value "I". The arrow on the right pushbutton is not green since only one line of the selection table is filled.

[3\. ... MATCHCODE OBJECT search\_help](#!ABAP_ADDITION_3@3@)
[4\. ... MEMORY ID pid](#!ABAP_ADDITION_4@4@)

Effect

These additions allow a start value to be specified, allow lowercase, and integrate a search help or a [SPA/GPA parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenspa_gpa_parameter_1_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Addition 1

... DEFAULT val1 *\[*TO val2*\]* *\[*OPTION opt*\]* *\[*SIGN sgn*\]*

Effect

This addition defines [start values](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenstart_value_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") for the columns in the first row of the [selection table](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). Without the addition DEFAULT, type-dependent [initial values](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abeninitial_value_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") are used as start values.

val1 and val2 are used to define start values for columns low and high. These start values can either be specified as literals or as previously defined data objects. If the data type of the specified start values does not match the data type of the columns, these are converted according to the conversion rules.

The addition OPTION is used to define the start value for the option column. If the addition TO is not specified, one of the expressions eq, ne, ge, gt, le, lt, cp, or np must be specified directly for opt. If the addition TO is specified, either specify bt or nb must be specified. If the addition OPTION is not used, the content of the option column is set to ""EQ" or "BT". If specify cp or np are specified, the start value in val1 must contain at least one of the wildcard characters "\*" or "+" when data is passed to the selection table, otherwise the program terminates.

The addition SIGN is used to define the start value for the sign column. Either i or e must be specified directly for sgn. If the addition SIGN is not used, the content of column sign is changed to "I".

The times at which the start values are passed to the first position in the selection table are processed in the same way as with the addition DEFAULT to the [PARAMETERS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapparameters_value.htm) statement. If the selection table is not empty when the transfer takes place, the start values are not transferred to the first position. Only the [header line](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenheader_line_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in the selection table is filled with these values, which does not influence the [selection criterion](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_criterion_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Notes

-   The associated input fields on the [selection screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_screen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") are only filled with the start values if the first row in the selection table is not changed before the selection screen is sent. The system displays the value contained in the selection table when the event [AT SELECTION-SCREEN OUTPUT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapat_selection-screen.htm) has been processed. Start values for multiple selection can only be defined by inserting lines in the selection table.
    
-   If start values are specified, these must have the internal format of the ABAP values, and not the output format of the screen display.
    

Addition 2

... LOWER CASE

Effect

This addition prevents the content of character-like fields from being converted to block capitals when the data is transported from the input fields on the selection screen to the selection table.

Addition 3

... MATCHCODE OBJECT search\_help

Effect

This addition associates the input fields for the selection criterion with a search help search\_help from ABAP Dictionary. The name of the search help must be specified directly. The addition has the same effect on the input fields as when it is used with a [PARAMETERS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapparameters_value.htm) statement for an input field for a parameter.

Addition 4

... MEMORY ID pid

Effect

This addition associates the first input field with an [SPA/GPA parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenspa_gpa_parameter_1_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in the [user memory](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenuser_memory_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The ID pid of the SPA/GPA parameter must be specified directly and it can contain a maximum of 20 characters. The addition has the same effect on the first input field as when it is used with a [PARAMETERS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapparameters_value.htm) statement for an input field for a parameter.

If the specified ID pid is not in the database table TPARA, the extended program check reports an error.

SELECT-OPTIONS

[Quick Reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_shortref.htm)

Syntax

SELECT-OPTIONS selcrit [FOR *{*dobj*|*(name)*}*](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_for.htm)
               *\[* [screen\_options](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_screen.htm)*\]*

Effect

This declares a selection criterion selcrit for a data object dobj or a type specified in name. Selection criteria are components of a [selection screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_screen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), to which are assigned a [selection table](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in the ABAP program, as well as two input fields and a pushbutton for multiple selection.

The name of the selection criterion selcrit is limited to a maximum of 8 characters. This statement is allowed in the global declaration part of [executable programs](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenexecutable_program_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), [function groups](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenfunction_group_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), and [module pools](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenmodul_pool_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). In function groups and module pools, the statement is only allowed within the definition of a [standalone selection screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselection-screen_definition.htm). In executable programs, the statement is otherwise automatically assigned to the [standard selection screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselection-screen_standard.htm).

The statement SELECT-OPTIONS has the following effect:

-   The statement declares a selection table in the program with the name selcrit. A selection table is an internal [standard table](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenstandard_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") with [header line](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenheader_line_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and [standard key](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenstandard_key_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). In selection tables, multiple selection conditions can be saved. The content of selection tables can be analyzed in a [relational expression](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenrelational_expression_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") with the [relational operator](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenrelational_operator_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [IN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenlogexp_select_option.htm) or in a [similar expression](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenwhere_logexp_seltab.htm) of a WHERE condition in Open SQL. Selection tables have the following four columns:
    

-   sign of type c and length 1. The content of sign determines for every row whether the result of the condition formulated in the column is included or excluded in the entire resulting set for all rows. Valid values are "I" for include and "E" for exclude.

-   option of type c with length 2. option contains the selection option for the condition of the row in the form of relational operators. Valid operators are "EQ", "NE", "GE", "GT", "LE", "LT", "CP", and "NP", if the column high is initial, and "BT", "NB", if column high is not initial. For the options "CP" and "NP", the data type of the columns low and high must be c, and special rules apply to entries on the selection screen.

-   low of the data type defined after [FOR](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_for.htm). This column is designated for the comparison value or the lower interval limitation.

-   high of the data type defined after [FOR](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_for.htm). This column is designated for the upper interval limitation.

-   Two input fields with the name selcrit-low and selcrit-high are created on the current selection screen using a matching external data type in a new row at positions 35 and 60. The length of the input fields is based upon the length of the data type which is defined after FOR. The maximum length of the input fields is 255. The maximum visible length of the input fields is between 10 and 18 (depending on the nesting depth in framed blocks). If the length is greater than the maximum visible length, the content is displayed as movable.
    An output field generated automatically is displayed in the first position available to the left of the input field as a label with a length of between 20 and 30 depending on the nesting depth in blocks with frames. The output field contains either the name of the selcrit selection criterion or the selection text to which the selection criterion is assigned in the text elements of the program. If the user requests field or input help on the output field using the function key F1 or F4, the same output is displayed as if one of the input fields is chosen.
    A multiple selection pushbutton is created after the second input field. If this pushbutton is selected, a dialog screen with four [tabstrip control pages](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentab_page_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") appears, in which the input fields are again displayed in tabular form in [Table Controls](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentable_control_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The tabstrip pages are separated based on individual value comparison, interval limitation, and settings for the column sign.
    Users can select an input field with a double-click on the selection screen or use the dialog screen for multiple selection. On the selection screen, the value of the column sign can also be chosen. On the dialog screen for multiple selection, this is done by selecting the respective tabstrip page. If the selection option is not equal to "EQ" or "BT", it is displayed as an icon in front of the first input field. The color of the icon is green if the content of the column sign is "I", and red if it is "E".
    The selection options "CP" and "NP" can be selected only if the first input field contains one of the wildcard characters "\*" or "+". "+" masks a single character, "\*" masks any character string, even an empty one. If one of these characters is entered, the selection option is automatically set to "CP". If "CP" is set, and all wildcard characters have been removed, the selection option is automatically set to "EQ" when there is a user action. This limitation does not apply within the program. When the selection table is evaluated, the column low can also contain a string without wildcard characters for the selection options "CP" and "NP".
    The attributes of the elements on the selection screen can be influenced with the statement [screen\_options](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_screen.htm) or the statement [SELECTION-SCREEN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselection-screen.htm).
    
-   The first row of the selection table selcrit is associated with the input fields on the selection screen. All rows are displayed in the dialog box for multiple selection.
    Each time before the selection screen is sent to the [selection screen event](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_screen_event_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") ATSELECTION-SCREEN OUTPUT, the content of first row in the selection table is transported to the selection screen, with a [conversion routine](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenconversion_routine_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") being executed if required. If the length of the columns low and high in the first row of the selection table is greater than 255, the surplus content is cut off on the right. It is only possible for all rows to be transported if the button for multiple selections is selected. A conversion routine might be executed here, and rows might be cut off. Settings for the content of the input fields can be made in [value\_options](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_value.htm).
    After a user action on the selection screen, the contents of the input fields and the chosen settings are transported to the first row and the header row of the selection table.
    After a user action on the dialog box for multiple selections, the contents of all input fields and the chosen settings are transported to the rows of the selection table. During these transports, the contents of character-type fields are converted by default into capitals, after which a conversion routine is performed, if required. After each transport, various [selection screen events](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapat_selection-screen_events.htm) are raised.
    If a value has been entered in the entry field for the upper interval high, the system checks whether this value is greater than the lower interval limit low following each transport and conversion routine (if performed). If necessary, an [error message](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenerror_message_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is sent. This check can be switched off before the selection screen is sent, using the function module RS\_SELOPT\_NO\_INTERVAL\_CHECK.
    
-   If selection criteria are defined in the selection include of a logical database, further additions [ldb\_options](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_ldb.htm) are necessary or possible.
    
-   If, in an executable program, a selection criterion is defined for a component of a node of the associated logical database, declared by [TABLES](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abaptables.htm) or [NODES](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapnodes.htm), and the node in question is intended for dynamic selection on the logical database, the selection table is passed (by default) to the logical database, after [selection screen processing](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselscreen_processing_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), where it is handled as a dynamic selection. Furthermore, in this case, the input fields for the corresponding dynamic selection are displayed directly on the selection screen. Therefore the user does not need to select the fields using the Dynamic Selections function. This transfer can be suppressed using the addition [NO DATABASE SELECTION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_no_db_sel.htm).
    

Notes

-   To avoid undefined system behavior, the header row of a selection table should not be changed in the program. Read access should also be avoided. Instead separate work areas, field symbols, or data references should be used, as always for internal tables.
    
-   If a selection criterion is supplied with data when calling up an executable program using [SUBMIT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapsubmit.htm), a [conversion routine](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenconversion_routine_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") may be performed for the first row only, while the value of the columns low and high will be truncated at position 255 for the first row only. If the selection criterion is declared with the addition [NO-DISPLAY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_screen.htm), no conversion routine or truncation will be performed for the first row either.
    
-   If the type of the selection criterion is a [decimal floating point number](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendecfloat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that does not refer to a data type in ABAP Dictionary, the output style preserve scaling is set for the input field of the selection screen. Here, any trailing zeroes are preserved in the decimal places. If there is a reference to a data type in the ABAP Dictionary, the output style defined there is used.
    
-   If the type of the selection criteria is a [packed number](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenpacked_number_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or a [decimal floating point number](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendecfloat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") defined in ABAP Dictionary, the attribute sign must be set for the type attribute, so that negative numbers can be displayed on the selection screen. This setting is only possible for [domains](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendomain_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and not for specifying a built-in type directly for [data elements](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendata_element_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or structure components. If a negative number is entered on the selection screen and this property is not set, the system rejects it with an error message. If the columns low or high contain a negative number when the selection screen is called, an non-handleable exception is raised.
    
-   If the type of the selection criterion is a [decimal floating point number](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendecfloat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") defined in ABAP Dictionary for which the output style "currency amount" is specified, only numbers with the corresponding amount of decimal places can be entered on the selection screen. If a corresponding ABAP data object contains a number with too many decimal places when the selection screen is called, a non-handleable exception is raised. If the output style is "extended currency amount", additional decimal places can be displayed.
    
-   The columns sign and option of a selection table declared using SELECT-OPTIONS are not related to data types in ABAP Dictionary. In the case of [ranges tables](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenranges_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") defined in ABAP Dictionary, these columns refer to the data elements DDSIGN and DDOPTION.

SELECT-OPTIONS - FOR

[Quick Reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_shortref.htm)

Syntax

... FOR *{*dobj*|*(name)*}* ...

Alternatives:

[1\. ... FOR dobj](#!ABAP_ALTERNATIVE_1@1@)
[2\. ... FOR (name)](#!ABAP_ALTERNATIVE_2@2@)

Effect

This addition determines the data type of the columns low and high in the [selection table](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The data type can be defined by means of a static reference to an existing data object dobj or by a dynamic reference to a data type from ABAP Dictionary in name.

If the addition [NO-DISPLAY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_screen.htm) is not specified, the data type of the columns low and high in the selection table must be elementary and [flat](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenflat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and the numeric type f is not allowed. If the addition NO-DISPLAY is specified, any data types, except [enumerated types](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenenumerated_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), are possible.

Note

When referencing data types from ABAP Dictionary, the [selection criterion](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_criterion_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") inherits all the screen-relevant attributes defined there. During data transport to and from the input fields, any conversion routines defined in the domain are executed. The text defined in ABAP Dictionary can be inherited as a selection text. Note, however, that the input fields on the selection screen are associated with a global data object belonging to the program and do not have any real reference to the dictionary, in contrast to dynpro fields, which are created in Screen Painter with reference to the dictionary. This has a particular effect on automatic support for input help (F4) and value checking. In comparison with general dynpros, input help functions are limited here in that dependencies between fields and previously entered data are ignored. No automatic value checking is performed.

Alternative 1

... FOR dobj

Effect

If this addition is specified, the columns low and high in the selection table inherit all the attributes of a data object dobj that has already been declared, most importantly a reference to ABAP Dictionary, if applicable. dobj expects a data object that is elementary and flat and not of the type f (unless [NO-DISPLAY is used](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_screen.htm)) and is not an [enumerated type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenenumerated_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Note

As well as the data objects referred to using FOR from their own program, the public attributes of global classes are also relevant data objects.

Example

Typical declaration and application of a selection criterion.

DATA spfli\_wa TYPE spfli.
SELECT-OPTIONS s\_carrid FOR spfli\_wa-carrid.
SELECT \*
       FROM spfli
       WHERE carrid IN @s\_carrid
       INTO @spfli\_wa.
  ...
ENDSELECT.

Alternative 2

... FOR (name)

Effect

This addition is used to create the columns low and high in the selection table with data type c and length 45. The input fields are displayed on the selection screen, but with a length, field help, and input help appropriate for the data type specified in name.

name expects a [flat](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenflat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") character-like data object that contains the name of a component in a flat structure from ABAP Dictionary in uppercase letters when the selection screen is accessed. The following can be specified for name:

-   Constant

If the data object name is specified as a constant, it can be evaluated statically and the specified component is identified as the used object.

-   Variable

If the data object name is specified as a variable, it is specified only dynamically and the content is not evaluated statically.

A text field literal can be specified for name, but its content is ignored. If the [text pool](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentext_pool_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") currently loaded does not contain a selection text for the parameter, the output field displays the corresponding field label from ABAP Dictionary. When data is transported from the input field to the selection table, the content is converted as if it were assigned by the corresponding ABAP data type (no formatting characters, period as a decimal separator, date format "yyyymmdd", and so on).

If the content of name is not a structure component in ABAP Dictionary, the input fields are displayed according to the actual type of the columns low and high. This also applies if a literal is specified for name. If a selection text for the parameter is not created in the text pool currently loaded, the output field contains the text "Generic Selection Option".

A dynamic reference to a data type is not possible in a selection include for a [logical database](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenlogical_data_base_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Example

Dynamic design of the selection criterion selcrit on selection screen 500 based on the entries in the [standard selection screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenstandard_selscreen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") for an executable program.

Description

On the selection screen 100, the name of the table dbtab and its column column can be specified. These are then used for the dynamic layout of the selection criterion on the selection screen 500.

Two input fields and a pushbutton to enter additional values for the selection criterion are displayed. The value which the user enters in the first input field is written to the component selcrit-low of the selection table; the value for the second field is written to the component selcrit-high.

For more complex selections, the user can use the pushbutton on the right side of the selection screen to display the GUI window for multiple selections.

The contents of the selection table are then shown in a list. The first column determines whether the subsequent values are to be included or not; the second contains the Boolean operator and the last two columns contain the limits low and high.

[4\. ... NO-EXTENSION](#!ABAP_ADDITION_4@4@)
[5\. ... NO INTERVALS](#!ABAP_ADDITION_5@5@)

Effect

These additions can be used to declare the first input field as a mandatory field, hide the input field on the [selection screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_screen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), and define the visible length of the field. The display of the second input field and the pushbutton for multiple selection can be suppressed. The addition [MODIF ID](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselection-screen_modif_id.htm) assigns all screen elements of the [selection criterion](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_criterion_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") to the [modification group](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenmodification_group_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") modid.

Note

As well as the additions already available, the function module SELECT\_OPTIONS\_RESTRICT can also be used to restrict the number of selection options offered and prohibit the value "E" for the column sign in the [selection table](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") before the selection screen is sent.

Addition 1

... OBLIGATORY

Effect

This addition defines the first input field for the selection criterion on the selection screen as a mandatory field. If this field is blank, the user cannot exit the selection screen using the Execute function (F8) and can only use the Back, Exit, or Cancel functions.

Addition 2

... NO-DISPLAY

Effect

If this addition is specified, no screen elements are created on the selection screen for the selection criterion. In an [executable program](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenexecutable_program_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), a selection criterion of this type is used exclusively as part of the interface defined by the selection screen. It can be supplied with a value by the calling program when it is called with [SUBMIT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapsubmit.htm).

If the addition NO-DISPLAY is specified, the low and high columns in the selection table can have any [flat](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenflat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") data types. These selection tables can only be supplied with data using the addition [WITH](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapsubmit_selscreen_parameters.htm) of the statement SUBMIT.

Note

The length of the values passed to the columns low and high in the selection table, for which there is no input field, is not restricted to 45 characters, as is the case for selection criteria with input fields.

Addition 3

... VISIBLE LENGTH vlen

Effect

This addition defines the visible length of the input field as vlen, where vlen is entered directly as a positive number. If vlen is shorter than the length of columns low and high in the selection table and shorter than the maximum visible length, it is possible to scroll in the input field, which is displayed with the length of vlen. Otherwise, the addition is ignored.

Addition 4

... NO-EXTENSION

Effect

If this addition is specified, the pushbutton for multiple selection is not created on the [selection screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_screen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Note

The user cannot access the dialog box for multiple selection on the selection screen, which means that he or she cannot edit [selection tables](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") containing multiple rows.

Addition 5

... NO INTERVALS

Effect

If this addition is specified, the second input field is not created on the selection screen.

Note

The user can only specify a single comparison in the first row of the selection table on the selection screen. Intervals can still be selected in the dialog box for multiple selection.

Example

Declaration of a selection criterion for which a single comparison is possible on the selection screen, but multiple selection is not possible.

DATA spfli\_wa TYPE spfli.
SELECT-OPTIONS s\_carrid FOR spfli\_wa-carrid NO-EXTENSION
                                            NO INTERVALS.

These additions allow a start value to be specified, allow lowercase, and integrate a search help or a [SPA/GPA parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenspa_gpa_parameter_1_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Addition 1

... DEFAULT val1 *\[*TO val2*\]* *\[*OPTION opt*\]* *\[*SIGN sgn*\]*

Effect

This addition defines [start values](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenstart_value_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") for the columns in the first row of the [selection table](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). Without the addition DEFAULT, type-dependent [initial values](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abeninitial_value_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") are used as start values.

val1 and val2 are used to define start values for columns low and high. These start values can either be specified as literals or as previously defined data objects. If the data type of the specified start values does not match the data type of the columns, these are converted according to the conversion rules.

The addition OPTION is used to define the start value for the option column. If the addition TO is not specified, one of the expressions eq, ne, ge, gt, le, lt, cp, or np must be specified directly for opt. If the addition TO is specified, either specify bt or nb must be specified. If the addition OPTION is not used, the content of the option column is set to ""EQ" or "BT". If specify cp or np are specified, the start value in val1 must contain at least one of the wildcard characters "\*" or "+" when data is passed to the selection table, otherwise the program terminates.

The addition SIGN is used to define the start value for the sign column. Either i or e must be specified directly for sgn. If the addition SIGN is not used, the content of column sign is changed to "I".

The times at which the start values are passed to the first position in the selection table are processed in the same way as with the addition DEFAULT to the [PARAMETERS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapparameters_value.htm) statement. If the selection table is not empty when the transfer takes place, the start values are not transferred to the first position. Only the [header line](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenheader_line_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in the selection table is filled with these values, which does not influence the [selection criterion](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_criterion_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Notes

-   The associated input fields on the [selection screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_screen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") are only filled with the start values if the first row in the selection table is not changed before the selection screen is sent. The system displays the value contained in the selection table when the event [AT SELECTION-SCREEN OUTPUT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapat_selection-screen.htm) has been processed. Start values for multiple selection can only be defined by inserting lines in the selection table.
    
-   If start values are specified, these must have the internal format of the ABAP values, and not the output format of the screen display.
    

Addition 2

... LOWER CASE

Effect

This addition prevents the content of character-like fields from being converted to block capitals when the data is transported from the input fields on the selection screen to the selection table.

Addition 3

... MATCHCODE OBJECT search\_help

Effect

This addition associates the input fields for the selection criterion with a search help search\_help from ABAP Dictionary. The name of the search help must be specified directly. The addition has the same effect on the input fields as when it is used with a [PARAMETERS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapparameters_value.htm) statement for an input field for a parameter.

Addition 4

... MEMORY ID pid

Effect

This addition associates the first input field with an [SPA/GPA parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenspa_gpa_parameter_1_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in the [user memory](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenuser_memory_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The ID pid of the SPA/GPA parameter must be specified directly and it can contain a maximum of 20 characters. The addition has the same effect on the first input field as when it is used with a [PARAMETERS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapparameters_value.htm) statement for an input field for a parameter.

If the specified ID pid is not in the database table TPARA, the extended program check reports an error.

Selection Screens, Default Values for Selection Criteria

The example shows which default values you can set for selection criteria.

Source Code

REPORT demo\_sel\_screen\_select\_default.
DATA wa\_spfli TYPE spfli.
SELECT-OPTIONS airline FOR wa\_spfli-carrid
               DEFAULT 'AA'
                    TO 'LH'
                OPTION  nb
                  SIGN  i.

Description

The symbol before the first field indicates that the field airline-option contains the operator NB. The green colour indicates that the field airline-sign contains the value "I". The arrow on the right pushbutton is not green since only one line of the selection table is filled.

Effect

This declares a selection criterion selcrit for a data object dobj or a type specified in name. Selection criteria are components of a [selection screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_screen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), to which are assigned a [selection table](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in the ABAP program, as well as two input fields and a pushbutton for multiple selection.

The name of the selection criterion selcrit is limited to a maximum of 8 characters. This statement is allowed in the global declaration part of [executable programs](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenexecutable_program_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), [function groups](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenfunction_group_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), and [module pools](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenmodul_pool_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). In function groups and module pools, the statement is only allowed within the definition of a [standalone selection screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselection-screen_definition.htm). In executable programs, the statement is otherwise automatically assigned to the [standard selection screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselection-screen_standard.htm).

The statement SELECT-OPTIONS has the following effect:

-   The statement declares a selection table in the program with the name selcrit. A selection table is an internal [standard table](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenstandard_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") with [header line](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenheader_line_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and [standard key](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenstandard_key_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). In selection tables, multiple selection conditions can be saved. The content of selection tables can be analyzed in a [relational expression](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenrelational_expression_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") with the [relational operator](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenrelational_operator_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [IN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenlogexp_select_option.htm) or in a [similar expression](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenwhere_logexp_seltab.htm) of a WHERE condition in Open SQL. Selection tables have the following four columns:
    

-   sign of type c and length 1. The content of sign determines for every row whether the result of the condition formulated in the column is included or excluded in the entire resulting set for all rows. Valid values are "I" for include and "E" for exclude.

-   option of type c with length 2. option contains the selection option for the condition of the row in the form of relational operators. Valid operators are "EQ", "NE", "GE", "GT", "LE", "LT", "CP", and "NP", if the column high is initial, and "BT", "NB", if column high is not initial. For the options "CP" and "NP", the data type of the columns low and high must be c, and special rules apply to entries on the selection screen.

-   low of the data type defined after [FOR](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_for.htm). This column is designated for the comparison value or the lower interval limitation.

-   high of the data type defined after [FOR](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_for.htm). This column is designated for the upper interval limitation.

-   Two input fields with the name selcrit-low and selcrit-high are created on the current selection screen using a matching external data type in a new row at positions 35 and 60. The length of the input fields is based upon the length of the data type which is defined after FOR. The maximum length of the input fields is 255. The maximum visible length of the input fields is between 10 and 18 (depending on the nesting depth in framed blocks). If the length is greater than the maximum visible length, the content is displayed as movable.
    An output field generated automatically is displayed in the first position available to the left of the input field as a label with a length of between 20 and 30 depending on the nesting depth in blocks with frames. The output field contains either the name of the selcrit selection criterion or the selection text to which the selection criterion is assigned in the text elements of the program. If the user requests field or input help on the output field using the function key F1 or F4, the same output is displayed as if one of the input fields is chosen.
    A multiple selection pushbutton is created after the second input field. If this pushbutton is selected, a dialog screen with four [tabstrip control pages](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentab_page_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") appears, in which the input fields are again displayed in tabular form in [Table Controls](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentable_control_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The tabstrip pages are separated based on individual value comparison, interval limitation, and settings for the column sign.
    Users can select an input field with a double-click on the selection screen or use the dialog screen for multiple selection. On the selection screen, the value of the column sign can also be chosen. On the dialog screen for multiple selection, this is done by selecting the respective tabstrip page. If the selection option is not equal to "EQ" or "BT", it is displayed as an icon in front of the first input field. The color of the icon is green if the content of the column sign is "I", and red if it is "E".
    The selection options "CP" and "NP" can be selected only if the first input field contains one of the wildcard characters "\*" or "+". "+" masks a single character, "\*" masks any character string, even an empty one. If one of these characters is entered, the selection option is automatically set to "CP". If "CP" is set, and all wildcard characters have been removed, the selection option is automatically set to "EQ" when there is a user action. This limitation does not apply within the program. When the selection table is evaluated, the column low can also contain a string without wildcard characters for the selection options "CP" and "NP".
    The attributes of the elements on the selection screen can be influenced with the statement [screen\_options](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_screen.htm) or the statement [SELECTION-SCREEN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselection-screen.htm).
    
-   The first row of the selection table selcrit is associated with the input fields on the selection screen. All rows are displayed in the dialog box for multiple selection.
    Each time before the selection screen is sent to the [selection screen event](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_screen_event_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") ATSELECTION-SCREEN OUTPUT, the content of first row in the selection table is transported to the selection screen, with a [conversion routine](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenconversion_routine_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") being executed if required. If the length of the columns low and high in the first row of the selection table is greater than 255, the surplus content is cut off on the right. It is only possible for all rows to be transported if the button for multiple selections is selected. A conversion routine might be executed here, and rows might be cut off. Settings for the content of the input fields can be made in [value\_options](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_value.htm).
    After a user action on the selection screen, the contents of the input fields and the chosen settings are transported to the first row and the header row of the selection table.
    After a user action on the dialog box for multiple selections, the contents of all input fields and the chosen settings are transported to the rows of the selection table. During these transports, the contents of character-type fields are converted by default into capitals, after which a conversion routine is performed, if required. After each transport, various [selection screen events](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapat_selection-screen_events.htm) are raised.
    If a value has been entered in the entry field for the upper interval high, the system checks whether this value is greater than the lower interval limit low following each transport and conversion routine (if performed). If necessary, an [error message](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenerror_message_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is sent. This check can be switched off before the selection screen is sent, using the function module RS\_SELOPT\_NO\_INTERVAL\_CHECK.
    
-   If selection criteria are defined in the selection include of a logical database, further additions [ldb\_options](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_ldb.htm) are necessary or possible.
    
-   If, in an executable program, a selection criterion is defined for a component of a node of the associated logical database, declared by [TABLES](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abaptables.htm) or [NODES](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapnodes.htm), and the node in question is intended for dynamic selection on the logical database, the selection table is passed (by default) to the logical database, after [selection screen processing](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselscreen_processing_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), where it is handled as a dynamic selection. Furthermore, in this case, the input fields for the corresponding dynamic selection are displayed directly on the selection screen. Therefore the user does not need to select the fields using the Dynamic Selections function. This transfer can be suppressed using the addition [NO DATABASE SELECTION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_no_db_sel.htm).
    

Notes

-   To avoid undefined system behavior, the header row of a selection table should not be changed in the program. Read access should also be avoided. Instead separate work areas, field symbols, or data references should be used, as always for internal tables.
    
-   If a selection criterion is supplied with data when calling up an executable program using [SUBMIT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapsubmit.htm), a [conversion routine](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenconversion_routine_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") may be performed for the first row only, while the value of the columns low and high will be truncated at position 255 for the first row only. If the selection criterion is declared with the addition [NO-DISPLAY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_screen.htm), no conversion routine or truncation will be performed for the first row either.
    
-   If the type of the selection criterion is a [decimal floating point number](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendecfloat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that does not refer to a data type in ABAP Dictionary, the output style preserve scaling is set for the input field of the selection screen. Here, any trailing zeroes are preserved in the decimal places. If there is a reference to a data type in the ABAP Dictionary, the output style defined there is used.
    
-   If the type of the selection criteria is a [packed number](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenpacked_number_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or a [decimal floating point number](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendecfloat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") defined in ABAP Dictionary, the attribute sign must be set for the type attribute, so that negative numbers can be displayed on the selection screen. This setting is only possible for [domains](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendomain_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and not for specifying a built-in type directly for [data elements](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendata_element_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or structure components. If a negative number is entered on the selection screen and this property is not set, the system rejects it with an error message. If the columns low or high contain a negative number when the selection screen is called, an non-handleable exception is raised.
    
-   If the type of the selection criterion is a [decimal floating point number](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendecfloat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") defined in ABAP Dictionary for which the output style "currency amount" is specified, only numbers with the corresponding amount of decimal places can be entered on the selection screen. If a corresponding ABAP data object contains a number with too many decimal places when the selection screen is called, a non-handleable exception is raised. If the output style is "extended currency amount", additional decimal places can be displayed.
    
-   The columns sign and option of a selection table declared using SELECT-OPTIONS are not related to data types in ABAP Dictionary. In the case of [ranges tables](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenranges_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") defined in ABAP Dictionary, these columns refer to the data elements DDSIGN and DDOPTION.

[Quick Reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_shortref.htm)

Syntax

... FOR *{*dobj*|*(name)*}* ...

Alternatives:

[1\. ... FOR dobj](#!ABAP_ALTERNATIVE_1@1@)
[2\. ... FOR (name)](#!ABAP_ALTERNATIVE_2@2@)

Effect

This addition determines the data type of the columns low and high in the [selection table](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The data type can be defined by means of a static reference to an existing data object dobj or by a dynamic reference to a data type from ABAP Dictionary in name.

If the addition [NO-DISPLAY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_screen.htm) is not specified, the data type of the columns low and high in the selection table must be elementary and [flat](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenflat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and the numeric type f is not allowed. If the addition NO-DISPLAY is specified, any data types, except [enumerated types](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenenumerated_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), are possible.

Note

When referencing data types from ABAP Dictionary, the [selection criterion](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_criterion_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") inherits all the screen-relevant attributes defined there. During data transport to and from the input fields, any conversion routines defined in the domain are executed. The text defined in ABAP Dictionary can be inherited as a selection text. Note, however, that the input fields on the selection screen are associated with a global data object belonging to the program and do not have any real reference to the dictionary, in contrast to dynpro fields, which are created in Screen Painter with reference to the dictionary. This has a particular effect on automatic support for input help (F4) and value checking. In comparison with general dynpros, input help functions are limited here in that dependencies between fields and previously entered data are ignored. No automatic value checking is performed.

Alternative 1

... FOR dobj

Effect

If this addition is specified, the columns low and high in the selection table inherit all the attributes of a data object dobj that has already been declared, most importantly a reference to ABAP Dictionary, if applicable. dobj expects a data object that is elementary and flat and not of the type f (unless [NO-DISPLAY is used](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_screen.htm)) and is not an [enumerated type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenenumerated_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Note

As well as the data objects referred to using FOR from their own program, the public attributes of global classes are also relevant data objects.

Example

Typical declaration and application of a selection criterion.

DATA spfli\_wa TYPE spfli.
SELECT-OPTIONS s\_carrid FOR spfli\_wa-carrid.
SELECT \*
       FROM spfli
       WHERE carrid IN @s\_carrid
       INTO @spfli\_wa.
  ...
ENDSELECT.

Alternative 2

... FOR (name)

Effect

This addition is used to create the columns low and high in the selection table with data type c and length 45. The input fields are displayed on the selection screen, but with a length, field help, and input help appropriate for the data type specified in name.

name expects a [flat](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenflat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") character-like data object that contains the name of a component in a flat structure from ABAP Dictionary in uppercase letters when the selection screen is accessed. The following can be specified for name:

-   Constant

If the data object name is specified as a constant, it can be evaluated statically and the specified component is identified as the used object.

-   Variable

If the data object name is specified as a variable, it is specified only dynamically and the content is not evaluated statically.

A text field literal can be specified for name, but its content is ignored. If the [text pool](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentext_pool_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") currently loaded does not contain a selection text for the parameter, the output field displays the corresponding field label from ABAP Dictionary. When data is transported from the input field to the selection table, the content is converted as if it were assigned by the corresponding ABAP data type (no formatting characters, period as a decimal separator, date format "yyyymmdd", and so on).

If the content of name is not a structure component in ABAP Dictionary, the input fields are displayed according to the actual type of the columns low and high. This also applies if a literal is specified for name. If a selection text for the parameter is not created in the text pool currently loaded, the output field contains the text "Generic Selection Option".

A dynamic reference to a data type is not possible in a selection include for a [logical database](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenlogical_data_base_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Example

Dynamic design of the selection criterion selcrit on selection screen 500 based on the entries in the [standard selection screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenstandard_selscreen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") for an executable program.

Description

On the selection screen 100, the name of the table dbtab and its column column can be specified. These are then used for the dynamic layout of the selection criterion on the selection screen 500.

Two input fields and a pushbutton to enter additional values for the selection criterion are displayed. The value which the user enters in the first input field is written to the component selcrit-low of the selection table; the value for the second field is written to the component selcrit-high.

For more complex selections, the user can use the pushbutton on the right side of the selection screen to display the GUI window for multiple selections.

The contents of the selection table are then shown in a list. The first column determines whether the subsequent values are to be included or not; the second contains the Boolean operator and the last two columns contain the limits low and high.

The addition [MODIF ID](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselection-screen_modif_id.htm) assigns all screen elements of the [selection criterion](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_criterion_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") to the [modification group](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenmodification_group_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") modid.

Note

As well as the additions already available, the function module SELECT\_OPTIONS\_RESTRICT can also be used to restrict the number of selection options offered and prohibit the value "E" for the column sign in the [selection table](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") before the selection screen is sent.

Addition 1

... OBLIGATORY

Effect

This addition defines the first input field for the selection criterion on the selection screen as a mandatory field. If this field is blank, the user cannot exit the selection screen using the Execute function (F8) and can only use the Back, Exit, or Cancel functions.

Addition 2

... NO-DISPLAY

Effect

If this addition is specified, no screen elements are created on the selection screen for the selection criterion. In an [executable program](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenexecutable_program_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), a selection criterion of this type is used exclusively as part of the interface defined by the selection screen. It can be supplied with a value by the calling program when it is called with [SUBMIT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapsubmit.htm).

If the addition NO-DISPLAY is specified, the low and high columns in the selection table can have any [flat](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenflat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") data types. These selection tables can only be supplied with data using the addition [WITH](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapsubmit_selscreen_parameters.htm) of the statement SUBMIT.

Note

The length of the values passed to the columns low and high in the selection table, for which there is no input field, is not restricted to 45 characters, as is the case for selection criteria with input fields.

Addition 3

... VISIBLE LENGTH vlen

Effect

This addition defines the visible length of the input field as vlen, where vlen is entered directly as a positive number. If vlen is shorter than the length of columns low and high in the selection table and shorter than the maximum visible length, it is possible to scroll in the input field, which is displayed with the length of vlen. Otherwise, the addition is ignored.

Addition 4

... NO-EXTENSION

Effect

If this addition is specified, the pushbutton for multiple selection is not created on the [selection screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_screen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Note

The user cannot access the dialog box for multiple selection on the selection screen, which means that he or she cannot edit [selection tables](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") containing multiple rows.

Addition 5

... NO INTERVALS

Effect

If this addition is specified, the second input field is not created on the selection screen.

Note

The user can only specify a single comparison in the first row of the selection table on the selection screen. Intervals can still be selected in the dialog box for multiple selection.

Example

Declaration of a selection criterion for which a single comparison is possible on the selection screen, but multiple selection is not possible.

DATA spfli\_wa TYPE spfli.
SELECT-OPTIONS s\_carrid FOR spfli\_wa-carrid NO-EXTENSION
                                            NO INTERVALS.

Effect

These additions allow a start value to be specified, allow lowercase, and integrate a search help or a [SPA/GPA parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenspa_gpa_parameter_1_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Addition 1

... DEFAULT val1 *\[*TO val2*\]* *\[*OPTION opt*\]* *\[*SIGN sgn*\]*

Effect

This addition defines [start values](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenstart_value_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") for the columns in the first row of the [selection table](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). Without the addition DEFAULT, type-dependent [initial values](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abeninitial_value_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") are used as start values.

val1 and val2 are used to define start values for columns low and high. These start values can either be specified as literals or as previously defined data objects. If the data type of the specified start values does not match the data type of the columns, these are converted according to the conversion rules.

The addition OPTION is used to define the start value for the option column. If the addition TO is not specified, one of the expressions eq, ne, ge, gt, le, lt, cp, or np must be specified directly for opt. If the addition TO is specified, either specify bt or nb must be specified. If the addition OPTION is not used, the content of the option column is set to ""EQ" or "BT". If specify cp or np are specified, the start value in val1 must contain at least one of the wildcard characters "\*" or "+" when data is passed to the selection table, otherwise the program terminates.

The addition SIGN is used to define the start value for the sign column. Either i or e must be specified directly for sgn. If the addition SIGN is not used, the content of column sign is changed to "I".

The times at which the start values are passed to the first position in the selection table are processed in the same way as with the addition DEFAULT to the [PARAMETERS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapparameters_value.htm) statement. If the selection table is not empty when the transfer takes place, the start values are not transferred to the first position. Only the [header line](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenheader_line_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in the selection table is filled with these values, which does not influence the [selection criterion](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_criterion_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Notes

-   The associated input fields on the [selection screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_screen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") are only filled with the start values if the first row in the selection table is not changed before the selection screen is sent. The system displays the value contained in the selection table when the event [AT SELECTION-SCREEN OUTPUT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapat_selection-screen.htm) has been processed. Start values for multiple selection can only be defined by inserting lines in the selection table.
    
-   If start values are specified, these must have the internal format of the ABAP values, and not the output format of the screen display.
    

Addition 2

... LOWER CASE

Effect

This addition prevents the content of character-like fields from being converted to block capitals when the data is transported from the input fields on the selection screen to the selection table.

Addition 3

... MATCHCODE OBJECT search\_help

Effect

This addition associates the input fields for the selection criterion with a search help search\_help from ABAP Dictionary. The name of the search help must be specified directly. The addition has the same effect on the input fields as when it is used with a [PARAMETERS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapparameters_value.htm) statement for an input field for a parameter.

Addition 4

... MEMORY ID pid

Effect

This addition associates the first input field with an [SPA/GPA parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenspa_gpa_parameter_1_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in the [user memory](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenuser_memory_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The ID pid of the SPA/GPA parameter must be specified directly and it can contain a maximum of 20 characters. The addition has the same effect on the first input field as when it is used with a [PARAMETERS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapparameters_value.htm) statement for an input field for a parameter.

If the specified ID pid is not in the database table TPARA, the extended program check reports an error.

Selection Screens, Default Values for Selection Criteria

The example shows which default values you can set for selection criteria.

Source Code

REPORT demo\_sel\_screen\_select\_default.
DATA wa\_spfli TYPE spfli.
SELECT-OPTIONS airline FOR wa\_spfli-carrid
               DEFAULT 'AA'
                    TO 'LH'
                OPTION  nb
                  SIGN  i.

Description

The symbol before the first field indicates that the field airline-option contains the operator NB. The green colour indicates that the field airline-sign contains the value "I". The arrow on the right pushbutton is not green since only one line of the selection table is filled.

Effect

This declares a selection criterion selcrit for a data object dobj or a type specified in name. Selection criteria are components of a [selection screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_screen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), to which are assigned a [selection table](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in the ABAP program, as well as two input fields and a pushbutton for multiple selection.

The name of the selection criterion selcrit is limited to a maximum of 8 characters. This statement is allowed in the global declaration part of [executable programs](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenexecutable_program_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), [function groups](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenfunction_group_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), and [module pools](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenmodul_pool_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). In function groups and module pools, the statement is only allowed within the definition of a [standalone selection screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselection-screen_definition.htm). In executable programs, the statement is otherwise automatically assigned to the [standard selection screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselection-screen_standard.htm).

The statement SELECT-OPTIONS has the following effect:

-   The statement declares a selection table in the program with the name selcrit. A selection table is an internal [standard table](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenstandard_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") with [header line](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenheader_line_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and [standard key](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenstandard_key_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). In selection tables, multiple selection conditions can be saved. The content of selection tables can be analyzed in a [relational expression](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenrelational_expression_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") with the [relational operator](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenrelational_operator_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [IN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenlogexp_select_option.htm) or in a [similar expression](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenwhere_logexp_seltab.htm) of a WHERE condition in Open SQL. Selection tables have the following four columns:
    

-   sign of type c and length 1. The content of sign determines for every row whether the result of the condition formulated in the column is included or excluded in the entire resulting set for all rows. Valid values are "I" for include and "E" for exclude.

-   option of type c with length 2. option contains the selection option for the condition of the row in the form of relational operators. Valid operators are "EQ", "NE", "GE", "GT", "LE", "LT", "CP", and "NP", if the column high is initial, and "BT", "NB", if column high is not initial. For the options "CP" and "NP", the data type of the columns low and high must be c, and special rules apply to entries on the selection screen.

-   low of the data type defined after [FOR](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_for.htm). This column is designated for the comparison value or the lower interval limitation.

-   high of the data type defined after [FOR](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_for.htm). This column is designated for the upper interval limitation.

-   Two input fields with the name selcrit-low and selcrit-high are created on the current selection screen using a matching external data type in a new row at positions 35 and 60. The length of the input fields is based upon the length of the data type which is defined after FOR. The maximum length of the input fields is 255. The maximum visible length of the input fields is between 10 and 18 (depending on the nesting depth in framed blocks). If the length is greater than the maximum visible length, the content is displayed as movable.
    An output field generated automatically is displayed in the first position available to the left of the input field as a label with a length of between 20 and 30 depending on the nesting depth in blocks with frames. The output field contains either the name of the selcrit selection criterion or the selection text to which the selection criterion is assigned in the text elements of the program. If the user requests field or input help on the output field using the function key F1 or F4, the same output is displayed as if one of the input fields is chosen.
    A multiple selection pushbutton is created after the second input field. If this pushbutton is selected, a dialog screen with four [tabstrip control pages](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentab_page_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") appears, in which the input fields are again displayed in tabular form in [Table Controls](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentable_control_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The tabstrip pages are separated based on individual value comparison, interval limitation, and settings for the column sign.
    Users can select an input field with a double-click on the selection screen or use the dialog screen for multiple selection. On the selection screen, the value of the column sign can also be chosen. On the dialog screen for multiple selection, this is done by selecting the respective tabstrip page. If the selection option is not equal to "EQ" or "BT", it is displayed as an icon in front of the first input field. The color of the icon is green if the content of the column sign is "I", and red if it is "E".
    The selection options "CP" and "NP" can be selected only if the first input field contains one of the wildcard characters "\*" or "+". "+" masks a single character, "\*" masks any character string, even an empty one. If one of these characters is entered, the selection option is automatically set to "CP". If "CP" is set, and all wildcard characters have been removed, the selection option is automatically set to "EQ" when there is a user action. This limitation does not apply within the program. When the selection table is evaluated, the column low can also contain a string without wildcard characters for the selection options "CP" and "NP".
    The attributes of the elements on the selection screen can be influenced with the statement [screen\_options](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_screen.htm) or the statement [SELECTION-SCREEN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselection-screen.htm).
    
-   The first row of the selection table selcrit is associated with the input fields on the selection screen. All rows are displayed in the dialog box for multiple selection.
    Each time before the selection screen is sent to the [selection screen event](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_screen_event_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") ATSELECTION-SCREEN OUTPUT, the content of first row in the selection table is transported to the selection screen, with a [conversion routine](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenconversion_routine_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") being executed if required. If the length of the columns low and high in the first row of the selection table is greater than 255, the surplus content is cut off on the right. It is only possible for all rows to be transported if the button for multiple selections is selected. A conversion routine might be executed here, and rows might be cut off. Settings for the content of the input fields can be made in [value\_options](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_value.htm).
    After a user action on the selection screen, the contents of the input fields and the chosen settings are transported to the first row and the header row of the selection table.
    After a user action on the dialog box for multiple selections, the contents of all input fields and the chosen settings are transported to the rows of the selection table. During these transports, the contents of character-type fields are converted by default into capitals, after which a conversion routine is performed, if required. After each transport, various [selection screen events](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapat_selection-screen_events.htm) are raised.
    If a value has been entered in the entry field for the upper interval high, the system checks whether this value is greater than the lower interval limit low following each transport and conversion routine (if performed). If necessary, an [error message](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenerror_message_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is sent. This check can be switched off before the selection screen is sent, using the function module RS\_SELOPT\_NO\_INTERVAL\_CHECK.
    
-   If selection criteria are defined in the selection include of a logical database, further additions [ldb\_options](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_ldb.htm) are necessary or possible.
    
-   If, in an executable program, a selection criterion is defined for a component of a node of the associated logical database, declared by [TABLES](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abaptables.htm) or [NODES](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapnodes.htm), and the node in question is intended for dynamic selection on the logical database, the selection table is passed (by default) to the logical database, after [selection screen processing](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselscreen_processing_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), where it is handled as a dynamic selection. Furthermore, in this case, the input fields for the corresponding dynamic selection are displayed directly on the selection screen. Therefore the user does not need to select the fields using the Dynamic Selections function. This transfer can be suppressed using the addition [NO DATABASE SELECTION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_no_db_sel.htm).
    

Notes

-   To avoid undefined system behavior, the header row of a selection table should not be changed in the program. Read access should also be avoided. Instead separate work areas, field symbols, or data references should be used, as always for internal tables.
    
-   If a selection criterion is supplied with data when calling up an executable program using [SUBMIT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapsubmit.htm), a [conversion routine](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenconversion_routine_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") may be performed for the first row only, while the value of the columns low and high will be truncated at position 255 for the first row only. If the selection criterion is declared with the addition [NO-DISPLAY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_screen.htm), no conversion routine or truncation will be performed for the first row either.
    
-   If the type of the selection criterion is a [decimal floating point number](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendecfloat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that does not refer to a data type in ABAP Dictionary, the output style preserve scaling is set for the input field of the selection screen. Here, any trailing zeroes are preserved in the decimal places. If there is a reference to a data type in the ABAP Dictionary, the output style defined there is used.
    
-   If the type of the selection criteria is a [packed number](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenpacked_number_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or a [decimal floating point number](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendecfloat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") defined in ABAP Dictionary, the attribute sign must be set for the type attribute, so that negative numbers can be displayed on the selection screen. This setting is only possible for [domains](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendomain_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and not for specifying a built-in type directly for [data elements](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendata_element_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or structure components. If a negative number is entered on the selection screen and this property is not set, the system rejects it with an error message. If the columns low or high contain a negative number when the selection screen is called, an non-handleable exception is raised.
    
-   If the type of the selection criterion is a [decimal floating point number](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendecfloat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") defined in ABAP Dictionary for which the output style "currency amount" is specified, only numbers with the corresponding amount of decimal places can be entered on the selection screen. If a corresponding ABAP data object contains a number with too many decimal places when the selection screen is called, a non-handleable exception is raised. If the output style is "extended currency amount", additional decimal places can be displayed.
    
-   The columns sign and option of a selection table declared using SELECT-OPTIONS are not related to data types in ABAP Dictionary. In the case of [ranges tables](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenranges_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") defined in ABAP Dictionary, these columns refer to the data elements DDSIGN and DDOPTION.

[Quick Reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_shortref.htm)

Syntax

... FOR *{*dobj*|*(name)*}* ...

Alternatives:

[1\. ... FOR dobj](#!ABAP_ALTERNATIVE_1@1@)
[2\. ... FOR (name)](#!ABAP_ALTERNATIVE_2@2@)

Effect

This addition determines the data type of the columns low and high in the [selection table](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The data type can be defined by means of a static reference to an existing data object dobj or by a dynamic reference to a data type from ABAP Dictionary in name.

If the addition [NO-DISPLAY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_screen.htm) is not specified, the data type of the columns low and high in the selection table must be elementary and [flat](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenflat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and the numeric type f is not allowed. If the addition NO-DISPLAY is specified, any data types, except [enumerated types](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenenumerated_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), are possible.

Note

When referencing data types from ABAP Dictionary, the [selection criterion](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_criterion_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") inherits all the screen-relevant attributes defined there. During data transport to and from the input fields, any conversion routines defined in the domain are executed. The text defined in ABAP Dictionary can be inherited as a selection text. Note, however, that the input fields on the selection screen are associated with a global data object belonging to the program and do not have any real reference to the dictionary, in contrast to dynpro fields, which are created in Screen Painter with reference to the dictionary. This has a particular effect on automatic support for input help (F4) and value checking. In comparison with general dynpros, input help functions are limited here in that dependencies between fields and previously entered data are ignored. No automatic value checking is performed.

Alternative 1

... FOR dobj

Effect

If this addition is specified, the columns low and high in the selection table inherit all the attributes of a data object dobj that has already been declared, most importantly a reference to ABAP Dictionary, if applicable. dobj expects a data object that is elementary and flat and not of the type f (unless [NO-DISPLAY is used](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_screen.htm)) and is not an [enumerated type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenenumerated_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Note

As well as the data objects referred to using FOR from their own program, the public attributes of global classes are also relevant data objects.

Example

Typical declaration and application of a selection criterion.

DATA spfli\_wa TYPE spfli.
SELECT-OPTIONS s\_carrid FOR spfli\_wa-carrid.
SELECT \*
       FROM spfli
       WHERE carrid IN @s\_carrid
       INTO @spfli\_wa.
  ...
ENDSELECT.

Alternative 2

... FOR (name)

Effect

This addition is used to create the columns low and high in the selection table with data type c and length 45. The input fields are displayed on the selection screen, but with a length, field help, and input help appropriate for the data type specified in name.

name expects a [flat](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenflat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") character-like data object that contains the name of a component in a flat structure from ABAP Dictionary in uppercase letters when the selection screen is accessed. The following can be specified for name:

-   Constant

If the data object name is specified as a constant, it can be evaluated statically and the specified component is identified as the used object.

-   Variable

If the data object name is specified as a variable, it is specified only dynamically and the content is not evaluated statically.

A text field literal can be specified for name, but its content is ignored. If the [text pool](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentext_pool_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") currently loaded does not contain a selection text for the parameter, the output field displays the corresponding field label from ABAP Dictionary. When data is transported from the input field to the selection table, the content is converted as if it were assigned by the corresponding ABAP data type (no formatting characters, period as a decimal separator, date format "yyyymmdd", and so on).

If the content of name is not a structure component in ABAP Dictionary, the input fields are displayed according to the actual type of the columns low and high. This also applies if a literal is specified for name. If a selection text for the parameter is not created in the text pool currently loaded, the output field contains the text "Generic Selection Option".

A dynamic reference to a data type is not possible in a selection include for a [logical database](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenlogical_data_base_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Example

Dynamic design of the selection criterion selcrit on selection screen 500 based on the entries in the [standard selection screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenstandard_selscreen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") for an executable program.

Description

On the selection screen 100, the name of the table dbtab and its column column can be specified. These are then used for the dynamic layout of the selection criterion on the selection screen 500.

Two input fields and a pushbutton to enter additional values for the selection criterion are displayed. The value which the user enters in the first input field is written to the component selcrit-low of the selection table; the value for the second field is written to the component selcrit-high.

For more complex selections, the user can use the pushbutton on the right side of the selection screen to display the GUI window for multiple selections.

The contents of the selection table are then shown in a list. The first column determines whether the subsequent values are to be included or not; the second contains the Boolean operator and the last two columns contain the limits low and high.

Effect

This addition determines the data type of the columns low and high in the [selection table](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The data type can be defined by means of a static reference to an existing data object dobj or by a dynamic reference to a data type from ABAP Dictionary in name.

If the addition [NO-DISPLAY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_screen.htm) is not specified, the data type of the columns low and high in the selection table must be elementary and [flat](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenflat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and the numeric type f is not allowed.

Note

When referencing data types from ABAP Dictionary, the [selection criterion](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_criterion_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") inherits all the screen-relevant attributes defined there.

This has a particular effect on automatic support for input help (F4) and value checking. In comparison with general dynpros, input help functions are limited here in that dependencies between fields and previously entered data are ignored. No automatic value checking is performed.

Alternative 1

... FOR dobj

Effect

If this addition is specified, the columns low and high in the selection table inherit all the attributes of a data object dobj that has already been declared, most importantly a reference to ABAP Dictionary, if applicable. dobj expects a data object that is elementary and flat and not of the type f (unless [NO-DISPLAY is used](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_screen.htm)) and is not an [enumerated type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenenumerated_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Note

As well as the data objects referred to using FOR from their own program, the public attributes of global classes are also relevant data objects.

Example

Typical declaration and application of a selection criterion.

DATA spfli\_wa TYPE spfli.
SELECT-OPTIONS s\_carrid FOR spfli\_wa-carrid.
SELECT \*
       FROM spfli
       WHERE carrid IN @s\_carrid
       INTO @spfli\_wa.
  ...
ENDSELECT.

Alternative 2

... FOR (name)

Effect

This addition is used to create the columns low and high in the selection table with data type c and length 45. The input fields are displayed on the selection screen, but with a length, field help, and input help appropriate for the data type specified in name.

name expects a [flat](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenflat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") character-like data object that contains the name of a component in a flat structure from ABAP Dictionary in uppercase letters when the selection screen is accessed. The following can be specified for name:

-   Constant

If the data object name is specified as a constant, it can be evaluated statically and the specified component is identified as the used object.

-   Variable

If the data object name is specified as a variable, it is specified only dynamically and the content is not evaluated statically.

A text field literal can be specified for name, but its content is ignored. If the [text pool](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentext_pool_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") currently loaded does not contain a selection text for the parameter, the output field displays the corresponding field label from ABAP Dictionary. When data is transported from the input field to the selection table, the content is converted as if it were assigned by the corresponding ABAP data type (no formatting characters, period as a decimal separator, date format "yyyymmdd", and so on).

If the content of name is not a structure component in ABAP Dictionary, the input fields are displayed according to the actual type of the columns low and high. This also applies if a literal is specified for name. If a selection text for the parameter is not created in the text pool currently loaded, the output field contains the text "Generic Selection Option".

A dynamic reference to a data type is not possible in a selection include for a [logical database](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenlogical_data_base_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Example

Dynamic design of the selection criterion selcrit on selection screen 500 based on the entries in the [standard selection screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenstandard_selscreen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") for an executable program.

PARAMETERS: dbtab  TYPE c LENGTH 30,
            column TYPE c LENGTH 30.
DATA name(80) TYPE c.
SELECTION-SCREEN BEGIN OF SCREEN 500 AS WINDOW.
SELECT-OPTIONS selcrit FOR (name).
SELECTION-SCREEN END OF SCREEN 500.
name = dbtab && '-' && column.
CALL SELECTION-SCREEN 500 STARTING AT 10 10.

[4\. ... NO-EXTENSION](#!ABAP_ADDITION_4@4@)
[5\. ... NO INTERVALS](#!ABAP_ADDITION_5@5@)

Effect

These additions can be used to declare the first input field as a mandatory field, hide the input field on the [selection screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_screen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), and define the visible length of the field. The display of the second input field and the pushbutton for multiple selection can be suppressed. The addition [MODIF ID](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselection-screen_modif_id.htm) assigns all screen elements of the [selection criterion](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_criterion_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") to the [modification group](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenmodification_group_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") modid.

Note

As well as the additions already available, the function module SELECT\_OPTIONS\_RESTRICT can also be used to restrict the number of selection options offered and prohibit the value "E" for the column sign in the [selection table](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") before the selection screen is sent.

Addition 1

... OBLIGATORY

Effect

This addition defines the first input field for the selection criterion on the selection screen as a mandatory field. If this field is blank, the user cannot exit the selection screen using the Execute function (F8) and can only use the Back, Exit, or Cancel functions.

Addition 2

... NO-DISPLAY

Effect

If this addition is specified, no screen elements are created on the selection screen for the selection criterion. In an [executable program](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenexecutable_program_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), a selection criterion of this type is used exclusively as part of the interface defined by the selection screen. It can be supplied with a value by the calling program when it is called with [SUBMIT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapsubmit.htm).

If the addition NO-DISPLAY is specified, the low and high columns in the selection table can have any [flat](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenflat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") data types. These selection tables can only be supplied with data using the addition [WITH](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapsubmit_selscreen_parameters.htm) of the statement SUBMIT.

Note

The length of the values passed to the columns low and high in the selection table, for which there is no input field, is not restricted to 45 characters, as is the case for selection criteria with input fields.

Addition 3

... VISIBLE LENGTH vlen

Effect

This addition defines the visible length of the input field as vlen, where vlen is entered directly as a positive number. If vlen is shorter than the length of columns low and high in the selection table and shorter than the maximum visible length, it is possible to scroll in the input field, which is displayed with the length of vlen. Otherwise, the addition is ignored.

Addition 4

... NO-EXTENSION

Effect

If this addition is specified, the pushbutton for multiple selection is not created on the [selection screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_screen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Note

The user cannot access the dialog box for multiple selection on the selection screen, which means that he or she cannot edit [selection tables](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") containing multiple rows.

Addition 5

... NO INTERVALS

Effect

If this addition is specified, the second input field is not created on the selection screen.

Note

The user can only specify a single comparison in the first row of the selection table on the selection screen. Intervals can still be selected in the dialog box for multiple selection.

Example

Declaration of a selection criterion for which a single comparison is possible on the selection screen, but multiple selection is not possible.

DATA spfli\_wa TYPE spfli.
SELECT-OPTIONS s\_carrid FOR spfli\_wa-carrid NO-EXTENSION
                                            NO INTERVALS.

Effect

These additions allow a start value to be specified, allow lowercase, and integrate a search help or a [SPA/GPA parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenspa_gpa_parameter_1_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Addition 1

... DEFAULT val1 *\[*TO val2*\]* *\[*OPTION opt*\]* *\[*SIGN sgn*\]*

Effect

This addition defines [start values](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenstart_value_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") for the columns in the first row of the [selection table](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). Without the addition DEFAULT, type-dependent [initial values](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abeninitial_value_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") are used as start values.

val1 and val2 are used to define start values for columns low and high. These start values can either be specified as literals or as previously defined data objects. If the data type of the specified start values does not match the data type of the columns, these are converted according to the conversion rules.

The addition OPTION is used to define the start value for the option column. If the addition TO is not specified, one of the expressions eq, ne, ge, gt, le, lt, cp, or np must be specified directly for opt. If the addition TO is specified, either specify bt or nb must be specified. If the addition OPTION is not used, the content of the option column is set to ""EQ" or "BT". If specify cp or np are specified, the start value in val1 must contain at least one of the wildcard characters "\*" or "+" when data is passed to the selection table, otherwise the program terminates.

The addition SIGN is used to define the start value for the sign column. Either i or e must be specified directly for sgn. If the addition SIGN is not used, the content of column sign is changed to "I".

The times at which the start values are passed to the first position in the selection table are processed in the same way as with the addition DEFAULT to the [PARAMETERS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapparameters_value.htm) statement. If the selection table is not empty when the transfer takes place, the start values are not transferred to the first position. Only the [header line](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenheader_line_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in the selection table is filled with these values, which does not influence the [selection criterion](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_criterion_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Notes

-   The associated input fields on the [selection screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_screen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") are only filled with the start values if the first row in the selection table is not changed before the selection screen is sent. The system displays the value contained in the selection table when the event [AT SELECTION-SCREEN OUTPUT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapat_selection-screen.htm) has been processed. Start values for multiple selection can only be defined by inserting lines in the selection table.
    
-   If start values are specified, these must have the internal format of the ABAP values, and not the output format of the screen display.
    

Addition 2

... LOWER CASE

Effect

This addition prevents the content of character-like fields from being converted to block capitals when the data is transported from the input fields on the selection screen to the selection table.

Addition 3

... MATCHCODE OBJECT search\_help

Effect

This addition associates the input fields for the selection criterion with a search help search\_help from ABAP Dictionary. The name of the search help must be specified directly. The addition has the same effect on the input fields as when it is used with a [PARAMETERS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapparameters_value.htm) statement for an input field for a parameter.

Addition 4

... MEMORY ID pid

Effect

This addition associates the first input field with an [SPA/GPA parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenspa_gpa_parameter_1_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in the [user memory](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenuser_memory_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The ID pid of the SPA/GPA parameter must be specified directly and it can contain a maximum of 20 characters. The addition has the same effect on the first input field as when it is used with a [PARAMETERS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapparameters_value.htm) statement for an input field for a parameter.

If the specified ID pid is not in the database table TPARA, the extended program check reports an error.

Selection Screens, Default Values for Selection Criteria

The example shows which default values you can set for selection criteria.

Source Code

REPORT demo\_sel\_screen\_select\_default.
DATA wa\_spfli TYPE spfli.
SELECT-OPTIONS airline FOR wa\_spfli-carrid
               DEFAULT 'AA'
                    TO 'LH'
                OPTION  nb
                  SIGN  i.

Description

The symbol before the first field indicates that the field airline-option contains the operator NB. The green colour indicates that the field airline-sign contains the value "I". The arrow on the right pushbutton is not green since only one line of the selection table is filled.

This addition associates the first input field with an [SPA/GPA parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenspa_gpa_parameter_1_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in the [user memory](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenuser_memory_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The ID pid of the SPA/GPA parameter must be specified directly and it can contain a maximum of 20 characters. The addition has the same effect on the first input field as when it is used with a [PARAMETERS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapparameters_value.htm) statement for an input field for a parameter.

If the specified ID pid is not in the database table TPARA, the extended program check reports an error.

Effect

This declares a selection criterion selcrit for a data object dobj or a type specified in name. Selection criteria are components of a [selection screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_screen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), to which are assigned a [selection table](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in the ABAP program, as well as two input fields and a pushbutton for multiple selection.

The name of the selection criterion selcrit is limited to a maximum of 8 characters. This statement is allowed in the global declaration part of [executable programs](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenexecutable_program_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), [function groups](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenfunction_group_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), and [module pools](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenmodul_pool_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). In function groups and module pools, the statement is only allowed within the definition of a [standalone selection screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselection-screen_definition.htm). In executable programs, the statement is otherwise automatically assigned to the [standard selection screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselection-screen_standard.htm).

The statement SELECT-OPTIONS has the following effect:

-   The statement declares a selection table in the program with the name selcrit. A selection table is an internal [standard table](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenstandard_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") with [header line](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenheader_line_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and [standard key](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenstandard_key_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). In selection tables, multiple selection conditions can be saved. The content of selection tables can be analyzed in a [relational expression](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenrelational_expression_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") with the [relational operator](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenrelational_operator_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [IN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenlogexp_select_option.htm) or in a [similar expression](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenwhere_logexp_seltab.htm) of a WHERE condition in Open SQL. Selection tables have the following four columns:
    

-   sign of type c and length 1. The content of sign determines for every row whether the result of the condition formulated in the column is included or excluded in the entire resulting set for all rows. Valid values are "I" for include and "E" for exclude.

-   option of type c with length 2. option contains the selection option for the condition of the row in the form of relational operators. Valid operators are "EQ", "NE", "GE", "GT", "LE", "LT", "CP", and "NP", if the column high is initial, and "BT", "NB", if column high is not initial. For the options "CP" and "NP", the data type of the columns low and high must be c, and special rules apply to entries on the selection screen.

-   low of the data type defined after [FOR](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_for.htm). This column is designated for the comparison value or the lower interval limitation.

-   high of the data type defined after [FOR](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_for.htm). This column is designated for the upper interval limitation.

-   Two input fields with the name selcrit-low and selcrit-high are created on the current selection screen using a matching external data type in a new row at positions 35 and 60. The length of the input fields is based upon the length of the data type which is defined after FOR. The maximum length of the input fields is 255. The maximum visible length of the input fields is between 10 and 18 (depending on the nesting depth in framed blocks). If the length is greater than the maximum visible length, the content is displayed as movable.
    An output field generated automatically is displayed in the first position available to the left of the input field as a label with a length of between 20 and 30 depending on the nesting depth in blocks with frames. The output field contains either the name of the selcrit selection criterion or the selection text to which the selection criterion is assigned in the text elements of the program. If the user requests field or input help on the output field using the function key F1 or F4, the same output is displayed as if one of the input fields is chosen.
    A multiple selection pushbutton is created after the second input field. If this pushbutton is selected, a dialog screen with four [tabstrip control pages](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentab_page_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") appears, in which the input fields are again displayed in tabular form in [Table Controls](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentable_control_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The tabstrip pages are separated based on individual value comparison, interval limitation, and settings for the column sign.
    Users can select an input field with a double-click on the selection screen or use the dialog screen for multiple selection. On the selection screen, the value of the column sign can also be chosen. On the dialog screen for multiple selection, this is done by selecting the respective tabstrip page. If the selection option is not equal to "EQ" or "BT", it is displayed as an icon in front of the first input field. The color of the icon is green if the content of the column sign is "I", and red if it is "E".
    The selection options "CP" and "NP" can be selected only if the first input field contains one of the wildcard characters "\*" or "+". "+" masks a single character, "\*" masks any character string, even an empty one. If one of these characters is entered, the selection option is automatically set to "CP". If "CP" is set, and all wildcard characters have been removed, the selection option is automatically set to "EQ" when there is a user action. This limitation does not apply within the program. When the selection table is evaluated, the column low can also contain a string without wildcard characters for the selection options "CP" and "NP".
    The attributes of the elements on the selection screen can be influenced with the statement [screen\_options](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_screen.htm) or the statement [SELECTION-SCREEN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselection-screen.htm).
    
-   The first row of the selection table selcrit is associated with the input fields on the selection screen. All rows are displayed in the dialog box for multiple selection.
    Each time before the selection screen is sent to the [selection screen event](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_screen_event_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") ATSELECTION-SCREEN OUTPUT, the content of first row in the selection table is transported to the selection screen, with a [conversion routine](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenconversion_routine_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") being executed if required. If the length of the columns low and high in the first row of the selection table is greater than 255, the surplus content is cut off on the right. It is only possible for all rows to be transported if the button for multiple selections is selected. A conversion routine might be executed here, and rows might be cut off. Settings for the content of the input fields can be made in [value\_options](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_value.htm).
    After a user action on the selection screen, the contents of the input fields and the chosen settings are transported to the first row and the header row of the selection table.
    After a user action on the dialog box for multiple selections, the contents of all input fields and the chosen settings are transported to the rows of the selection table. During these transports, the contents of character-type fields are converted by default into capitals, after which a conversion routine is performed, if required. After each transport, various [selection screen events](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapat_selection-screen_events.htm) are raised.
    If a value has been entered in the entry field for the upper interval high, the system checks whether this value is greater than the lower interval limit low following each transport and conversion routine (if performed). If necessary, an [error message](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenerror_message_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is sent. This check can be switched off before the selection screen is sent, using the function module RS\_SELOPT\_NO\_INTERVAL\_CHECK.
    
-   If selection criteria are defined in the selection include of a logical database, further additions [ldb\_options](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_ldb.htm) are necessary or possible.
    
-   If, in an executable program, a selection criterion is defined for a component of a node of the associated logical database, declared by [TABLES](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abaptables.htm) or [NODES](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapnodes.htm), and the node in question is intended for dynamic selection on the logical database, the selection table is passed (by default) to the logical database, after [selection screen processing](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselscreen_processing_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), where it is handled as a dynamic selection. Furthermore, in this case, the input fields for the corresponding dynamic selection are displayed directly on the selection screen. Therefore the user does not need to select the fields using the Dynamic Selections function. This transfer can be suppressed using the addition [NO DATABASE SELECTION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_no_db_sel.htm).
    

Notes

-   To avoid undefined system behavior, the header row of a selection table should not be changed in the program. Read access should also be avoided. Instead separate work areas, field symbols, or data references should be used, as always for internal tables.
    
-   If a selection criterion is supplied with data when calling up an executable program using [SUBMIT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapsubmit.htm), a [conversion routine](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenconversion_routine_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") may be performed for the first row only, while the value of the columns low and high will be truncated at position 255 for the first row only. If the selection criterion is declared with the addition [NO-DISPLAY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_screen.htm), no conversion routine or truncation will be performed for the first row either.
    
-   If the type of the selection criterion is a [decimal floating point number](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendecfloat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that does not refer to a data type in ABAP Dictionary, the output style preserve scaling is set for the input field of the selection screen. Here, any trailing zeroes are preserved in the decimal places. If there is a reference to a data type in the ABAP Dictionary, the output style defined there is used.
    
-   If the type of the selection criteria is a [packed number](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenpacked_number_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or a [decimal floating point number](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendecfloat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") defined in ABAP Dictionary, the attribute sign must be set for the type attribute, so that negative numbers can be displayed on the selection screen. This setting is only possible for [domains](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendomain_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and not for specifying a built-in type directly for [data elements](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendata_element_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or structure components. If a negative number is entered on the selection screen and this property is not set, the system rejects it with an error message. If the columns low or high contain a negative number when the selection screen is called, an non-handleable exception is raised.
    
-   If the type of the selection criterion is a [decimal floating point number](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendecfloat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") defined in ABAP Dictionary for which the output style "currency amount" is specified, only numbers with the corresponding amount of decimal places can be entered on the selection screen. If a corresponding ABAP data object contains a number with too many decimal places when the selection screen is called, a non-handleable exception is raised. If the output style is "extended currency amount", additional decimal places can be displayed.
    
-   The columns sign and option of a selection table declared using SELECT-OPTIONS are not related to data types in ABAP Dictionary. In the case of [ranges tables](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenranges_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") defined in ABAP Dictionary, these columns refer to the data elements DDSIGN and DDOPTION.

SELECT-OPTIONS - FOR

[Quick Reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_shortref.htm)

Syntax

... FOR *{*dobj*|*(name)*}* ...

Alternatives:

[1\. ... FOR dobj](#!ABAP_ALTERNATIVE_1@1@)
[2\. ... FOR (name)](#!ABAP_ALTERNATIVE_2@2@)

Effect

This addition determines the data type of the columns low and high in the [selection table](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The data type can be defined by means of a static reference to an existing data object dobj or by a dynamic reference to a data type from ABAP Dictionary in name.

If the addition [NO-DISPLAY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_screen.htm) is not specified, the data type of the columns low and high in the selection table must be elementary and [flat](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenflat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and the numeric type f is not allowed. If the addition NO-DISPLAY is specified, any data types, except [enumerated types](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenenumerated_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), are possible.

Note

When referencing data types from ABAP Dictionary, the [selection criterion](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_criterion_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") inherits all the screen-relevant attributes defined there. During data transport to and from the input fields, any conversion routines defined in the domain are executed. The text defined in ABAP Dictionary can be inherited as a selection text. Note, however, that the input fields on the selection screen are associated with a global data object belonging to the program and do not have any real reference to the dictionary, in contrast to dynpro fields, which are created in Screen Painter with reference to the dictionary. This has a particular effect on automatic support for input help (F4) and value checking. In comparison with general dynpros, input help functions are limited here in that dependencies between fields and previously entered data are ignored. No automatic value checking is performed.

Alternative 1

... FOR dobj

Effect

If this addition is specified, the columns low and high in the selection table inherit all the attributes of a data object dobj that has already been declared, most importantly a reference to ABAP Dictionary, if applicable. dobj expects a data object that is elementary and flat and not of the type f (unless [NO-DISPLAY is used](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_screen.htm)) and is not an [enumerated type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenenumerated_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Note

As well as the data objects referred to using FOR from their own program, the public attributes of global classes are also relevant data objects.

Example

Typical declaration and application of a selection criterion.

DATA spfli\_wa TYPE spfli.
SELECT-OPTIONS s\_carrid FOR spfli\_wa-carrid.
SELECT \*
       FROM spfli
       WHERE carrid IN @s\_carrid
       INTO @spfli\_wa.
  ...
ENDSELECT.

Alternative 2

... FOR (name)

Effect

This addition is used to create the columns low and high in the selection table with data type c and length 45. The input fields are displayed on the selection screen, but with a length, field help, and input help appropriate for the data type specified in name.

name expects a [flat](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenflat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") character-like data object that contains the name of a component in a flat structure from ABAP Dictionary in uppercase letters when the selection screen is accessed. The following can be specified for name:

-   Constant

If the data object name is specified as a constant, it can be evaluated statically and the specified component is identified as the used object.

-   Variable

If the data object name is specified as a variable, it is specified only dynamically and the content is not evaluated statically.

A text field literal can be specified for name, but its content is ignored. If the [text pool](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentext_pool_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") currently loaded does not contain a selection text for the parameter, the output field displays the corresponding field label from ABAP Dictionary. When data is transported from the input field to the selection table, the content is converted as if it were assigned by the corresponding ABAP data type (no formatting characters, period as a decimal separator, date format "yyyymmdd", and so on).

If the content of name is not a structure component in ABAP Dictionary, the input fields are displayed according to the actual type of the columns low and high. This also applies if a literal is specified for name. If a selection text for the parameter is not created in the text pool currently loaded, the output field contains the text "Generic Selection Option".

A dynamic reference to a data type is not possible in a selection include for a [logical database](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenlogical_data_base_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Example

Dynamic design of the selection criterion selcrit on selection screen 500 based on the entries in the [standard selection screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenstandard_selscreen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") for an executable program.

PARAMETERS: dbtab  TYPE c LENGTH 30,
            column TYPE c LENGTH 30.
DATA name(80) TYPE c.
SELECTION-SCREEN BEGIN OF SCREEN 500 AS WINDOW.
SELECT-OPTIONS selcrit FOR (name).
SELECTION-SCREEN END OF SCREEN 500.
name = dbtab && '-' && column.
CALL SELECTION-SCREEN 500 STARTING AT 10 10.

Description

On the selection screen 100, the name of the table dbtab and its column column can be specified. These are then used for the dynamic layout of the selection criterion on the selection screen 500.

Two input fields and a pushbutton to enter additional values for the selection criterion are displayed. The value which the user enters in the first input field is written to the component selcrit-low of the selection table; the value for the second field is written to the component selcrit-high.

For more complex selections, the user can use the pushbutton on the right side of the selection screen to display the GUI window for multiple selections.

The contents of the selection table are then shown in a list. The first column determines whether the subsequent values are to be included or not; the second contains the Boolean operator and the last two columns contain the limits low and high.

SELECT-OPTIONS - FOR

[Quick Reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_shortref.htm)

Syntax

... FOR *{*dobj*|*(name)*}* ...

Alternatives:

[1\. ... FOR dobj](#!ABAP_ALTERNATIVE_1@1@)
[2\. ... FOR (name)](#!ABAP_ALTERNATIVE_2@2@)

Effect

This addition determines the data type of the columns low and high in the [selection table](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The data type can be defined by means of a static reference to an existing data object dobj or by a dynamic reference to a data type from ABAP Dictionary in name.

If the addition [NO-DISPLAY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_screen.htm) is not specified, the data type of the columns low and high in the selection table must be elementary and [flat](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenflat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and the numeric type f is not allowed. If the addition NO-DISPLAY is specified, any data types, except [enumerated types](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenenumerated_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), are possible.

Note

When referencing data types from ABAP Dictionary, the [selection criterion](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_criterion_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") inherits all the screen-relevant attributes defined there. During data transport to and from the input fields, any conversion routines defined in the domain are executed. The text defined in ABAP Dictionary can be inherited as a selection text. Note, however, that the input fields on the selection screen are associated with a global data object belonging to the program and do not have any real reference to the dictionary, in contrast to dynpro fields, which are created in Screen Painter with reference to the dictionary. This has a particular effect on automatic support for input help (F4) and value checking. In comparison with general dynpros, input help functions are limited here in that dependencies between fields and previously entered data are ignored. No automatic value checking is performed.

Alternative 1

... FOR dobj

Effect

If this addition is specified, the columns low and high in the selection table inherit all the attributes of a data object dobj that has already been declared, most importantly a reference to ABAP Dictionary, if applicable. dobj expects a data object that is elementary and flat and not of the type f (unless [NO-DISPLAY is used](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_screen.htm)) and is not an [enumerated type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenenumerated_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Note

As well as the data objects referred to using FOR from their own program, the public attributes of global classes are also relevant data objects.

Example

Typical declaration and application of a selection criterion.

DATA spfli\_wa TYPE spfli.
SELECT-OPTIONS s\_carrid FOR spfli\_wa-carrid.
SELECT \*
       FROM spfli
       WHERE carrid IN @s\_carrid
       INTO @spfli\_wa.
  ...
ENDSELECT.

Alternative 2

... FOR (name)

Effect

This addition is used to create the columns low and high in the selection table with data type c and length 45. The input fields are displayed on the selection screen, but with a length, field help, and input help appropriate for the data type specified in name.

name expects a [flat](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenflat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") character-like data object that contains the name of a component in a flat structure from ABAP Dictionary in uppercase letters when the selection screen is accessed. The following can be specified for name:

-   Constant

If the data object name is specified as a constant, it can be evaluated statically and the specified component is identified as the used object.

-   Variable

If the data object name is specified as a variable, it is specified only dynamically and the content is not evaluated statically.

A text field literal can be specified for name, but its content is ignored. If the [text pool](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentext_pool_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") currently loaded does not contain a selection text for the parameter, the output field displays the corresponding field label from ABAP Dictionary. When data is transported from the input field to the selection table, the content is converted as if it were assigned by the corresponding ABAP data type (no formatting characters, period as a decimal separator, date format "yyyymmdd", and so on).

If the content of name is not a structure component in ABAP Dictionary, the input fields are displayed according to the actual type of the columns low and high. This also applies if a literal is specified for name. If a selection text for the parameter is not created in the text pool currently loaded, the output field contains the text "Generic Selection Option".

A dynamic reference to a data type is not possible in a selection include for a [logical database](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenlogical_data_base_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Example

Dynamic design of the selection criterion selcrit on selection screen 500 based on the entries in the [standard selection screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenstandard_selscreen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") for an executable program.

PARAMETERS: dbtab  TYPE c LENGTH 30,
            column TYPE c LENGTH 30.
DATA name(80) TYPE c.
SELECTION-SCREEN BEGIN OF SCREEN 500 AS WINDOW.
SELECT-OPTIONS selcrit FOR (name).
SELECTION-SCREEN END OF SCREEN 500.
name = dbtab && '-' && column.
CALL SELECTION-SCREEN 500 STARTING AT 10 10.

[4\. ... NO-EXTENSION](#!ABAP_ADDITION_4@4@)
[5\. ... NO INTERVALS](#!ABAP_ADDITION_5@5@)

Effect

These additions can be used to declare the first input field as a mandatory field, hide the input field on the [selection screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_screen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), and define the visible length of the field. The display of the second input field and the pushbutton for multiple selection can be suppressed. The addition [MODIF ID](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselection-screen_modif_id.htm) assigns all screen elements of the [selection criterion](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_criterion_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") to the [modification group](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenmodification_group_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") modid.

Note

As well as the additions already available, the function module SELECT\_OPTIONS\_RESTRICT can also be used to restrict the number of selection options offered and prohibit the value "E" for the column sign in the [selection table](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") before the selection screen is sent.

Addition 1

... OBLIGATORY

Effect

This addition defines the first input field for the selection criterion on the selection screen as a mandatory field. If this field is blank, the user cannot exit the selection screen using the Execute function (F8) and can only use the Back, Exit, or Cancel functions.

Addition 2

... NO-DISPLAY

Effect

If this addition is specified, no screen elements are created on the selection screen for the selection criterion. In an [executable program](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenexecutable_program_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), a selection criterion of this type is used exclusively as part of the interface defined by the selection screen. It can be supplied with a value by the calling program when it is called with [SUBMIT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapsubmit.htm).

If the addition NO-DISPLAY is specified, the low and high columns in the selection table can have any [flat](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenflat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") data types. These selection tables can only be supplied with data using the addition [WITH](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapsubmit_selscreen_parameters.htm) of the statement SUBMIT.

Note

The length of the values passed to the columns low and high in the selection table, for which there is no input field, is not restricted to 45 characters, as is the case for selection criteria with input fields.

Addition 3

... VISIBLE LENGTH vlen

Effect

This addition defines the visible length of the input field as vlen, where vlen is entered directly as a positive number. If vlen is shorter than the length of columns low and high in the selection table and shorter than the maximum visible length, it is possible to scroll in the input field, which is displayed with the length of vlen. Otherwise, the addition is ignored.

Addition 4

... NO-EXTENSION

Effect

If this addition is specified, the pushbutton for multiple selection is not created on the [selection screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_screen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Note

The user cannot access the dialog box for multiple selection on the selection screen, which means that he or she cannot edit [selection tables](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") containing multiple rows.

Addition 5

... NO INTERVALS

Effect

If this addition is specified, the second input field is not created on the selection screen.

Note

The user can only specify a single comparison in the first row of the selection table on the selection screen. Intervals can still be selected in the dialog box for multiple selection.

Example

Declaration of a selection criterion for which a single comparison is possible on the selection screen, but multiple selection is not possible.

DATA spfli\_wa TYPE spfli.
SELECT-OPTIONS s\_carrid FOR spfli\_wa-carrid NO-EXTENSION
                                            NO INTERVALS.

[3\. ... MATCHCODE OBJECT search\_help](#!ABAP_ADDITION_3@3@)
[4\. ... MEMORY ID pid](#!ABAP_ADDITION_4@4@)

Effect

These additions allow a start value to be specified, allow lowercase, and integrate a search help or a [SPA/GPA parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenspa_gpa_parameter_1_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Addition 1

... DEFAULT val1 *\[*TO val2*\]* *\[*OPTION opt*\]* *\[*SIGN sgn*\]*

Effect

This addition defines [start values](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenstart_value_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") for the columns in the first row of the [selection table](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). Without the addition DEFAULT, type-dependent [initial values](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abeninitial_value_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") are used as start values.

val1 and val2 are used to define start values for columns low and high. These start values can either be specified as literals or as previously defined data objects. If the data type of the specified start values does not match the data type of the columns, these are converted according to the conversion rules.

The addition OPTION is used to define the start value for the option column. If the addition TO is not specified, one of the expressions eq, ne, ge, gt, le, lt, cp, or np must be specified directly for opt. If the addition TO is specified, either specify bt or nb must be specified. If the addition OPTION is not used, the content of the option column is set to ""EQ" or "BT". If specify cp or np are specified, the start value in val1 must contain at least one of the wildcard characters "\*" or "+" when data is passed to the selection table, otherwise the program terminates.

The addition SIGN is used to define the start value for the sign column. Either i or e must be specified directly for sgn. If the addition SIGN is not used, the content of column sign is changed to "I".

The times at which the start values are passed to the first position in the selection table are processed in the same way as with the addition DEFAULT to the [PARAMETERS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapparameters_value.htm) statement. If the selection table is not empty when the transfer takes place, the start values are not transferred to the first position. Only the [header line](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenheader_line_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in the selection table is filled with these values, which does not influence the [selection criterion](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_criterion_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Notes

-   The associated input fields on the [selection screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_screen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") are only filled with the start values if the first row in the selection table is not changed before the selection screen is sent. The system displays the value contained in the selection table when the event [AT SELECTION-SCREEN OUTPUT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapat_selection-screen.htm) has been processed. Start values for multiple selection can only be defined by inserting lines in the selection table.
    
-   If start values are specified, these must have the internal format of the ABAP values, and not the output format of the screen display.
    

Addition 2

... LOWER CASE

Effect

This addition prevents the content of character-like fields from being converted to block capitals when the data is transported from the input fields on the selection screen to the selection table.

Addition 3

... MATCHCODE OBJECT search\_help

Effect

This addition associates the input fields for the selection criterion with a search help search\_help from ABAP Dictionary. The name of the search help must be specified directly. The addition has the same effect on the input fields as when it is used with a [PARAMETERS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapparameters_value.htm) statement for an input field for a parameter.

Addition 4

... MEMORY ID pid

Effect

This addition associates the first input field with an [SPA/GPA parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenspa_gpa_parameter_1_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in the [user memory](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenuser_memory_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The ID pid of the SPA/GPA parameter must be specified directly and it can contain a maximum of 20 characters. The addition has the same effect on the first input field as when it is used with a [PARAMETERS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapparameters_value.htm) statement for an input field for a parameter.

If the specified ID pid is not in the database table TPARA, the extended program check reports an error.

Selection Screens, Default Values for Selection Criteria

The example shows which default values you can set for selection criteria.

Source Code

REPORT demo\_sel\_screen\_select\_default.
DATA wa\_spfli TYPE spfli.
SELECT-OPTIONS airline FOR wa\_spfli-carrid
               DEFAULT 'AA'
                    TO 'LH'
                OPTION  nb
                  SIGN  i.

Description

The symbol before the first field indicates that the field airline-option contains the operator NB. The green colour indicates that the field airline-sign contains the value "I". The arrow on the right pushbutton is not green since only one line of the selection table is filled.

Effect

These additions allow a start value to be specified, allow lowercase, and integrate a search help or a [SPA/GPA parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenspa_gpa_parameter_1_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Addition 1

... DEFAULT val1 *\[*TO val2*\]* *\[*OPTION opt*\]* *\[*SIGN sgn*\]*

Effect

This addition defines [start values](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenstart_value_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") for the columns in the first row of the [selection table](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). Without the addition DEFAULT, type-dependent [initial values](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abeninitial_value_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") are used as start values.

val1 and val2 are used to define start values for columns low and high. These start values can either be specified as literals or as previously defined data objects. If the data type of the specified start values does not match the data type of the columns, these are converted according to the conversion rules.

The addition OPTION is used to define the start value for the option column. If the addition TO is not specified, one of the expressions eq, ne, ge, gt, le, lt, cp, or np must be specified directly for opt. If the addition TO is specified, either specify bt or nb must be specified. If the addition OPTION is not used, the content of the option column is set to ""EQ" or "BT". If specify cp or np are specified, the start value in val1 must contain at least one of the wildcard characters "\*" or "+" when data is passed to the selection table, otherwise the program terminates.

The addition SIGN is used to define the start value for the sign column. Either i or e must be specified directly for sgn. If the addition SIGN is not used, the content of column sign is changed to "I".

The times at which the start values are passed to the first position in the selection table are processed in the same way as with the addition DEFAULT to the [PARAMETERS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapparameters_value.htm) statement. If the selection table is not empty when the transfer takes place, the start values are not transferred to the first position. Only the [header line](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenheader_line_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in the selection table is filled with these values, which does not influence the [selection criterion](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_criterion_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Notes

-   The associated input fields on the [selection screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_screen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") are only filled with the start values if the first row in the selection table is not changed before the selection screen is sent. The system displays the value contained in the selection table when the event [AT SELECTION-SCREEN OUTPUT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapat_selection-screen.htm) has been processed. Start values for multiple selection can only be defined by inserting lines in the selection table.
    
-   If start values are specified, these must have the internal format of the ABAP values, and not the output format of the screen display.
    

Addition 2

... LOWER CASE

Effect

This addition prevents the content of character-like fields from being converted to block capitals when the data is transported from the input fields on the selection screen to the selection table.

Addition 3

... MATCHCODE OBJECT search\_help

Effect

This addition associates the input fields for the selection criterion with a search help search\_help from ABAP Dictionary. The name of the search help must be specified directly. The addition has the same effect on the input fields as when it is used with a [PARAMETERS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapparameters_value.htm) statement for an input field for a parameter.

Addition 4

... MEMORY ID pid

Effect

This addition associates the first input field with an [SPA/GPA parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenspa_gpa_parameter_1_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in the [user memory](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenuser_memory_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The ID pid of the SPA/GPA parameter must be specified directly and it can contain a maximum of 20 characters. The addition has the same effect on the first input field as when it is used with a [PARAMETERS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapparameters_value.htm) statement for an input field for a parameter.

If the specified ID pid is not in the database table TPARA, the extended program check reports an error.

Effect

This declares a selection criterion selcrit for a data object dobj or a type specified in name. Selection criteria are components of a [selection screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_screen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), to which are assigned a [selection table](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in the ABAP program, as well as two input fields and a pushbutton for multiple selection.

The name of the selection criterion selcrit is limited to a maximum of 8 characters. This statement is allowed in the global declaration part of [executable programs](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenexecutable_program_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), [function groups](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenfunction_group_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), and [module pools](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenmodul_pool_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). In function groups and module pools, the statement is only allowed within the definition of a [standalone selection screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselection-screen_definition.htm). In executable programs, the statement is otherwise automatically assigned to the [standard selection screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselection-screen_standard.htm).

The statement SELECT-OPTIONS has the following effect:

-   The statement declares a selection table in the program with the name selcrit. A selection table is an internal [standard table](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenstandard_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") with [header line](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenheader_line_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and [standard key](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenstandard_key_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). In selection tables, multiple selection conditions can be saved. The content of selection tables can be analyzed in a [relational expression](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenrelational_expression_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") with the [relational operator](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenrelational_operator_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [IN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenlogexp_select_option.htm) or in a [similar expression](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenwhere_logexp_seltab.htm) of a WHERE condition in Open SQL. Selection tables have the following four columns:
    

-   sign of type c and length 1. The content of sign determines for every row whether the result of the condition formulated in the column is included or excluded in the entire resulting set for all rows. Valid values are "I" for include and "E" for exclude.

-   option of type c with length 2. option contains the selection option for the condition of the row in the form of relational operators. Valid operators are "EQ", "NE", "GE", "GT", "LE", "LT", "CP", and "NP", if the column high is initial, and "BT", "NB", if column high is not initial. For the options "CP" and "NP", the data type of the columns low and high must be c, and special rules apply to entries on the selection screen.

-   low of the data type defined after [FOR](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_for.htm). This column is designated for the comparison value or the lower interval limitation.

-   high of the data type defined after [FOR](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_for.htm). This column is designated for the upper interval limitation.

-   Two input fields with the name selcrit-low and selcrit-high are created on the current selection screen using a matching external data type in a new row at positions 35 and 60. The length of the input fields is based upon the length of the data type which is defined after FOR. The maximum length of the input fields is 255. The maximum visible length of the input fields is between 10 and 18 (depending on the nesting depth in framed blocks). If the length is greater than the maximum visible length, the content is displayed as movable.
    An output field generated automatically is displayed in the first position available to the left of the input field as a label with a length of between 20 and 30 depending on the nesting depth in blocks with frames. The output field contains either the name of the selcrit selection criterion or the selection text to which the selection criterion is assigned in the text elements of the program. If the user requests field or input help on the output field using the function key F1 or F4, the same output is displayed as if one of the input fields is chosen.
    A multiple selection pushbutton is created after the second input field. If this pushbutton is selected, a dialog screen with four [tabstrip control pages](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentab_page_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") appears, in which the input fields are again displayed in tabular form in [Table Controls](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentable_control_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The tabstrip pages are separated based on individual value comparison, interval limitation, and settings for the column sign.
    Users can select an input field with a double-click on the selection screen or use the dialog screen for multiple selection. On the selection screen, the value of the column sign can also be chosen. On the dialog screen for multiple selection, this is done by selecting the respective tabstrip page. If the selection option is not equal to "EQ" or "BT", it is displayed as an icon in front of the first input field. The color of the icon is green if the content of the column sign is "I", and red if it is "E".
    The selection options "CP" and "NP" can be selected only if the first input field contains one of the wildcard characters "\*" or "+". "+" masks a single character, "\*" masks any character string, even an empty one. If one of these characters is entered, the selection option is automatically set to "CP". If "CP" is set, and all wildcard characters have been removed, the selection option is automatically set to "EQ" when there is a user action. This limitation does not apply within the program. When the selection table is evaluated, the column low can also contain a string without wildcard characters for the selection options "CP" and "NP".
    The attributes of the elements on the selection screen can be influenced with the statement [screen\_options](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_screen.htm) or the statement [SELECTION-SCREEN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselection-screen.htm).
    
-   The first row of the selection table selcrit is associated with the input fields on the selection screen. All rows are displayed in the dialog box for multiple selection.
    Each time before the selection screen is sent to the [selection screen event](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_screen_event_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") ATSELECTION-SCREEN OUTPUT, the content of first row in the selection table is transported to the selection screen, with a [conversion routine](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenconversion_routine_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") being executed if required. If the length of the columns low and high in the first row of the selection table is greater than 255, the surplus content is cut off on the right. It is only possible for all rows to be transported if the button for multiple selections is selected. A conversion routine might be executed here, and rows might be cut off. Settings for the content of the input fields can be made in [value\_options](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_value.htm).
    After a user action on the selection screen, the contents of the input fields and the chosen settings are transported to the first row and the header row of the selection table.
    After a user action on the dialog box for multiple selections, the contents of all input fields and the chosen settings are transported to the rows of the selection table. During these transports, the contents of character-type fields are converted by default into capitals, after which a conversion routine is performed, if required. After each transport, various [selection screen events](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapat_selection-screen_events.htm) are raised.
    If a value has been entered in the entry field for the upper interval high, the system checks whether this value is greater than the lower interval limit low following each transport and conversion routine (if performed). If necessary, an [error message](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenerror_message_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is sent. This check can be switched off before the selection screen is sent, using the function module RS\_SELOPT\_NO\_INTERVAL\_CHECK.
    
-   If selection criteria are defined in the selection include of a logical database, further additions [ldb\_options](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_ldb.htm) are necessary or possible.
    
-   If, in an executable program, a selection criterion is defined for a component of a node of the associated logical database, declared by [TABLES](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abaptables.htm) or [NODES](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapnodes.htm), and the node in question is intended for dynamic selection on the logical database, the selection table is passed (by default) to the logical database, after [selection screen processing](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselscreen_processing_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), where it is handled as a dynamic selection. Furthermore, in this case, the input fields for the corresponding dynamic selection are displayed directly on the selection screen. Therefore the user does not need to select the fields using the Dynamic Selections function. This transfer can be suppressed using the addition [NO DATABASE SELECTION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_no_db_sel.htm).
    

Notes

-   To avoid undefined system behavior, the header row of a selection table should not be changed in the program. Read access should also be avoided. Instead separate work areas, field symbols, or data references should be used, as always for internal tables.
    
-   If a selection criterion is supplied with data when calling up an executable program using [SUBMIT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapsubmit.htm), a [conversion routine](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenconversion_routine_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") may be performed for the first row only, while the value of the columns low and high will be truncated at position 255 for the first row only. If the selection criterion is declared with the addition [NO-DISPLAY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_screen.htm), no conversion routine or truncation will be performed for the first row either.
    
-   If the type of the selection criterion is a [decimal floating point number](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendecfloat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that does not refer to a data type in ABAP Dictionary, the output style preserve scaling is set for the input field of the selection screen. Here, any trailing zeroes are preserved in the decimal places. If there is a reference to a data type in the ABAP Dictionary, the output style defined there is used.
    
-   If the type of the selection criteria is a [packed number](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenpacked_number_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or a [decimal floating point number](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendecfloat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") defined in ABAP Dictionary, the attribute sign must be set for the type attribute, so that negative numbers can be displayed on the selection screen. This setting is only possible for [domains](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendomain_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and not for specifying a built-in type directly for [data elements](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendata_element_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or structure components. If a negative number is entered on the selection screen and this property is not set, the system rejects it with an error message. If the columns low or high contain a negative number when the selection screen is called, an non-handleable exception is raised.
    
-   If the type of the selection criterion is a [decimal floating point number](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendecfloat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") defined in ABAP Dictionary for which the output style "currency amount" is specified, only numbers with the corresponding amount of decimal places can be entered on the selection screen. If a corresponding ABAP data object contains a number with too many decimal places when the selection screen is called, a non-handleable exception is raised. If the output style is "extended currency amount", additional decimal places can be displayed.
    
-   The columns sign and option of a selection table declared using SELECT-OPTIONS are not related to data types in ABAP Dictionary. In the case of [ranges tables](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenranges_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") defined in ABAP Dictionary, these columns refer to the data elements DDSIGN and DDOPTION.

Effect

This addition determines the data type of the columns low and high in the [selection table](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The data type can be defined by means of a static reference to an existing data object dobj or by a dynamic reference to a data type from ABAP Dictionary in name.

If the addition [NO-DISPLAY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_screen.htm) is not specified, the data type of the columns low and high in the selection table must be elementary and [flat](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenflat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and the numeric type f is not allowed. If the addition NO-DISPLAY is specified, any data types, except [enumerated types](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenenumerated_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), are possible.

Note

When referencing data types from ABAP Dictionary, the [selection criterion](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_criterion_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") inherits all the screen-relevant attributes defined there. During data transport to and from the input fields, any conversion routines defined in the domain are executed. The text defined in ABAP Dictionary can be inherited as a selection text. Note, however, that the input fields on the selection screen are associated with a global data object belonging to the program and do not have any real reference to the dictionary, in contrast to dynpro fields, which are created in Screen Painter with reference to the dictionary. This has a particular effect on automatic support for input help (F4) and value checking. In comparison with general dynpros, input help functions are limited here in that dependencies between fields and previously entered data are ignored. No automatic value checking is performed.

Alternative 1

... FOR dobj

Effect

If this addition is specified, the columns low and high in the selection table inherit all the attributes of a data object dobj that has already been declared, most importantly a reference to ABAP Dictionary, if applicable. dobj expects a data object that is elementary and flat and not of the type f (unless [NO-DISPLAY is used](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_screen.htm)) and is not an [enumerated type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenenumerated_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Note

As well as the data objects referred to using FOR from their own program, the public attributes of global classes are also relevant data objects.

Example

Typical declaration and application of a selection criterion.

DATA spfli\_wa TYPE spfli.
SELECT-OPTIONS s\_carrid FOR spfli\_wa-carrid.
SELECT \*
       FROM spfli
       WHERE carrid IN @s\_carrid
       INTO @spfli\_wa.
  ...
ENDSELECT.

Alternative 2

... FOR (name)

Effect

This addition is used to create the columns low and high in the selection table with data type c and length 45. The input fields are displayed on the selection screen, but with a length, field help, and input help appropriate for the data type specified in name.

name expects a [flat](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenflat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") character-like data object that contains the name of a component in a flat structure from ABAP Dictionary in uppercase letters when the selection screen is accessed. The following can be specified for name:

-   Constant

If the data object name is specified as a constant, it can be evaluated statically and the specified component is identified as the used object.

-   Variable

If the data object name is specified as a variable, it is specified only dynamically and the content is not evaluated statically.

A text field literal can be specified for name, but its content is ignored. If the [text pool](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentext_pool_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") currently loaded does not contain a selection text for the parameter, the output field displays the corresponding field label from ABAP Dictionary. When data is transported from the input field to the selection table, the content is converted as if it were assigned by the corresponding ABAP data type (no formatting characters, period as a decimal separator, date format "yyyymmdd", and so on).

If the content of name is not a structure component in ABAP Dictionary, the input fields are displayed according to the actual type of the columns low and high. This also applies if a literal is specified for name. If a selection text for the parameter is not created in the text pool currently loaded, the output field contains the text "Generic Selection Option".

A dynamic reference to a data type is not possible in a selection include for a [logical database](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenlogical_data_base_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Example

Description

On the selection screen 100, the name of the table dbtab and its column column can be specified. These are then used for the dynamic layout of the selection criterion on the selection screen 500.

Two input fields and a pushbutton to enter additional values for the selection criterion are displayed. The value which the user enters in the first input field is written to the component selcrit-low of the selection table; the value for the second field is written to the component selcrit-high.

For more complex selections, the user can use the pushbutton on the right side of the selection screen to display the GUI window for multiple selections.

The contents of the selection table are then shown in a list. The first column determines whether the subsequent values are to be included or not; the second contains the Boolean operator and the last two columns contain the limits low and high.

[4\. ... NO-EXTENSION](#!ABAP_ADDITION_4@4@)
[5\. ... NO INTERVALS](#!ABAP_ADDITION_5@5@)

Effect

These additions can be used to declare the first input field as a mandatory field, hide the input field on the [selection screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_screen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), and define the visible length of the field. The display of the second input field and the pushbutton for multiple selection can be suppressed. The addition [MODIF ID](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselection-screen_modif_id.htm) assigns all screen elements of the [selection criterion](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_criterion_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") to the [modification group](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenmodification_group_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") modid.

Note

As well as the additions already available, the function module SELECT\_OPTIONS\_RESTRICT can also be used to restrict the number of selection options offered and prohibit the value "E" for the column sign in the [selection table](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") before the selection screen is sent.

Addition 1

... OBLIGATORY

Effect

This addition defines the first input field for the selection criterion on the selection screen as a mandatory field. If this field is blank, the user cannot exit the selection screen using the Execute function (F8) and can only use the Back, Exit, or Cancel functions.

Addition 2

... NO-DISPLAY

Effect

If this addition is specified, no screen elements are created on the selection screen for the selection criterion. In an [executable program](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenexecutable_program_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), a selection criterion of this type is used exclusively as part of the interface defined by the selection screen. It can be supplied with a value by the calling program when it is called with [SUBMIT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapsubmit.htm).

If the addition NO-DISPLAY is specified, the low and high columns in the selection table can have any [flat](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenflat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") data types. These selection tables can only be supplied with data using the addition [WITH](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapsubmit_selscreen_parameters.htm) of the statement SUBMIT.

Note

The length of the values passed to the columns low and high in the selection table, for which there is no input field, is not restricted to 45 characters, as is the case for selection criteria with input fields.

Addition 3

... VISIBLE LENGTH vlen

Effect

This addition defines the visible length of the input field as vlen, where vlen is entered directly as a positive number. If vlen is shorter than the length of columns low and high in the selection table and shorter than the maximum visible length, it is possible to scroll in the input field, which is displayed with the length of vlen. Otherwise, the addition is ignored.

Addition 4

... NO-EXTENSION

Effect

If this addition is specified, the pushbutton for multiple selection is not created on the [selection screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_screen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Note

The user cannot access the dialog box for multiple selection on the selection screen, which means that he or she cannot edit [selection tables](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") containing multiple rows.

Addition 5

... NO INTERVALS

Effect

If this addition is specified, the second input field is not created on the selection screen.

Note

The user can only specify a single comparison in the first row of the selection table on the selection screen. Intervals can still be selected in the dialog box for multiple selection.

Example

Declaration of a selection criterion for which a single comparison is possible on the selection screen, but multiple selection is not possible.

DATA spfli\_wa TYPE spfli.
SELECT-OPTIONS s\_carrid FOR spfli\_wa-carrid NO-EXTENSION
                                            NO INTERVALS.

These additions allow a start value to be specified, allow lowercase, and integrate a search help or a [SPA/GPA parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenspa_gpa_parameter_1_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Addition 1

... DEFAULT val1 *\[*TO val2*\]* *\[*OPTION opt*\]* *\[*SIGN sgn*\]*

Effect

This addition defines [start values](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenstart_value_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") for the columns in the first row of the [selection table](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). Without the addition DEFAULT, type-dependent [initial values](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abeninitial_value_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") are used as start values.

val1 and val2 are used to define start values for columns low and high. These start values can either be specified as literals or as previously defined data objects. If the data type of the specified start values does not match the data type of the columns, these are converted according to the conversion rules.

The addition OPTION is used to define the start value for the option column. If the addition TO is not specified, one of the expressions eq, ne, ge, gt, le, lt, cp, or np must be specified directly for opt. If the addition TO is specified, either specify bt or nb must be specified. If the addition OPTION is not used, the content of the option column is set to ""EQ" or "BT". If specify cp or np are specified, the start value in val1 must contain at least one of the wildcard characters "\*" or "+" when data is passed to the selection table, otherwise the program terminates.

The addition SIGN is used to define the start value for the sign column. Either i or e must be specified directly for sgn. If the addition SIGN is not used, the content of column sign is changed to "I".

The times at which the start values are passed to the first position in the selection table are processed in the same way as with the addition DEFAULT to the [PARAMETERS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapparameters_value.htm) statement. If the selection table is not empty when the transfer takes place, the start values are not transferred to the first position. Only the [header line](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenheader_line_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in the selection table is filled with these values, which does not influence the [selection criterion](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_criterion_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Notes

-   The associated input fields on the [selection screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_screen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") are only filled with the start values if the first row in the selection table is not changed before the selection screen is sent. The system displays the value contained in the selection table when the event [AT SELECTION-SCREEN OUTPUT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapat_selection-screen.htm) has been processed. Start values for multiple selection can only be defined by inserting lines in the selection table.
    
-   If start values are specified, these must have the internal format of the ABAP values, and not the output format of the screen display.
    

Addition 2

... LOWER CASE

Effect

This addition prevents the content of character-like fields from being converted to block capitals when the data is transported from the input fields on the selection screen to the selection table.

Addition 3

... MATCHCODE OBJECT search\_help

Effect

This addition associates the input fields for the selection criterion with a search help search\_help from ABAP Dictionary. The name of the search help must be specified directly. The addition has the same effect on the input fields as when it is used with a [PARAMETERS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapparameters_value.htm) statement for an input field for a parameter.

Addition 4

... MEMORY ID pid

Effect

This addition associates the first input field with an [SPA/GPA parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenspa_gpa_parameter_1_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in the [user memory](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenuser_memory_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The ID pid of the SPA/GPA parameter must be specified directly and it can contain a maximum of 20 characters. The addition has the same effect on the first input field as when it is used with a [PARAMETERS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapparameters_value.htm) statement for an input field for a parameter.

If the specified ID pid is not in the database table TPARA, the extended program check reports an error.

Selection Screens, Default Values for Selection Criteria

The example shows which default values you can set for selection criteria.

Source Code

REPORT demo\_sel\_screen\_select\_default.
DATA wa\_spfli TYPE spfli.
SELECT-OPTIONS airline FOR wa\_spfli-carrid
               DEFAULT 'AA'
                    TO 'LH'
                OPTION  nb
                  SIGN  i.

Description

The symbol before the first field indicates that the field airline-option contains the operator NB. The green colour indicates that the field airline-sign contains the value "I". The arrow on the right pushbutton is not green since only one line of the selection table is filled.

Effect

These additions allow a start value to be specified, allow lowercase, and integrate a search help or a [SPA/GPA parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenspa_gpa_parameter_1_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Addition 1

... DEFAULT val1 *\[*TO val2*\]* *\[*OPTION opt*\]* *\[*SIGN sgn*\]*

Effect

This addition defines [start values](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenstart_value_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") for the columns in the first row of the [selection table](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). Without the addition DEFAULT, type-dependent [initial values](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abeninitial_value_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") are used as start values.

val1 and val2 are used to define start values for columns low and high. These start values can either be specified as literals or as previously defined data objects. If the data type of the specified start values does not match the data type of the columns, these are converted according to the conversion rules.

The addition OPTION is used to define the start value for the option column. If the addition TO is not specified, one of the expressions eq, ne, ge, gt, le, lt, cp, or np must be specified directly for opt. If the addition TO is specified, either specify bt or nb must be specified. If the addition OPTION is not used, the content of the option column is set to ""EQ" or "BT". If specify cp or np are specified, the start value in val1 must contain at least one of the wildcard characters "\*" or "+" when data is passed to the selection table, otherwise the program terminates.

The addition SIGN is used to define the start value for the sign column. Either i or e must be specified directly for sgn. If the addition SIGN is not used, the content of column sign is changed to "I".

The times at which the start values are passed to the first position in the selection table are processed in the same way as with the addition DEFAULT to the [PARAMETERS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapparameters_value.htm) statement. If the selection table is not empty when the transfer takes place, the start values are not transferred to the first position. Only the [header line](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenheader_line_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in the selection table is filled with these values, which does not influence the [selection criterion](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_criterion_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Notes

-   The associated input fields on the [selection screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_screen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") are only filled with the start values if the first row in the selection table is not changed before the selection screen is sent.

Effect

This declares a selection criterion selcrit for a data object dobj or a type specified in name. Selection criteria are components of a [selection screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_screen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), to which are assigned a [selection table](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in the ABAP program, as well as two input fields and a pushbutton for multiple selection.

The name of the selection criterion selcrit is limited to a maximum of 8 characters. This statement is allowed in the global declaration part of [executable programs](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenexecutable_program_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), [function groups](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenfunction_group_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), and [module pools](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenmodul_pool_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). In function groups and module pools, the statement is only allowed within the definition of a [standalone selection screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselection-screen_definition.htm). In executable programs, the statement is otherwise automatically assigned to the [standard selection screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselection-screen_standard.htm).

The statement SELECT-OPTIONS has the following effect:

-   The statement declares a selection table in the program with the name selcrit. A selection table is an internal [standard table](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenstandard_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") with [header line](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenheader_line_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and [standard key](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenstandard_key_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). In selection tables, multiple selection conditions can be saved. The content of selection tables can be analyzed in a [relational expression](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenrelational_expression_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") with the [relational operator](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenrelational_operator_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [IN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenlogexp_select_option.htm) or in a [similar expression](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenwhere_logexp_seltab.htm) of a WHERE condition in Open SQL. Selection tables have the following four columns:
    

-   sign of type c and length 1. The content of sign determines for every row whether the result of the condition formulated in the column is included or excluded in the entire resulting set for all rows. Valid values are "I" for include and "E" for exclude.

-   option of type c with length 2. option contains the selection option for the condition of the row in the form of relational operators. Valid operators are "EQ", "NE", "GE", "GT", "LE", "LT", "CP", and "NP", if the column high is initial, and "BT", "NB", if column high is not initial. For the options "CP" and "NP", the data type of the columns low and high must be c, and special rules apply to entries on the selection screen.

-   low of the data type defined after [FOR](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_for.htm). This column is designated for the comparison value or the lower interval limitation.

-   high of the data type defined after [FOR](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_for.htm). This column is designated for the upper interval limitation.

-   Two input fields with the name selcrit-low and selcrit-high are created on the current selection screen using a matching external data type in a new row at positions 35 and 60. The length of the input fields is based upon the length of the data type which is defined after FOR. The maximum length of the input fields is 255. The maximum visible length of the input fields is between 10 and 18 (depending on the nesting depth in framed blocks). If the length is greater than the maximum visible length, the content is displayed as movable.
    An output field generated automatically is displayed in the first position available to the left of the input field as a label with a length of between 20 and 30 depending on the nesting depth in blocks with frames. The output field contains either the name of the selcrit selection criterion or the selection text to which the selection criterion is assigned in the text elements of the program. If the user requests field or input help on the output field using the function key F1 or F4, the same output is displayed as if one of the input fields is chosen.
    A multiple selection pushbutton is created after the second input field. If this pushbutton is selected, a dialog screen with four [tabstrip control pages](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentab_page_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") appears, in which the input fields are again displayed in tabular form in [Table Controls](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentable_control_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The tabstrip pages are separated based on individual value comparison, interval limitation, and settings for the column sign.
    Users can select an input field with a double-click on the selection screen or use the dialog screen for multiple selection. On the selection screen, the value of the column sign can also be chosen. On the dialog screen for multiple selection, this is done by selecting the respective tabstrip page. If the selection option is not equal to "EQ" or "BT", it is displayed as an icon in front of the first input field. The color of the icon is green if the content of the column sign is "I", and red if it is "E".
    The selection options "CP" and "NP" can be selected only if the first input field contains one of the wildcard characters "\*" or "+". "+" masks a single character, "\*" masks any character string, even an empty one. If one of these characters is entered, the selection option is automatically set to "CP". If "CP" is set, and all wildcard characters have been removed, the selection option is automatically set to "EQ" when there is a user action. This limitation does not apply within the program. When the selection table is evaluated, the column low can also contain a string without wildcard characters for the selection options "CP" and "NP".
    The attributes of the elements on the selection screen can be influenced with the statement [screen\_options](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_screen.htm) or the statement [SELECTION-SCREEN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselection-screen.htm).
    
-   The first row of the selection table selcrit is associated with the input fields on the selection screen. All rows are displayed in the dialog box for multiple selection.
    Each time before the selection screen is sent to the [selection screen event](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_screen_event_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") ATSELECTION-SCREEN OUTPUT, the content of first row in the selection table is transported to the selection screen, with a [conversion routine](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenconversion_routine_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") being executed if required. If the length of the columns low and high in the first row of the selection table is greater than 255, the surplus content is cut off on the right. It is only possible for all rows to be transported if the button for multiple selections is selected. A conversion routine might be executed here, and rows might be cut off. Settings for the content of the input fields can be made in [value\_options](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_value.htm).
    After a user action on the selection screen, the contents of the input fields and the chosen settings are transported to the first row and the header row of the selection table.
    After a user action on the dialog box for multiple selections, the contents of all input fields and the chosen settings are transported to the rows of the selection table. During these transports, the contents of character-type fields are converted by default into capitals, after which a conversion routine is performed, if required. After each transport, various [selection screen events](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapat_selection-screen_events.htm) are raised.
    If a value has been entered in the entry field for the upper interval high, the system checks whether this value is greater than the lower interval limit low following each transport and conversion routine (if performed). If necessary, an [error message](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenerror_message_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is sent. This check can be switched off before the selection screen is sent, using the function module RS\_SELOPT\_NO\_INTERVAL\_CHECK.
    
-   If selection criteria are defined in the selection include of a logical database, further additions [ldb\_options](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_ldb.htm) are necessary or possible.
    
-   If, in an executable program, a selection criterion is defined for a component of a node of the associated logical database, declared by [TABLES](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abaptables.htm) or [NODES](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapnodes.htm), and the node in question is intended for dynamic selection on the logical database, the selection table is passed (by default) to the logical database, after [selection screen processing](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselscreen_processing_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), where it is handled as a dynamic selection. Furthermore, in this case, the input fields for the corresponding dynamic selection are displayed directly on the selection screen. Therefore the user does not need to select the fields using the Dynamic Selections function. This transfer can be suppressed using the addition [NO DATABASE SELECTION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_no_db_sel.htm).
    

Notes

-   To avoid undefined system behavior, the header row of a selection table should not be changed in the program. Read access should also be avoided. Instead separate work areas, field symbols, or data references should be used, as always for internal tables.
    
-   If a selection criterion is supplied with data when calling up an executable program using [SUBMIT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapsubmit.htm), a [conversion routine](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenconversion_routine_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") may be performed for the first row only, while the value of the columns low and high will be truncated at position 255 for the first row only. If the selection criterion is declared with the addition [NO-DISPLAY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_screen.htm), no conversion routine or truncation will be performed for the first row either.
    
-   If the type of the selection criterion is a [decimal floating point number](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendecfloat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that does not refer to a data type in ABAP Dictionary, the output style preserve scaling is set for the input field of the selection screen. Here, any trailing zeroes are preserved in the decimal places. If there is a reference to a data type in the ABAP Dictionary, the output style defined there is used.
    
-   If the type of the selection criteria is a [packed number](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenpacked_number_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or a [decimal floating point number](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendecfloat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") defined in ABAP Dictionary, the attribute sign must be set for the type attribute, so that negative numbers can be displayed on the selection screen. This setting is only possible for [domains](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendomain_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and not for specifying a built-in type directly for [data elements](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendata_element_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or structure components. If a negative number is entered on the selection screen and this property is not set, the system rejects it with an error message. If the columns low or high contain a negative number when the selection screen is called, an non-handleable exception is raised.
    
-   If the type of the selection criterion is a [decimal floating point number](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendecfloat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") defined in ABAP Dictionary for which the output style "currency amount" is specified, only numbers with the corresponding amount of decimal places can be entered on the selection screen. If a corresponding ABAP data object contains a number with too many decimal places when the selection screen is called, a non-handleable exception is raised. If the output style is "extended currency amount", additional decimal places can be displayed.
    
-   The columns sign and option of a selection table declared using SELECT-OPTIONS are not related to data types in ABAP Dictionary. In the case of [ranges tables](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenranges_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") defined in ABAP Dictionary, these columns refer to the data elements DDSIGN and DDOPTION.

[Quick Reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_shortref.htm)

Syntax

... FOR *{*dobj*|*(name)*}* ...

Alternatives:

[1\. ... FOR dobj](#!ABAP_ALTERNATIVE_1@1@)
[2\. ... FOR (name)](#!ABAP_ALTERNATIVE_2@2@)

Effect

This addition determines the data type of the columns low and high in the [selection table](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The data type can be defined by means of a static reference to an existing data object dobj or by a dynamic reference to a data type from ABAP Dictionary in name.

If the addition [NO-DISPLAY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_screen.htm) is not specified, the data type of the columns low and high in the selection table must be elementary and [flat](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenflat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and the numeric type f is not allowed. If the addition NO-DISPLAY is specified, any data types, except [enumerated types](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenenumerated_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), are possible.

Note

When referencing data types from ABAP Dictionary, the [selection criterion](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_criterion_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") inherits all the screen-relevant attributes defined there. During data transport to and from the input fields, any conversion routines defined in the domain are executed. The text defined in ABAP Dictionary can be inherited as a selection text. Note, however, that the input fields on the selection screen are associated with a global data object belonging to the program and do not have any real reference to the dictionary, in contrast to dynpro fields, which are created in Screen Painter with reference to the dictionary. This has a particular effect on automatic support for input help (F4) and value checking. In comparison with general dynpros, input help functions are limited here in that dependencies between fields and previously entered data are ignored. No automatic value checking is performed.

Alternative 1

... FOR dobj

Effect

If this addition is specified, the columns low and high in the selection table inherit all the attributes of a data object dobj that has already been declared, most importantly a reference to ABAP Dictionary, if applicable. dobj expects a data object that is elementary and flat and not of the type f (unless [NO-DISPLAY is used](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_screen.htm)) and is not an [enumerated type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenenumerated_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Note

As well as the data objects referred to using FOR from their own program, the public attributes of global classes are also relevant data objects.

Example

Typical declaration and application of a selection criterion.

DATA spfli\_wa TYPE spfli.
SELECT-OPTIONS s\_carrid FOR spfli\_wa-carrid.
SELECT \*
       FROM spfli
       WHERE carrid IN @s\_carrid
       INTO @spfli\_wa.
  ...
ENDSELECT.

Alternative 2

... FOR (name)

Effect

This addition is used to create the columns low and high in the selection table with data type c and length 45. The input fields are displayed on the selection screen, but with a length, field help, and input help appropriate for the data type specified in name.

name expects a [flat](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenflat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") character-like data object that contains the name of a component in a flat structure from ABAP Dictionary in uppercase letters when the selection screen is accessed. The following can be specified for name:

-   Constant

If the data object name is specified as a constant, it can be evaluated statically and the specified component is identified as the used object.

-   Variable

If the data object name is specified as a variable, it is specified only dynamically and the content is not evaluated statically.

A text field literal can be specified for name, but its content is ignored. If the [text pool](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentext_pool_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") currently loaded does not contain a selection text for the parameter, the output field displays the corresponding field label from ABAP Dictionary. When data is transported from the input field to the selection table, the content is converted as if it were assigned by the corresponding ABAP data type (no formatting characters, period as a decimal separator, date format "yyyymmdd", and so on).

If the content of name is not a structure component in ABAP Dictionary, the input fields are displayed according to the actual type of the columns low and high. This also applies if a literal is specified for name. If a selection text for the parameter is not created in the text pool currently loaded, the output field contains the text "Generic Selection Option".

A dynamic reference to a data type is not possible in a selection include for a [logical database](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenlogical_data_base_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Example

Dynamic design of the selection criterion selcrit on selection screen 500 based on the entries in the [standard selection screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenstandard_selscreen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") for an executable program.

Description

On the selection screen 100, the name of the table dbtab and its column column can be specified. These are then used for the dynamic layout of the selection criterion on the selection screen 500.

Two input fields and a pushbutton to enter additional values for the selection criterion are displayed. The value which the user enters in the first input field is written to the component selcrit-low of the selection table; the value for the second field is written to the component selcrit-high.

For more complex selections, the user can use the pushbutton on the right side of the selection screen to display the GUI window for multiple selections.

The contents of the selection table are then shown in a list. The first column determines whether the subsequent values are to be included or not; the second contains the Boolean operator and the last two columns contain the limits low and high.

[5\. ... NO INTERVALS](#!ABAP_ADDITION_5@5@)

Effect

These additions can be used to declare the first input field as a mandatory field, hide the input field on the [selection screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_screen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), and define the visible length of the field. The display of the second input field and the pushbutton for multiple selection can be suppressed. The addition [MODIF ID](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselection-screen_modif_id.htm) assigns all screen elements of the [selection criterion](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_criterion_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") to the [modification group](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenmodification_group_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") modid.

Note

As well as the additions already available, the function module SELECT\_OPTIONS\_RESTRICT can also be used to restrict the number of selection options offered and prohibit the value "E" for the column sign in the [selection table](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") before the selection screen is sent.

Addition 1

... OBLIGATORY

Effect

This addition defines the first input field for the selection criterion on the selection screen as a mandatory field. If this field is blank, the user cannot exit the selection screen using the Execute function (F8) and can only use the Back, Exit, or Cancel functions.

Addition 2

... NO-DISPLAY

Effect

If this addition is specified, no screen elements are created on the selection screen for the selection criterion. In an [executable program](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenexecutable_program_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), a selection criterion of this type is used exclusively as part of the interface defined by the selection screen. It can be supplied with a value by the calling program when it is called with [SUBMIT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapsubmit.htm).

If the addition NO-DISPLAY is specified, the low and high columns in the selection table can have any [flat](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenflat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") data types. These selection tables can only be supplied with data using the addition [WITH](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapsubmit_selscreen_parameters.htm) of the statement SUBMIT.

Note

The length of the values passed to the columns low and high in the selection table, for which there is no input field, is not restricted to 45 characters, as is the case for selection criteria with input fields.

Addition 3

... VISIBLE LENGTH vlen

Effect

This addition defines the visible length of the input field as vlen, where vlen is entered directly as a positive number. If vlen is shorter than the length of columns low and high in the selection table and shorter than the maximum visible length, it is possible to scroll in the input field, which is displayed with the length of vlen. Otherwise, the addition is ignored.

Addition 4

... NO-EXTENSION

Effect

If this addition is specified, the pushbutton for multiple selection is not created on the [selection screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_screen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Note

The user cannot access the dialog box for multiple selection on the selection screen, which means that he or she cannot edit [selection tables](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") containing multiple rows.

Addition 5

... NO INTERVALS

Effect

If this addition is specified, the second input field is not created on the selection screen.

Note

The user can only specify a single comparison in the first row of the selection table on the selection screen. Intervals can still be selected in the dialog box for multiple selection.

Example

Declaration of a selection criterion for which a single comparison is possible on the selection screen, but multiple selection is not possible.

DATA spfli\_wa TYPE spfli.
SELECT-OPTIONS s\_carrid FOR spfli\_wa-carrid NO-EXTENSION
                                            NO INTERVALS.

Effect

These additions allow a start value to be specified, allow lowercase, and integrate a search help or a [SPA/GPA parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenspa_gpa_parameter_1_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Addition 1

... DEFAULT val1 *\[*TO val2*\]* *\[*OPTION opt*\]* *\[*SIGN sgn*\]*

Effect

This addition defines [start values](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenstart_value_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") for the columns in the first row of the [selection table](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). Without the addition DEFAULT, type-dependent [initial values](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abeninitial_value_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") are used as start values.

val1 and val2 are used to define start values for columns low and high. These start values can either be specified as literals or as previously defined data objects. If the data type of the specified start values does not match the data type of the columns, these are converted according to the conversion rules.

The addition OPTION is used to define the start value for the option column. If the addition TO is not specified, one of the expressions eq, ne, ge, gt, le, lt, cp, or np must be specified directly for opt. If the addition TO is specified, either specify bt or nb must be specified. If the addition OPTION is not used, the content of the option column is set to ""EQ" or "BT". If specify cp or np are specified, the start value in val1 must contain at least one of the wildcard characters "\*" or "+" when data is passed to the selection table, otherwise the program terminates.

The addition SIGN is used to define the start value for the sign column. Either i or e must be specified directly for sgn. If the addition SIGN is not used, the content of column sign is changed to "I".

The times at which the start values are passed to the first position in the selection table are processed in the same way as with the addition DEFAULT to the [PARAMETERS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapparameters_value.htm) statement. If the selection table is not empty when the transfer takes place, the start values are not transferred to the first position. Only the [header line](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenheader_line_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in the selection table is filled with these values, which does not influence the [selection criterion](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_criterion_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Notes

-   The associated input fields on the [selection screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_screen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") are only filled with the start values if the first row in the selection table is not changed before the selection screen is sent. The system displays the value contained in the selection table when the event [AT SELECTION-SCREEN OUTPUT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapat_selection-screen.htm) has been processed. Start values for multiple selection can only be defined by inserting lines in the selection table.
    
-   If start values are specified, these must have the internal format of the ABAP values, and not the output format of the screen display.
    

Addition 2

... LOWER CASE

Effect

This addition prevents the content of character-like fields from being converted to block capitals when the data is transported from the input fields on the selection screen to the selection table.

Addition 3

... MATCHCODE OBJECT search\_help

Effect

This addition associates the input fields for the selection criterion with a search help search\_help from ABAP Dictionary. The name of the search help must be specified directly. The addition has the same effect on the input fields as when it is used with a [PARAMETERS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapparameters_value.htm) statement for an input field for a parameter.

Addition 4

... MEMORY ID pid

Effect

This addition associates the first input field with an [SPA/GPA parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenspa_gpa_parameter_1_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in the [user memory](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenuser_memory_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The ID pid of the SPA/GPA parameter must be specified directly and it can contain a maximum of 20 characters. The addition has the same effect on the first input field as when it is used with a [PARAMETERS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapparameters_value.htm) statement for an input field for a parameter.

If the specified ID pid is not in the database table TPARA, the extended program check reports an error.

Selection Screens, Default Values for Selection Criteria

The example shows which default values you can set for selection criteria.

Source Code

REPORT demo\_sel\_screen\_select\_default.
DATA wa\_spfli TYPE spfli.
SELECT-OPTIONS airline FOR wa\_spfli-carrid
               DEFAULT 'AA'
                    TO 'LH'
                OPTION  nb
                  SIGN  i.

Description

The symbol before the first field indicates that the field airline-option contains the operator NB. The green colour indicates that the field airline-sign contains the value "I". The arrow on the right pushbutton is not green since only one line of the selection table is filled.

Effect

This declares a selection criterion selcrit for a data object dobj or a type specified in name. Selection criteria are components of a [selection screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_screen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), to which are assigned a [selection table](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in the ABAP program, as well as two input fields and a pushbutton for multiple selection.

The name of the selection criterion selcrit is limited to a maximum of 8 characters. This statement is allowed in the global declaration part of [executable programs](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenexecutable_program_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), [function groups](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenfunction_group_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), and [module pools](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenmodul_pool_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). In function groups and module pools, the statement is only allowed within the definition of a [standalone selection screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselection-screen_definition.htm). In executable programs, the statement is otherwise automatically assigned to the [standard selection screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselection-screen_standard.htm).

The statement SELECT-OPTIONS has the following effect:

-   The statement declares a selection table in the program with the name selcrit. A selection table is an internal [standard table](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenstandard_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") with [header line](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenheader_line_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and [standard key](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenstandard_key_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). In selection tables, multiple selection conditions can be saved. The content of selection tables can be analyzed in a [relational expression](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenrelational_expression_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") with the [relational operator](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenrelational_operator_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [IN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenlogexp_select_option.htm) or in a [similar expression](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenwhere_logexp_seltab.htm) of a WHERE condition in Open SQL. Selection tables have the following four columns:
    

-   sign of type c and length 1. The content of sign determines for every row whether the result of the condition formulated in the column is included or excluded in the entire resulting set for all rows. Valid values are "I" for include and "E" for exclude.

-   option of type c with length 2. option contains the selection option for the condition of the row in the form of relational operators. Valid operators are "EQ", "NE", "GE", "GT", "LE", "LT", "CP", and "NP", if the column high is initial, and "BT", "NB", if column high is not initial. For the options "CP" and "NP", the data type of the columns low and high must be c, and special rules apply to entries on the selection screen.

-   low of the data type defined after [FOR](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_for.htm). This column is designated for the comparison value or the lower interval limitation.

-   high of the data type defined after [FOR](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_for.htm). This column is designated for the upper interval limitation.

-   Two input fields with the name selcrit-low and selcrit-high are created on the current selection screen using a matching external data type in a new row at positions 35 and 60. The length of the input fields is based upon the length of the data type which is defined after FOR. The maximum length of the input fields is 255. The maximum visible length of the input fields is between 10 and 18 (depending on the nesting depth in framed blocks). If the length is greater than the maximum visible length, the content is displayed as movable.
    An output field generated automatically is displayed in the first position available to the left of the input field as a label with a length of between 20 and 30 depending on the nesting depth in blocks with frames. The output field contains either the name of the selcrit selection criterion or the selection text to which the selection criterion is assigned in the text elements of the program. If the user requests field or input help on the output field using the function key F1 or F4, the same output is displayed as if one of the input fields is chosen.
    A multiple selection pushbutton is created after the second input field. If this pushbutton is selected, a dialog screen with four [tabstrip control pages](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentab_page_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") appears, in which the input fields are again displayed in tabular form in [Table Controls](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentable_control_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The tabstrip pages are separated based on individual value comparison, interval limitation, and settings for the column sign.
    Users can select an input field with a double-click on the selection screen or use the dialog screen for multiple selection. On the selection screen, the value of the column sign can also be chosen. On the dialog screen for multiple selection, this is done by selecting the respective tabstrip page. If the selection option is not equal to "EQ" or "BT", it is displayed as an icon in front of the first input field. The color of the icon is green if the content of the column sign is "I", and red if it is "E".
    The selection options "CP" and "NP" can be selected only if the first input field contains one of the wildcard characters "\*" or "+". "+" masks a single character, "\*" masks any character string, even an empty one. If one of these characters is entered, the selection option is automatically set to "CP". If "CP" is set, and all wildcard characters have been removed, the selection option is automatically set to "EQ" when there is a user action. This limitation does not apply within the program. When the selection table is evaluated, the column low can also contain a string without wildcard characters for the selection options "CP" and "NP".
    The attributes of the elements on the selection screen can be influenced with the statement [screen\_options](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_screen.htm) or the statement [SELECTION-SCREEN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselection-screen.htm).
    
-   The first row of the selection table selcrit is associated with the input fields on the selection screen. All rows are displayed in the dialog box for multiple selection.
    Each time before the selection screen is sent to the [selection screen event](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_screen_event_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") ATSELECTION-SCREEN OUTPUT, the content of first row in the selection table is transported to the selection screen, with a [conversion routine](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenconversion_routine_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") being executed if required. If the length of the columns low and high in the first row of the selection table is greater than 255, the surplus content is cut off on the right. It is only possible for all rows to be transported if the button for multiple selections is selected. A conversion routine might be executed here, and rows might be cut off. Settings for the content of the input fields can be made in [value\_options](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_value.htm).
    After a user action on the selection screen, the contents of the input fields and the chosen settings are transported to the first row and the header row of the selection table.
    After a user action on the dialog box for multiple selections, the contents of all input fields and the chosen settings are transported to the rows of the selection table. During these transports, the contents of character-type fields are converted by default into capitals, after which a conversion routine is performed, if required. After each transport, various [selection screen events](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapat_selection-screen_events.htm) are raised.
    If a value has been entered in the entry field for the upper interval high, the system checks whether this value is greater than the lower interval limit low following each transport and conversion routine (if performed). If necessary, an [error message](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenerror_message_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is sent. This check can be switched off before the selection screen is sent, using the function module RS\_SELOPT\_NO\_INTERVAL\_CHECK.
    
-   If selection criteria are defined in the selection include of a logical database, further additions [ldb\_options](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_ldb.htm) are necessary or possible.
    
-   If, in an executable program, a selection criterion is defined for a component of a node of the associated logical database, declared by [TABLES](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abaptables.htm) or [NODES](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapnodes.htm), and the node in question is intended for dynamic selection on the logical database, the selection table is passed (by default) to the logical database, after [selection screen processing](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselscreen_processing_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), where it is handled as a dynamic selection. Furthermore, in this case, the input fields for the corresponding dynamic selection are displayed directly on the selection screen. Therefore the user does not need to select the fields using the Dynamic Selections function. This transfer can be suppressed using the addition [NO DATABASE SELECTION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_no_db_sel.htm).
    

Notes

-   To avoid undefined system behavior, the header row of a selection table should not be changed in the program. Read access should also be avoided. Instead separate work areas, field symbols, or data references should be used, as always for internal tables.
    
-   If a selection criterion is supplied with data when calling up an executable program using [SUBMIT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapsubmit.htm), a [conversion routine](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenconversion_routine_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") may be performed for the first row only, while the value of the columns low and high will be truncated at position 255 for the first row only. If the selection criterion is declared with the addition [NO-DISPLAY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_screen.htm), no conversion routine or truncation will be performed for the first row either.
    
-   If the type of the selection criterion is a [decimal floating point number](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendecfloat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that does not refer to a data type in ABAP Dictionary, the output style preserve scaling is set for the input field of the selection screen. Here, any trailing zeroes are preserved in the decimal places. If there is a reference to a data type in the ABAP Dictionary, the output style defined there is used.
    
-   If the type of the selection criteria is a [packed number](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenpacked_number_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or a [decimal floating point number](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendecfloat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") defined in ABAP Dictionary, the attribute sign must be set for the type attribute, so that negative numbers can be displayed on the selection screen. This setting is only possible for [domains](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendomain_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and not for specifying a built-in type directly for [data elements](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendata_element_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or structure components. If a negative number is entered on the selection screen and this property is not set, the system rejects it with an error message. If the columns low or high contain a negative number when the selection screen is called, an non-handleable exception is raised.
    
-   If the type of the selection criterion is a [decimal floating point number](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendecfloat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") defined in ABAP Dictionary for which the output style "currency amount" is specified, only numbers with the corresponding amount of decimal places can be entered on the selection screen. If a corresponding ABAP data object contains a number with too many decimal places when the selection screen is called, a non-handleable exception is raised. If the output style is "extended currency amount", additional decimal places can be displayed.
    
-   The columns sign and option of a selection table declared using SELECT-OPTIONS are not related to data types in ABAP Dictionary. In the case of [ranges tables](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenranges_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") defined in ABAP Dictionary, these columns refer to the data elements DDSIGN and DDOPTION.

Syntax

... FOR *{*dobj*|*(name)*}* ...

Alternatives:

[1\. ... FOR dobj](#!ABAP_ALTERNATIVE_1@1@)
[2\. ... FOR (name)](#!ABAP_ALTERNATIVE_2@2@)

Effect

This addition determines the data type of the columns low and high in the [selection table](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The data type can be defined by means of a static reference to an existing data object dobj or by a dynamic reference to a data type from ABAP Dictionary in name.

If the addition [NO-DISPLAY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_screen.htm) is not specified, the data type of the columns low and high in the selection table must be elementary and [flat](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenflat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and the numeric type f is not allowed. If the addition NO-DISPLAY is specified, any data types, except [enumerated types](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenenumerated_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), are possible.

Note

When referencing data types from ABAP Dictionary, the [selection criterion](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_criterion_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") inherits all the screen-relevant attributes defined there. During data transport to and from the input fields, any conversion routines defined in the domain are executed. The text defined in ABAP Dictionary can be inherited as a selection text. Note, however, that the input fields on the selection screen are associated with a global data object belonging to the program and do not have any real reference to the dictionary, in contrast to dynpro fields, which are created in Screen Painter with reference to the dictionary. This has a particular effect on automatic support for input help (F4) and value checking. In comparison with general dynpros, input help functions are limited here in that dependencies between fields and previously entered data are ignored. No automatic value checking is performed.

Alternative 1

... FOR dobj

Effect

If this addition is specified, the columns low and high in the selection table inherit all the attributes of a data object dobj that has already been declared, most importantly a reference to ABAP Dictionary, if applicable. dobj expects a data object that is elementary and flat and not of the type f (unless [NO-DISPLAY is used](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_screen.htm)) and is not an [enumerated type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenenumerated_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Note

As well as the data objects referred to using FOR from their own program, the public attributes of global classes are also relevant data objects.

Example

Typical declaration and application of a selection criterion.

DATA spfli\_wa TYPE spfli.
SELECT-OPTIONS s\_carrid FOR spfli\_wa-carrid.
SELECT \*
       FROM spfli
       WHERE carrid IN @s\_carrid
       INTO @spfli\_wa.
  ...
ENDSELECT.

Alternative 2

... FOR (name)

Effect

This addition is used to create the columns low and high in the selection table with data type c and length 45. The input fields are displayed on the selection screen, but with a length, field help, and input help appropriate for the data type specified in name.

name expects a [flat](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenflat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") character-like data object that contains the name of a component in a flat structure from ABAP Dictionary in uppercase letters when the selection screen is accessed. The following can be specified for name:

-   Constant

If the data object name is specified as a constant, it can be evaluated statically and the specified component is identified as the used object.

-   Variable

If the data object name is specified as a variable, it is specified only dynamically and the content is not evaluated statically.

A text field literal can be specified for name, but its content is ignored. If the [text pool](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentext_pool_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") currently loaded does not contain a selection text for the parameter, the output field displays the corresponding field label from ABAP Dictionary. When data is transported from the input field to the selection table, the content is converted as if it were assigned by the corresponding ABAP data type (no formatting characters, period as a decimal separator, date format "yyyymmdd", and so on).

If the content of name is not a structure component in ABAP Dictionary, the input fields are displayed according to the actual type of the columns low and high. This also applies if a literal is specified for name. If a selection text for the parameter is not created in the text pool currently loaded, the output field contains the text "Generic Selection Option".

A dynamic reference to a data type is not possible in a selection include for a [logical database](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenlogical_data_base_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Example

Dynamic design of the selection criterion selcrit on selection screen 500 based on the entries in the [standard selection screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenstandard_selscreen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") for an executable program.

Description

On the selection screen 100, the name of the table dbtab and its column column can be specified. These are then used for the dynamic layout of the selection criterion on the selection screen 500.

Two input fields and a pushbutton to enter additional values for the selection criterion are displayed. The value which the user enters in the first input field is written to the component selcrit-low of the selection table; the value for the second field is written to the component selcrit-high.

For more complex selections, the user can use the pushbutton on the right side of the selection screen to display the GUI window for multiple selections.

The contents of the selection table are then shown in a list. The first column determines whether the subsequent values are to be included or not; the second contains the Boolean operator and the last two columns contain the limits low and high.

This addition determines the data type of the columns low and high in the [selection table](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The data type can be defined by means of a static reference to an existing data object dobj or by a dynamic reference to a data type from ABAP Dictionary in name.

If the addition [NO-DISPLAY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_screen.htm) is not specified, the data type of the columns low and high in the selection table must be elementary and [flat](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenflat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and the numeric type f is not allowed.

Note

When referencing data types from ABAP Dictionary, the [selection criterion](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_criterion_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") inherits all the screen-relevant attributes defined there.

Effect

This addition is used to create the columns low and high in the selection table with data type c and length 45. The input fields are displayed on the selection screen, but with a length, field help, and input help appropriate for the data type specified in name.

name expects a [flat](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenflat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") character-like data object that contains the name of a component in a flat structure from ABAP Dictionary in uppercase letters when the selection screen is accessed. The following can be specified for name:

-   Constant

If the data object name is specified as a constant, it can be evaluated statically and the specified component is identified as the used object.

-   Variable

If the data object name is specified as a variable, it is specified only dynamically and the content is not evaluated statically.

A text field literal can be specified for name, but its content is ignored. If the [text pool](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentext_pool_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") currently loaded does not contain a selection text for the parameter, the output field displays the corresponding field label from ABAP Dictionary. When data is transported from the input field to the selection table, the content is converted as if it were assigned by the corresponding ABAP data type (no formatting characters, period as a decimal separator, date format "yyyymmdd", and so on).

If the content of name is not a structure component in ABAP Dictionary, the input fields are displayed according to the actual type of the columns low and high. This also applies if a literal is specified for name. If a selection text for the parameter is not created in the text pool currently loaded, the output field contains the text "Generic Selection Option".

A dynamic reference to a data type is not possible in a selection include for a [logical database](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenlogical_data_base_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Example

Dynamic design of the selection criterion selcrit on selection screen 500 based on the entries in the [standard selection screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenstandard_selscreen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") for an executable program.

PARAMETERS: dbtab  TYPE c LENGTH 30,

[4\. ... NO-EXTENSION](#!ABAP_ADDITION_4@4@)
[5\. ... NO INTERVALS](#!ABAP_ADDITION_5@5@)

Effect

These additions can be used to declare the first input field as a mandatory field, hide the input field on the [selection screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_screen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), and define the visible length of the field. The display of the second input field and the pushbutton for multiple selection can be suppressed. The addition [MODIF ID](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselection-screen_modif_id.htm) assigns all screen elements of the [selection criterion](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_criterion_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") to the [modification group](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenmodification_group_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") modid.

Note

As well as the additions already available, the function module SELECT\_OPTIONS\_RESTRICT can also be used to restrict the number of selection options offered and prohibit the value "E" for the column sign in the [selection table](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") before the selection screen is sent.

Addition 1

... OBLIGATORY

Effect

This addition defines the first input field for the selection criterion on the selection screen as a mandatory field. If this field is blank, the user cannot exit the selection screen using the Execute function (F8) and can only use the Back, Exit, or Cancel functions.

Addition 2

... NO-DISPLAY

Effect

If this addition is specified, no screen elements are created on the selection screen for the selection criterion. In an [executable program](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenexecutable_program_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), a selection criterion of this type is used exclusively as part of the interface defined by the selection screen. It can be supplied with a value by the calling program when it is called with [SUBMIT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapsubmit.htm).

If the addition NO-DISPLAY is specified, the low and high columns in the selection table can have any [flat](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenflat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") data types. These selection tables can only be supplied with data using the addition [WITH](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapsubmit_selscreen_parameters.htm) of the statement SUBMIT.

Note

The length of the values passed to the columns low and high in the selection table, for which there is no input field, is not restricted to 45 characters, as is the case for selection criteria with input fields.

Addition 3

... VISIBLE LENGTH vlen

Effect

This addition defines the visible length of the input field as vlen, where vlen is entered directly as a positive number. If vlen is shorter than the length of columns low and high in the selection table and shorter than the maximum visible length, it is possible to scroll in the input field, which is displayed with the length of vlen. Otherwise, the addition is ignored.

Addition 4

... NO-EXTENSION

Effect

If this addition is specified, the pushbutton for multiple selection is not created on the [selection screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_screen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Note

The user cannot access the dialog box for multiple selection on the selection screen, which means that he or she cannot edit [selection tables](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") containing multiple rows.

Addition 5

... NO INTERVALS

Effect

If this addition is specified, the second input field is not created on the selection screen.

Note

The user can only specify a single comparison in the first row of the selection table on the selection screen. Intervals can still be selected in the dialog box for multiple selection.

Example

Declaration of a selection criterion for which a single comparison is possible on the selection screen, but multiple selection is not possible.

DATA spfli\_wa TYPE spfli.
SELECT-OPTIONS s\_carrid FOR spfli\_wa-carrid NO-EXTENSION
                                            NO INTERVALS.

[3\. ... MATCHCODE OBJECT search\_help](#!ABAP_ADDITION_3@3@)
[4\. ... MEMORY ID pid](#!ABAP_ADDITION_4@4@)

Effect

These additions allow a start value to be specified, allow lowercase, and integrate a search help or a [SPA/GPA parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenspa_gpa_parameter_1_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Addition 1

... DEFAULT val1 *\[*TO val2*\]* *\[*OPTION opt*\]* *\[*SIGN sgn*\]*

Effect

This addition defines [start values](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenstart_value_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") for the columns in the first row of the [selection table](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). Without the addition DEFAULT, type-dependent [initial values](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abeninitial_value_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") are used as start values.

val1 and val2 are used to define start values for columns low and high. These start values can either be specified as literals or as previously defined data objects. If the data type of the specified start values does not match the data type of the columns, these are converted according to the conversion rules.

The addition OPTION is used to define the start value for the option column. If the addition TO is not specified, one of the expressions eq, ne, ge, gt, le, lt, cp, or np must be specified directly for opt. If the addition TO is specified, either specify bt or nb must be specified. If the addition OPTION is not used, the content of the option column is set to ""EQ" or "BT". If specify cp or np are specified, the start value in val1 must contain at least one of the wildcard characters "\*" or "+" when data is passed to the selection table, otherwise the program terminates.

The addition SIGN is used to define the start value for the sign column. Either i or e must be specified directly for sgn. If the addition SIGN is not used, the content of column sign is changed to "I".

The times at which the start values are passed to the first position in the selection table are processed in the same way as with the addition DEFAULT to the [PARAMETERS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapparameters_value.htm) statement. If the selection table is not empty when the transfer takes place, the start values are not transferred to the first position. Only the [header line](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenheader_line_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in the selection table is filled with these values, which does not influence the [selection criterion](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_criterion_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Notes

-   The associated input fields on the [selection screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_screen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") are only filled with the start values if the first row in the selection table is not changed before the selection screen is sent. The system displays the value contained in the selection table when the event [AT SELECTION-SCREEN OUTPUT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapat_selection-screen.htm) has been processed. Start values for multiple selection can only be defined by inserting lines in the selection table.
    
-   If start values are specified, these must have the internal format of the ABAP values, and not the output format of the screen display.
    

Addition 2

... LOWER CASE

Effect

This addition prevents the content of character-like fields from being converted to block capitals when the data is transported from the input fields on the selection screen to the selection table.

Addition 3

... MATCHCODE OBJECT search\_help

Effect

This addition associates the input fields for the selection criterion with a search help search\_help from ABAP Dictionary. The name of the search help must be specified directly. The addition has the same effect on the input fields as when it is used with a [PARAMETERS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapparameters_value.htm) statement for an input field for a parameter.

Addition 4

... MEMORY ID pid

Effect

This addition associates the first input field with an [SPA/GPA parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenspa_gpa_parameter_1_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in the [user memory](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenuser_memory_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The ID pid of the SPA/GPA parameter must be specified directly and it can contain a maximum of 20 characters. The addition has the same effect on the first input field as when it is used with a [PARAMETERS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapparameters_value.htm) statement for an input field for a parameter.

If the specified ID pid is not in the database table TPARA, the extended program check reports an error.

Selection Screens, Default Values for Selection Criteria

The example shows which default values you can set for selection criteria.

Source Code

REPORT demo\_sel\_screen\_select\_default.
DATA wa\_spfli TYPE spfli.
SELECT-OPTIONS airline FOR wa\_spfli-carrid
               DEFAULT 'AA'
                    TO 'LH'
                OPTION  nb
                  SIGN  i.

Description

The symbol before the first field indicates that the field airline-option contains the operator NB. The green colour indicates that the field airline-sign contains the value "I". The arrow on the right pushbutton is not green since only one line of the selection table is filled.

Effect

This declares a selection criterion selcrit for a data object dobj or a type specified in name. Selection criteria are components of a [selection screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_screen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), to which are assigned a [selection table](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in the ABAP program, as well as two input fields and a pushbutton for multiple selection.

The name of the selection criterion selcrit is limited to a maximum of 8 characters. This statement is allowed in the global declaration part of [executable programs](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenexecutable_program_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), [function groups](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenfunction_group_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), and [module pools](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenmodul_pool_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). In function groups and module pools, the statement is only allowed within the definition of a [standalone selection screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselection-screen_definition.htm). In executable programs, the statement is otherwise automatically assigned to the [standard selection screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselection-screen_standard.htm).

The statement SELECT-OPTIONS has the following effect:

-   The statement declares a selection table in the program with the name selcrit. A selection table is an internal [standard table](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenstandard_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") with [header line](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenheader_line_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and [standard key](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenstandard_key_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). In selection tables, multiple selection conditions can be saved. The content of selection tables can be analyzed in a [relational expression](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenrelational_expression_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") with the [relational operator](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenrelational_operator_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [IN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenlogexp_select_option.htm) or in a [similar expression](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenwhere_logexp_seltab.htm) of a WHERE condition in Open SQL. Selection tables have the following four columns:
    

-   sign of type c and length 1. The content of sign determines for every row whether the result of the condition formulated in the column is included or excluded in the entire resulting set for all rows. Valid values are "I" for include and "E" for exclude.

-   option of type c with length 2. option contains the selection option for the condition of the row in the form of relational operators. Valid operators are "EQ", "NE", "GE", "GT", "LE", "LT", "CP", and "NP", if the column high is initial, and "BT", "NB", if column high is not initial. For the options "CP" and "NP", the data type of the columns low and high must be c, and special rules apply to entries on the selection screen.

-   low of the data type defined after [FOR](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_for.htm). This column is designated for the comparison value or the lower interval limitation.

-   high of the data type defined after [FOR](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_for.htm). This column is designated for the upper interval limitation.

-   Two input fields with the name selcrit-low and selcrit-high are created on the current selection screen using a matching external data type in a new row at positions 35 and 60. The length of the input fields is based upon the length of the data type which is defined after FOR. The maximum length of the input fields is 255. The maximum visible length of the input fields is between 10 and 18 (depending on the nesting depth in framed blocks). If the length is greater than the maximum visible length, the content is displayed as movable.
    An output field generated automatically is displayed in the first position available to the left of the input field as a label with a length of between 20 and 30 depending on the nesting depth in blocks with frames. The output field contains either the name of the selcrit selection criterion or the selection text to which the selection criterion is assigned in the text elements of the program. If the user requests field or input help on the output field using the function key F1 or F4, the same output is displayed as if one of the input fields is chosen.
    A multiple selection pushbutton is created after the second input field. If this pushbutton is selected, a dialog screen with four [tabstrip control pages](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentab_page_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") appears, in which the input fields are again displayed in tabular form in [Table Controls](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentable_control_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The tabstrip pages are separated based on individual value comparison, interval limitation, and settings for the column sign.
    Users can select an input field with a double-click on the selection screen or use the dialog screen for multiple selection. On the selection screen, the value of the column sign can also be chosen. On the dialog screen for multiple selection, this is done by selecting the respective tabstrip page. If the selection option is not equal to "EQ" or "BT", it is displayed as an icon in front of the first input field. The color of the icon is green if the content of the column sign is "I", and red if it is "E".
    The selection options "CP" and "NP" can be selected only if the first input field contains one of the wildcard characters "\*" or "+". "+" masks a single character, "\*" masks any character string, even an empty one. If one of these characters is entered, the selection option is automatically set to "CP". If "CP" is set, and all wildcard characters have been removed, the selection option is automatically set to "EQ" when there is a user action. This limitation does not apply within the program. When the selection table is evaluated, the column low can also contain a string without wildcard characters for the selection options "CP" and "NP".
    The attributes of the elements on the selection screen can be influenced with the statement [screen\_options](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_screen.htm) or the statement [SELECTION-SCREEN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselection-screen.htm).
    
-   The first row of the selection table selcrit is associated with the input fields on the selection screen. All rows are displayed in the dialog box for multiple selection.
    Each time before the selection screen is sent to the [selection screen event](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_screen_event_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") ATSELECTION-SCREEN OUTPUT, the content of first row in the selection table is transported to the selection screen, with a [conversion routine](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenconversion_routine_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") being executed if required. If the length of the columns low and high in the first row of the selection table is greater than 255, the surplus content is cut off on the right. It is only possible for all rows to be transported if the button for multiple selections is selected. A conversion routine might be executed here, and rows might be cut off. Settings for the content of the input fields can be made in [value\_options](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_value.htm).
    After a user action on the selection screen, the contents of the input fields and the chosen settings are transported to the first row and the header row of the selection table.
    After a user action on the dialog box for multiple selections, the contents of all input fields and the chosen settings are transported to the rows of the selection table. During these transports, the contents of character-type fields are converted by default into capitals, after which a conversion routine is performed, if required. After each transport, various [selection screen events](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapat_selection-screen_events.htm) are raised.
    If a value has been entered in the entry field for the upper interval high, the system checks whether this value is greater than the lower interval limit low following each transport and conversion routine (if performed). If necessary, an [error message](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenerror_message_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is sent. This check can be switched off before the selection screen is sent, using the function module RS\_SELOPT\_NO\_INTERVAL\_CHECK.
    
-   If selection criteria are defined in the selection include of a logical database, further additions [ldb\_options](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_ldb.htm) are necessary or possible.
    
-   If, in an executable program, a selection criterion is defined for a component of a node of the associated logical database, declared by [TABLES](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abaptables.htm) or [NODES](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapnodes.htm), and the node in question is intended for dynamic selection on the logical database, the selection table is passed (by default) to the logical database, after [selection screen processing](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselscreen_processing_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), where it is handled as a dynamic selection. Furthermore, in this case, the input fields for the corresponding dynamic selection are displayed directly on the selection screen. Therefore the user does not need to select the fields using the Dynamic Selections function. This transfer can be suppressed using the addition [NO DATABASE SELECTION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_no_db_sel.htm).
    

Notes

-   To avoid undefined system behavior, the header row of a selection table should not be changed in the program. Read access should also be avoided. Instead separate work areas, field symbols, or data references should be used, as always for internal tables.
    
-   If a selection criterion is supplied with data when calling up an executable program using [SUBMIT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapsubmit.htm), a [conversion routine](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenconversion_routine_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") may be performed for the first row only, while the value of the columns low and high will be truncated at position 255 for the first row only. If the selection criterion is declared with the addition [NO-DISPLAY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_screen.htm), no conversion routine or truncation will be performed for the first row either.
    
-   If the type of the selection criterion is a [decimal floating point number](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendecfloat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that does not refer to a data type in ABAP Dictionary, the output style preserve scaling is set for the input field of the selection screen. Here, any trailing zeroes are preserved in the decimal places. If there is a reference to a data type in the ABAP Dictionary, the output style defined there is used.
    
-   If the type of the selection criteria is a [packed number](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenpacked_number_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or a [decimal floating point number](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendecfloat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") defined in ABAP Dictionary, the attribute sign must be set for the type attribute, so that negative numbers can be displayed on the selection screen. This setting is only possible for [domains](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendomain_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and not for specifying a built-in type directly for [data elements](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendata_element_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or structure components. If a negative number is entered on the selection screen and this property is not set, the system rejects it with an error message. If the columns low or high contain a negative number when the selection screen is called, an non-handleable exception is raised.
    
-   If the type of the selection criterion is a [decimal floating point number](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendecfloat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") defined in ABAP Dictionary for which the output style "currency amount" is specified, only numbers with the corresponding amount of decimal places can be entered on the selection screen. If a corresponding ABAP data object contains a number with too many decimal places when the selection screen is called, a non-handleable exception is raised. If the output style is "extended currency amount", additional decimal places can be displayed.
    
-   The columns sign and option of a selection table declared using SELECT-OPTIONS are not related to data types in ABAP Dictionary. In the case of [ranges tables](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenranges_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") defined in ABAP Dictionary, these columns refer to the data elements DDSIGN and DDOPTION.

Syntax

... FOR *{*dobj*|*(name)*}* ...

Alternatives:

[1\. ... FOR dobj](#!ABAP_ALTERNATIVE_1@1@)
[2\. ... FOR (name)](#!ABAP_ALTERNATIVE_2@2@)

Effect

This addition determines the data type of the columns low and high in the [selection table](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The data type can be defined by means of a static reference to an existing data object dobj or by a dynamic reference to a data type from ABAP Dictionary in name.

If the addition [NO-DISPLAY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_screen.htm) is not specified, the data type of the columns low and high in the selection table must be elementary and [flat](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenflat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and the numeric type f is not allowed. If the addition NO-DISPLAY is specified, any data types, except [enumerated types](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenenumerated_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), are possible.

Note

When referencing data types from ABAP Dictionary, the [selection criterion](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_criterion_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") inherits all the screen-relevant attributes defined there. During data transport to and from the input fields, any conversion routines defined in the domain are executed. The text defined in ABAP Dictionary can be inherited as a selection text. Note, however, that the input fields on the selection screen are associated with a global data object belonging to the program and do not have any real reference to the dictionary, in contrast to dynpro fields, which are created in Screen Painter with reference to the dictionary. This has a particular effect on automatic support for input help (F4) and value checking. In comparison with general dynpros, input help functions are limited here in that dependencies between fields and previously entered data are ignored. No automatic value checking is performed.

Alternative 1

... FOR dobj

Effect

If this addition is specified, the columns low and high in the selection table inherit all the attributes of a data object dobj that has already been declared, most importantly a reference to ABAP Dictionary, if applicable. dobj expects a data object that is elementary and flat and not of the type f (unless [NO-DISPLAY is used](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_screen.htm)) and is not an [enumerated type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenenumerated_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Note

As well as the data objects referred to using FOR from their own program, the public attributes of global classes are also relevant data objects.

Example

Typical declaration and application of a selection criterion.

DATA spfli\_wa TYPE spfli.
SELECT-OPTIONS s\_carrid FOR spfli\_wa-carrid.
SELECT \*
       FROM spfli
       WHERE carrid IN @s\_carrid
       INTO @spfli\_wa.
  ...
ENDSELECT.

Alternative 2

... FOR (name)

Effect

This addition is used to create the columns low and high in the selection table with data type c and length 45. The input fields are displayed on the selection screen, but with a length, field help, and input help appropriate for the data type specified in name.

name expects a [flat](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenflat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") character-like data object that contains the name of a component in a flat structure from ABAP Dictionary in uppercase letters when the selection screen is accessed. The following can be specified for name:

-   Constant

If the data object name is specified as a constant, it can be evaluated statically and the specified component is identified as the used object.

-   Variable

If the data object name is specified as a variable, it is specified only dynamically and the content is not evaluated statically.

A text field literal can be specified for name, but its content is ignored. If the [text pool](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentext_pool_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") currently loaded does not contain a selection text for the parameter, the output field displays the corresponding field label from ABAP Dictionary. When data is transported from the input field to the selection table, the content is converted as if it were assigned by the corresponding ABAP data type (no formatting characters, period as a decimal separator, date format "yyyymmdd", and so on).

If the content of name is not a structure component in ABAP Dictionary, the input fields are displayed according to the actual type of the columns low and high. This also applies if a literal is specified for name. If a selection text for the parameter is not created in the text pool currently loaded, the output field contains the text "Generic Selection Option".

A dynamic reference to a data type is not possible in a selection include for a [logical database](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenlogical_data_base_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Example

Description

On the selection screen 100, the name of the table dbtab and its column column can be specified. These are then used for the dynamic layout of the selection criterion on the selection screen 500.

Two input fields and a pushbutton to enter additional values for the selection criterion are displayed. The value which the user enters in the first input field is written to the component selcrit-low of the selection table; the value for the second field is written to the component selcrit-high.

For more complex selections, the user can use the pushbutton on the right side of the selection screen to display the GUI window for multiple selections.

The contents of the selection table are then shown in a list. The first column determines whether the subsequent values are to be included or not; the second contains the Boolean operator and the last two columns contain the limits low and high.

SELECT-OPTIONS - FOR

[Quick Reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_shortref.htm)

Syntax

... FOR *{*dobj*|*(name)*}* ...

Alternatives:

[1\. ... FOR dobj](#!ABAP_ALTERNATIVE_1@1@)
[2\. ... FOR (name)](#!ABAP_ALTERNATIVE_2@2@)

Effect

This addition determines the data type of the columns low and high in the [selection table](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The data type can be defined by means of a static reference to an existing data object dobj or by a dynamic reference to a data type from ABAP Dictionary in name.

If the addition [NO-DISPLAY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_screen.htm) is not specified, the data type of the columns low and high in the selection table must be elementary and [flat](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenflat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and the numeric type f is not allowed. If the addition NO-DISPLAY is specified, any data types, except [enumerated types](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenenumerated_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), are possible.

Note

When referencing data types from ABAP Dictionary, the [selection criterion](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_criterion_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") inherits all the screen-relevant attributes defined there. During data transport to and from the input fields, any conversion routines defined in the domain are executed. The text defined in ABAP Dictionary can be inherited as a selection text. Note, however, that the input fields on the selection screen are associated with a global data object belonging to the program and do not have any real reference to the dictionary, in contrast to dynpro fields, which are created in Screen Painter with reference to the dictionary. This has a particular effect on automatic support for input help (F4) and value checking. In comparison with general dynpros, input help functions are limited here in that dependencies between fields and previously entered data are ignored. No automatic value checking is performed.

Alternative 1

... FOR dobj

Effect

If this addition is specified, the columns low and high in the selection table inherit all the attributes of a data object dobj that has already been declared, most importantly a reference to ABAP Dictionary, if applicable. dobj expects a data object that is elementary and flat and not of the type f (unless [NO-DISPLAY is used](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect-options_screen.htm)) and is not an [enumerated type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenenumerated_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Note

As well as the data objects referred to using FOR from their own program, the public attributes of global classes are also relevant data objects.

Example

Typical declaration and application of a selection criterion.

DATA spfli\_wa TYPE spfli.
SELECT-OPTIONS s\_carrid FOR spfli\_wa-carrid.
SELECT \*
       FROM spfli
       WHERE carrid IN @s\_carrid
       INTO @spfli\_wa.
  ...
ENDSELECT.

Alternative 2

... FOR (name)

Effect

This addition is used to create the columns low and high in the selection table with data type c and length 45. The input fields are displayed on the selection screen, but with a length, field help, and input help appropriate for the data type specified in name.

name expects a [flat](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenflat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") character-like data object that contains the name of a component in a flat structure from ABAP Dictionary in uppercase letters when the selection screen is accessed. The following can be specified for name:

-   Constant

If the data object name is specified as a constant, it can be evaluated statically and the specified component is identified as the used object.

-   Variable

If the data object name is specified as a variable, it is specified only dynamically and the content is not evaluated statically.

A text field literal can be specified for name, but its content is ignored. If the [text pool](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentext_pool_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") currently loaded does not contain a selection text for the parameter, the output field displays the corresponding field label from ABAP Dictionary. When data is transported from the input field to the selection table, the content is converted as if it were assigned by the corresponding ABAP data type (no formatting characters, period as a decimal separator, date format "yyyymmdd", and so on).

If the content of name is not a structure component in ABAP Dictionary, the input fields are displayed according to the actual type of the columns low and high. This also applies if a literal is specified for name. If a selection text for the parameter is not created in the text pool currently loaded, the output field contains the text "Generic Selection Option".

A dynamic reference to a data type is not possible in a selection include for a [logical database](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenlogical_data_base_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Example

Dynamic design of the selection criterion selcrit on selection screen 500 based on the entries in the [standard selection screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenstandard_selscreen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") for an executable program.

PARAMETERS: dbtab  TYPE c LENGTH 30,
            column TYPE c LENGTH 30.
DATA name(80) TYPE c.
SELECTION-SCREEN BEGIN OF SCREEN 500 AS WINDOW.
SELECT-OPTIONS selcrit FOR (name).
SELECTION-SCREEN END OF SCREEN 500.
name = dbtab && '-' && column.
CALL SELECTION-SCREEN 500 STARTING AT 10 10.

[4\. ... NO-EXTENSION](#!ABAP_ADDITION_4@4@)
[5\. ... NO INTERVALS](#!ABAP_ADDITION_5@5@)

Effect

These additions can be used to declare the first input field as a mandatory field, hide the input field on the [selection screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_screen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), and define the visible length of the field. The display of the second input field and the pushbutton for multiple selection can be suppressed. The addition [MODIF ID](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselection-screen_modif_id.htm) assigns all screen elements of the [selection criterion](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_criterion_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") to the [modification group](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenmodification_group_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") modid.

Note

As well as the additions already available, the function module SELECT\_OPTIONS\_RESTRICT can also be used to restrict the number of selection options offered and prohibit the value "E" for the column sign in the [selection table](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") before the selection screen is sent.

Addition 1

... OBLIGATORY

Effect

This addition defines the first input field for the selection criterion on the selection screen as a mandatory field. If this field is blank, the user cannot exit the selection screen using the Execute function (F8) and can only use the Back, Exit, or Cancel functions.

Addition 2

... NO-DISPLAY

Effect

If this addition is specified, no screen elements are created on the selection screen for the selection criterion. In an [executable program](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenexecutable_program_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), a selection criterion of this type is used exclusively as part of the interface defined by the selection screen. It can be supplied with a value by the calling program when it is called with [SUBMIT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapsubmit.htm).

If the addition NO-DISPLAY is specified, the low and high columns in the selection table can have any [flat](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenflat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") data types. These selection tables can only be supplied with data using the addition [WITH](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapsubmit_selscreen_parameters.htm) of the statement SUBMIT.

Note

The length of the values passed to the columns low and high in the selection table, for which there is no input field, is not restricted to 45 characters, as is the case for selection criteria with input fields.

Addition 3

... VISIBLE LENGTH vlen

Effect

This addition defines the visible length of the input field as vlen, where vlen is entered directly as a positive number. If vlen is shorter than the length of columns low and high in the selection table and shorter than the maximum visible length, it is possible to scroll in the input field, which is displayed with the length of vlen. Otherwise, the addition is ignored.

Addition 4

... NO-EXTENSION

Effect

If this addition is specified, the pushbutton for multiple selection is not created on the [selection screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_screen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Note

The user cannot access the dialog box for multiple selection on the selection screen, which means that he or she cannot edit [selection tables](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") containing multiple rows.

Addition 5

... NO INTERVALS

Effect

If this addition is specified, the second input field is not created on the selection screen.

Note

The user can only specify a single comparison in the first row of the selection table on the selection screen. Intervals can still be selected in the dialog box for multiple selection.

Example

Declaration of a selection criterion for which a single comparison is possible on the selection screen, but multiple selection is not possible.

DATA spfli\_wa TYPE spfli.
SELECT-OPTIONS s\_carrid FOR spfli\_wa-carrid NO-EXTENSION
                                            NO INTERVALS.

[3\. ... MATCHCODE OBJECT search\_help](#!ABAP_ADDITION_3@3@)
[4\. ... MEMORY ID pid](#!ABAP_ADDITION_4@4@)

Effect

These additions allow a start value to be specified, allow lowercase, and integrate a search help or a [SPA/GPA parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenspa_gpa_parameter_1_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Addition 1

... DEFAULT val1 *\[*TO val2*\]* *\[*OPTION opt*\]* *\[*SIGN sgn*\]*

Effect

This addition defines [start values](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenstart_value_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") for the columns in the first row of the [selection table](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). Without the addition DEFAULT, type-dependent [initial values](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abeninitial_value_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") are used as start values.

val1 and val2 are used to define start values for columns low and high. These start values can either be specified as literals or as previously defined data objects. If the data type of the specified start values does not match the data type of the columns, these are converted according to the conversion rules.

The addition OPTION is used to define the start value for the option column. If the addition TO is not specified, one of the expressions eq, ne, ge, gt, le, lt, cp, or np must be specified directly for opt. If the addition TO is specified, either specify bt or nb must be specified. If the addition OPTION is not used, the content of the option column is set to ""EQ" or "BT". If specify cp or np are specified, the start value in val1 must contain at least one of the wildcard characters "\*" or "+" when data is passed to the selection table, otherwise the program terminates.

The addition SIGN is used to define the start value for the sign column. Either i or e must be specified directly for sgn. If the addition SIGN is not used, the content of column sign is changed to "I".

The times at which the start values are passed to the first position in the selection table are processed in the same way as with the addition DEFAULT to the [PARAMETERS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapparameters_value.htm) statement. If the selection table is not empty when the transfer takes place, the start values are not transferred to the first position. Only the [header line](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenheader_line_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in the selection table is filled with these values, which does not influence the [selection criterion](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_criterion_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Notes

-   The associated input fields on the [selection screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_screen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") are only filled with the start values if the first row in the selection table is not changed before the selection screen is sent. The system displays the value contained in the selection table when the event [AT SELECTION-SCREEN OUTPUT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapat_selection-screen.htm) has been processed. Start values for multiple selection can only be defined by inserting lines in the selection table.
    
-   If start values are specified, these must have the internal format of the ABAP values, and not the output format of the screen display.
    

Addition 2

... LOWER CASE

Effect

This addition prevents the content of character-like fields from being converted to block capitals when the data is transported from the input fields on the selection screen to the selection table.

Addition 3

... MATCHCODE OBJECT search\_help

Effect

This addition associates the input fields for the selection criterion with a search help search\_help from ABAP Dictionary. The name of the search help must be specified directly. The addition has the same effect on the input fields as when it is used with a [PARAMETERS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapparameters_value.htm) statement for an input field for a parameter.

Addition 4

... MEMORY ID pid

Effect

This addition associates the first input field with an [SPA/GPA parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenspa_gpa_parameter_1_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in the [user memory](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenuser_memory_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The ID pid of the SPA/GPA parameter must be specified directly and it can contain a maximum of 20 characters. The addition has the same effect on the first input field as when it is used with a [PARAMETERS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapparameters_value.htm) statement for an input field for a parameter.

If the specified ID pid is not in the database table TPARA, the extended program check reports an error.

Selection Screens, Default Values for Selection Criteria

The example shows which default values you can set for selection criteria.

Source Code

REPORT demo\_sel\_screen\_select\_default.
DATA wa\_spfli TYPE spfli.
SELECT-OPTIONS airline FOR wa\_spfli-carrid
               DEFAULT 'AA'
                    TO 'LH'
                OPTION  nb
                  SIGN  i.

Description

The symbol before the first field indicates that the field airline-option contains the operator NB. The green colour indicates that the field airline-sign contains the value "I". The arrow on the right pushbutton is not green since only one line of the selection table is filled.

These additions allow a start value to be specified, allow lowercase, and integrate a search help or a [SPA/GPA parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenspa_gpa_parameter_1_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Addition 1

... DEFAULT val1 *\[*TO val2*\]* *\[*OPTION opt*\]* *\[*SIGN sgn*\]*

Effect

This addition defines [start values](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenstart_value_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") for the columns in the first row of the [selection table](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). Without the addition DEFAULT, type-dependent [initial values](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abeninitial_value_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") are used as start values.

val1 and val2 are used to define start values for columns low and high. These start values can either be specified as literals or as previously defined data objects. If the data type of the specified start values does not match the data type of the columns, these are converted according to the conversion rules.

The addition OPTION is used to define the start value for the option column. If the addition TO is not specified, one of the expressions eq, ne, ge, gt, le, lt, cp, or np must be specified directly for opt. If the addition TO is specified, either specify bt or nb must be specified. If the addition OPTION is not used, the content of the option column is set to ""EQ" or "BT". If specify cp or np are specified, the start value in val1 must contain at least one of the wildcard characters "\*" or "+" when data is passed to the selection table, otherwise the program terminates.

The addition SIGN is used to define the start value for the sign column. Either i or e must be specified directly for sgn. If the addition SIGN is not used, the content of column sign is changed to "I".

The times at which the start values are passed to the first position in the selection table are processed in the same way as with the addition DEFAULT to the [PARAMETERS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapparameters_value.htm) statement. If the selection table is not empty when the transfer takes place, the start values are not transferred to the first position. Only the [header line](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenheader_line_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in the selection table is filled with these values, which does not influence the [selection criterion](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_criterion_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Notes

-   The associated input fields on the [selection screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_screen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") are only filled with the start values if the first row in the selection table is not changed before the selection screen is sent. The system displays the value contained in the selection table when the event [AT SELECTION-SCREEN OUTPUT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapat_selection-screen.htm) has been processed. Start values for multiple selection can only be defined by inserting lines in the selection table.
    
-   If start values are specified, these must have the internal format of the ABAP values, and not the output format of the screen display.
    

Addition 2

... LOWER CASE

Effect

This addition prevents the content of character-like fields from being converted to block capitals when the data is transported from the input fields on the selection screen to the selection table.

Addition 3

... MATCHCODE OBJECT search\_help

Effect

This addition associates the input fields for the selection criterion with a search help search\_help from ABAP Dictionary. The name of the search help must be specified directly. The addition has the same effect on the input fields as when it is used with a [PARAMETERS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapparameters_value.htm) statement for an input field for a parameter.

Addition 4

... MEMORY ID pid

Effect

This addition associates the first input field with an [SPA/GPA parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenspa_gpa_parameter_1_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in the [user memory](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenuser_memory_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The ID pid of the SPA/GPA parameter must be specified directly and it can contain a maximum of 20 characters. The addition has the same effect on the first input field as when it is used with a [PARAMETERS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapparameters_value.htm) statement for an input field for a parameter.

If the specified ID pid is not in the database table TPARA, the extended program check reports an error.

[ABAP - Keyword Documentation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenabap.htm) →  [ABAP - Reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenabap_reference.htm) →  [SAP GUI User Dialogs](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenabap_screens.htm) →  [Selection Screens](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_screen.htm) → 

Calling Selection Screens

[Selection screens](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_screen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") can be called as follows:

-   by the statement [SUBMIT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapsubmit.htm)

-   as a selection screen of a [report transaction](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenreport_transaction_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")

-   as the initial dynpro of a [dialog transaction](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendialog_transaction_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")

-   by the statement [CALL SELECTION-SCREEN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapcall_selection_screen.htm)

Each call starts [selection screen processing](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselscreen_processing_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The display language of the selection screen is determined by the current [text environment language](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentext_env_langu_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), which can be set with the statement [SET LOCALE LANGUAGE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapset_locale.htm).

Called by SUBMIT

When an [executable program](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenexecutable_program_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is called using the statement SUBMIT, the standard selection screen or the selection screen specified in the statement is called between the events [INITIALIZATION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapinitialization.htm) and [START-OF-SELECTION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapstart-of-selection.htm), if it contains at least one input field or pushbutton.

Called by report transaction

When a report transaction is executed, the associated executable program is also started internally using SUBMIT and the selection screen defined for the transaction is called between the events INITIALIZATION and START-OF-SELECTION.

Called by dialog transaction

If a selection screen of the associated program is defined as the initial dynpro in a dialog transaction, the transaction code is used to call the selection screen when this program is executed. This screen is not handled like the first dynpro in a [dynpro sequence](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendynpro_sequence_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") however (see [Selection Screen Processing](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_screen_events.htm)).

Notes

-   Selection screens should not be used as the initial dynpro of a dialog transaction, since this does not generally produce the expected program behavior.

-   The display language of a general dynpro is the [logon language](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenlogon_language_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and not the [text environment language](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentext_env_langu_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

CALL SELECTION-SCREEN

[Quick Reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapcall_selection-screen_shortref.htm)

Syntax

CALL SELECTION-SCREEN dynnr
                      *\[*STARTING AT col1 lin1
                      *\[*ENDING   AT col2 lin2*\]**\]*
                      *\[*USING SELECTION-SET variant*\]*.

Extras:

[1\. ... STARTING AT col1 lin1 *\[*ENDING AT col2 lin2*\]*](#!ABAP_ADDITION_1@1@)
[2\. ... USING SELECTION-SET variant](#!ABAP_ADDITION_2@2@)

Effect

This statement calls the [selection screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_screen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") with the [dynpro number](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendynpro_number_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") specified in dynnr and starts [selection screen processing](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselscreen_processing_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). dynnr expects a data object of the type n and the length 4.

The statement CALL SELECTION-SCREEN accesses the selection screens of the respective [main program](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenmain_program_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current program group. These screens work with the parameters and selection criteria of the main program and trigger the selection screen processing in the main program. The main program is generally the current program, except for the case when calling a selection screen in an externally called subroutine. A non-handleable exception is raised if the specified selection screen is not contained in the main program of the program group.

Any selection screen of the main program can be called, in particular the standard selection screen. The default setting is the display of the selection screen in the GUI window of the preceding dynpro.

System Fields

sy-subrc

Meaning

0

The user selected the function Execute or Execute + Print on the selection screen.

4

User chose Back, Exit, or Cancel on the selection screen.

Notes

-   The statement [CALL SCREEN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapcall_screen.htm) cannot be used to call selection screens, since otherwise the proper execution of the selection screen processing cannot be guaranteed.
    
-   If the called selection screen is displayed in a dialog window, it is advisable to use the addition AS WINDOW when specifying the selection screen.
    

Addition 1

... STARTING AT col1 lin1 *\[*ENDING AT col2 lin2*\]*

Effect

The addition STARTING AT creates a modal dialog box and the selection screen is displayed in it. The upper left corner of the dialog box is determined by the values in col1 and lin1 for column and row. These values refer to the GUI window with the [popup level](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenpop-up_level_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") 0. The lower right corner is either set automatically or can be specified in col2 and lin2 after ENDING AT. col1, lin1, col2, and lin2 expect data objects of the type i. The values of col1, lin1 should be less than col2, lin2, otherwise the behavior will be undefined.

Addition 2

... USING SELECTION-SET variant

Effect

The addition USING SELECTION-SET populates the parameters and selection criteria of the selection screen with the values of a [selection screen variant](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenvariant_2_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") specified in variant. The values are passed to the associated data objects of the program immediately before the event [ATSELECTION-SCREEN OUTPUT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapat_selection-screen.htm). variant expects a [character-like data object](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencharlike_data_object_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") which, when the statement is executed, contains the name of a [selection screen variant](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenvariant_2_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the main program stored for the selection screen in uppercase. If a nonexistent variant or a variant of another selection screen of the main program, is specified, the addition is ignored.

Selection Screen Processing

Selection screen processing packages the [dynpro flow logic](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendynpro_flow_logic_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") together with the sending of the [selection screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_screen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). No dialog modules of the program are called. Instead, various [selection screen events](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_screen_event_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") are triggered for which event blocks can be programmed. [PBO](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenpbo_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") processing triggers the event

-   [AT SELECTION-SCREEN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapat_selection-screen.htm) [OUTPUT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapat_selection-screen_events.htm)

ausgelöst. [PAI](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenpai_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") processing triggers a variety of different events

-   [AT SELECTION-SCREEN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapat_selection-screen.htm) [...](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapat_selection-screen_events.htm)

Selection screen processing of a displayed selection screen is ended only by selection of the following functions of the [GUI status](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_screen_overview.htm):

-   Execute or Execute + Print
    Triggers the selection screen events of PAI processing. After this, the event [START-OF-SELECTION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapstart-of-selection.htm) is triggered for standard selection screens called using [SUBMIT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapsubmit.htm). For selection screens called using [dialog transactions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendialog_transaction_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), the program is ended. A call in the program resumes the program after the statement [CALL SELECTION-SCREEN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapcall_selection_screen.htm).

-   Back, Exit, or Cancel
    Triggers the event AT SELECTION-SCREEN ON EXIT-COMMAND only. After this, the program is ended for standard selection screens called using SUBMIT and dialog transactions. Otherwise, sy-subrc is set to 4 and the program resumes after the statement CALL SELECTION-SCREEN.

For all other user actions, the selection screen is called again automatically after selection screen processing is ended.

Notes

-   The selection screen processor also encapsulates the processing of the [function codes](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenfunction_code_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") assigned to the control elements of the selection screen. The function code that triggers PAI processing is passed to the component ucomm of an [interface work area](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abeninterface_work_area_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") sscrfields with the type of the structure SSCRFIELDS. If an interface work area of this type is declared in a program using the statement [TABLES](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abaptables.htm), the function code can be accessed. It is not advisable to access the system field sy-ucomm, however, since it is not possible to guarantee that it has the same value as sscrfields-ucomm in all situations.

-   Whether a program resumes depends on the function code in the UCOMM component of the [interface work area](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abeninterface_work_area_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") SSCRFIELDS at the end of PAI processing. If this is declared using TABLES and if this component is set to the value "ONLI" (for example, during processing of the standard selection screen of a program called using SUBMIT) and this value is assigned to the function Execute, the event START-OF-SELECTION is raised after selection screen processing. Overwrites of the system field sy-ucomm, however, are ignored.

-   To avoid ending the program following the processing of a selection screen called using a dialog transaction, either the [next dynpro](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abennext_dynpro_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") must be called using [LEAVE TO SCREEN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapleave_screen.htm) or a new [dynpro sequence](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendynpro_sequence_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") called using [CALL SCREEN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapcall_screen.htm) (during the processing of the selection screen). The statement [SET SCREEN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapset_screen.htm) is not enough here.

-   In selection screen processing, the statement [LOOP AT SCREEN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abaploop_at_screen.htm) can be used to access the attributes of screen elements on the selection screen.

AT SELECTION-SCREEN

[Quick Reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapat_selection-screen_shortref.htm)

Syntax

AT SELECTION-SCREEN [selscreen\_event](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapat_selection-screen_events.htm).

Effect

This statement defines event blocks for different events [selscreen\_event](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapat_selection-screen_events.htm) that are triggered by the [ABAP runtime environment](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenabap_runtime_envir_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") during [selection screen processing](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselscreen_processing_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Selection screen events occur immediately before sending a [selection screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_screen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and after certain user actions on a displayed selection screen. They assist in selection screen processing in the ABAP program.

AT SELECTION-SCREEN is triggered at least twice for actions on selection screens included as a [subscreen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensubscreen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") on another selection screen: First for the included selection screen and then the for selection screen or screens to be included.

Note

The event blocks after AT SELECTION-SCREEN are implemented internally as [procedures](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenprocedure_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). Declarative statements in these event blocks create local data.

Example

The program DEMO\_SELECTION\_SCREEN\_EVENTS demonstrates all selection results.

[8\. ... ON EXIT-COMMAND](#!ABAP_ALTERNATIVE_8@8@)

Effect

These additions allow individual evaluation of specific elements of the [selection screens](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_screen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the program. The information about which selection screen raised the event is in the system field sy-dynnr.

Alternative 1

... OUTPUT

Effect

This event is raised by the dynpro event [PBO](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenpbo_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of a selection screen. In the event block, the selection screen can be prepared using assignments to the data objects of parameters and selection criteria and using dynamic screen modifications.

Notes

-   The assignments to input fields in the event block AT SELECTION-SCREEN OUTPUT always affect the selection screen and overwrite the user input from previous displays of the same selection screen. Assignments in the event blocks [LOAD-OF-PROGRAM](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapload-of-program.htm) or [INITIALIZATION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapinitialization.htm), on the other hand, only have an effect the first time the program starts.
    
-   The statement [MODIFY SCREEN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapmodify_screen.htm) can be used during the event AT SELECTION-SCREEN OUTPUT to modify properties of screen elements of the selection screen.
    

Example

Modifies an input field of a selection screen declared using [PARAMETERS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapparameters.htm). The field input is made invisible using the characters "\*\*\*..." (for example, for entering a password).

PARAMETERS pass(30) TYPE c.
AT SELECTION-SCREEN OUTPUT.
  LOOP AT SCREEN INTO DATA(wa).
    IF wa-name = 'PASS'.
      wa-invisible = '1'.
      MODIFY screen FROM wa.
    ENDIF.
  ENDLOOP.

Alternative 2

... ON *{*para*|*selcrit*}*

Effect

This event is raised by the dynpro event [PAI](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenpai_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of a selection screen if the content of the input field of a parameter para or a line of a [selection criterion](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_criterion_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") selcrit was passed to the ABAP program. The user input can be checked in this event block. Sending a [warning](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenwarning_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or an [error message](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenerror_message_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in the event block makes the fields para and selcrit ready for input again.

No parameter that is defined as a radio button can be specified. For this purpose, the addition ON RADIOBUTTON GROUP is provided.

Note

If a user action takes place in the dialog box for the multiple selection of a selection criterion selcrit, the entries of the [selection table](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") are passed to the program, line by line. For each line, the event AT SELECTION-SCREEN ON selcrit is raised.

Alternative 3

... ON END OF selcrit

Effect

This event is raised after the selection table selcrit is passed in full to the program after a user action in the dialog box for the multiple selection has taken place. The entire selection table can be checked in this event block.

Alternative 4

... ON BLOCK block

Effect

This event is raised by the dynpro event PAI of a selection screen if all the input fields of a block block of the selection screen were passed to the ABAP program. The user input can be checked in the event block. Sending a warning or an error message in the event block makes all the fields of the block block ready for input again.

Alternative 5

... ON RADIOBUTTON GROUP group

Effect

This event is raised by the dynpro event [PAI](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenpai_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of a selection screen if all the fields of a radio button group group of the selection screen were passed to the ABAP program. The user input can be checked in this event block. Sending a [warning](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenwarning_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or [error message](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenerror_message_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in the event block makes all the radio buttons of the group group ready for input again.

Note

The individual fields of a radio button group are not passed individually and do not raise the event AT SELECTION-SCREEN ON par.

Alternative 6

... *{* *}*

Effect

The event AT SELECTION-SCREEN itself is raised as the last event in selection screen processing if all the input values were passed to the program. All user input can be checked in this event block. Sending a warning or an error message in the event block makes all the screen fields ready for input once again.

Alternative 7

... ON *{* HELP-REQUEST *|* VALUE-REQUEST *}* FOR *{*para*|*selcrit-low*|*selcrit-high*}*

Effect

The two events ON HELP-REQUEST and ON VALUE-REQUEST are raised by the dynpro events [POH](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenpoh_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and [POV](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenpov_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of a selection screen if, for the input field of a parameter para or one of the input fields of a [selection criterion](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_criterion_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") selcrit, the field help F1 or the input help F4 was called. Other [selection events](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_screen_event_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") are not raised.

In the event blocks, a self-defined field or input field can be programmed, which overrides any helps defined in ABAP Dictionary.

Notes

-   These event blocks can only be implemented for fields of the selection screen that are defined in the same ABAP program and not in any associated [logical database](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenlogical_data_base_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
    
-   The events for the field help and input help do not transport data between the selection screen and the ABAP program. As with general [dynpros](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendynpro_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), suitable function modules such as RS\_SELECTIONSCREEN\_READ and RS\_SELECTIONSCREEN\_UPDATE must be used for this. The parameters and selection criteria changed for the input help are transported to the selection screen.
    

Alternative 8

... ON EXIT-COMMAND

Effect

This event is raised if the user has called one of the functions Back, Exit, or Cancel. Any cleanup actions can be executed in this event block.

Example

This [executable program](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenexecutable_program_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") defines a standard selection screen and a further selection screen. In the event blocks AT SELECTION-SCREEN, the input in the selection screens can be specially handled using the evaluation of the name p\_carrid and the [dynpro number](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendynpro_number_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in sy-dynnr.

Selection screens, processing blocks and radio buttons

The example demonstrates how blocks and radio buttons are processed in selection screens.

Source Code

REPORT demo\_at\_selection\_on\_block .
SELECTION-SCREEN BEGIN OF BLOCK part1 WITH FRAME.
PARAMETERS: number1 TYPE i,
            number2 TYPE i,
            number3 TYPE i.
SELECTION-SCREEN END OF BLOCK part1.

    MESSAGE w888(sabapdemos) WITH text-002.
  ENDIF.

Description

In the event blocks AT SELECTION-SCREEN ON BLOCK and AT SELECTION-SCREEN ON RADIOBUTTON GROUP the user input is validated; if required, error messages are displayed.

If the user does not specify in block part1 any ascending numbers, then the entire block is made ready for input again.

If the user does not change the radio buttons of group rad, a warning appears.

Selection Screens, Field Help

The example shows a self-defined F1 help on selection screens.

Source Code

REPORT demo\_selection\_screen\_f1.
PARAMETERS: p\_carr\_1 TYPE s\_carr\_id,
            p\_carr\_2 TYPE spfli-carrid.
AT SELECTION-SCREEN ON HELP-REQUEST FOR p\_carr\_2.
  CALL SCREEN 100 STARTING AT 10 5
                  ENDING   AT 60 10.

Description

In this program, a selection screen with two parameters that are based on the data element S\_CARR\_ID of the ABAP Dictionary are declared. Whereas the Dictionary documentation is used as online help for p\_carr\_1, the system calls a separate screen with the number 100 for p\_carr\_2. Using the Screen Painter, this screen is defined as a modal dialog box with next screen 0, which displays the required help text as text fields. You are not required to program the flow logic for this screen.

AT LINE-SELECTION.
  CHECK NOT p\_carr\_2 IS INITIAL.
  LEAVE TO SCREEN 0.

Description

In this program, a selection screen with two parameters that are based on column CARRID of database table SPFLI is declared. Whereas for p\_carr\_1 the input help of the Dictionary is used, a special separate input help is programmed for p\_carr\_2. Screen 100 is called for this purpose. In the flow logic, the system starts the dialog module value\_list at the PBO event. The screen layout for screen 100 is not required, and the system does not call any dialog modules at the PAI event.

PROCESS BEFORE OUTPUT.
  MODULE value\_list.
PROCESS AFTER INPUT.

The dialog module value\_list suppresses the display of the screen layout of screen 100 and switches to list display. The list shows values for the parameter p\_carr\_2 and stores them in the HIDE area. Selecting a line on the value list triggers the event AT LINE-SELECTION, automatically putting the selected value from the HIDE area in the field p\_carr\_2. If the selection is valid, the system quits the event block for AT LINE-SELECTION directly with the selection screen and fills the input field accordingly.

[8\. ... ON EXIT-COMMAND](#!ABAP_ALTERNATIVE_8@8@)

Effect

These additions allow individual evaluation of specific elements of the [selection screens](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_screen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the program. The information about which selection screen raised the event is in the system field sy-dynnr.

Alternative 1

... OUTPUT

Effect

This event is raised by the dynpro event [PBO](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenpbo_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of a selection screen. In the event block, the selection screen can be prepared using assignments to the data objects of parameters and selection criteria and using dynamic screen modifications.

Notes

-   The assignments to input fields in the event block AT SELECTION-SCREEN OUTPUT always affect the selection screen and overwrite the user input from previous displays of the same selection screen. Assignments in the event blocks [LOAD-OF-PROGRAM](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapload-of-program.htm) or [INITIALIZATION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapinitialization.htm), on the other hand, only have an effect the first time the program starts.
    
-   The statement [MODIFY SCREEN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapmodify_screen.htm) can be used during the event AT SELECTION-SCREEN OUTPUT to modify properties of screen elements of the selection screen.
    

Example

Modifies an input field of a selection screen declared using [PARAMETERS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapparameters.htm). The field input is made invisible using the characters "\*\*\*..." (for example, for entering a password).

PARAMETERS pass(30) TYPE c.
AT SELECTION-SCREEN OUTPUT.
  LOOP AT SCREEN INTO DATA(wa).
    IF wa-name = 'PASS'.
      wa-invisible = '1'.
      MODIFY screen FROM wa.
    ENDIF.
  ENDLOOP.

Alternative 2

... ON *{*para*|*selcrit*}*

Effect

This event is raised by the dynpro event [PAI](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenpai_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of a selection screen if the content of the input field of a parameter para or a line of a [selection criterion](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_criterion_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") selcrit was passed to the ABAP program. The user input can be checked in this event block. Sending a [warning](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenwarning_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or an [error message](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenerror_message_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in the event block makes the fields para and selcrit ready for input again.

No parameter that is defined as a radio button can be specified. For this purpose, the addition ON RADIOBUTTON GROUP is provided.

Note

If a user action takes place in the dialog box for the multiple selection of a selection criterion selcrit, the entries of the [selection table](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") are passed to the program, line by line. For each line, the event AT SELECTION-SCREEN ON selcrit is raised.

Alternative 3

... ON END OF selcrit

Effect

This event is raised after the selection table selcrit is passed in full to the program after a user action in the dialog box for the multiple selection has taken place. The entire selection table can be checked in this event block.

Alternative 4

... ON BLOCK block

Effect

This event is raised by the dynpro event PAI of a selection screen if all the input fields of a block block of the selection screen were passed to the ABAP program. The user input can be checked in the event block. Sending a warning or an error message in the event block makes all the fields of the block block ready for input again.

Alternative 5

... ON RADIOBUTTON GROUP group

Effect

This event is raised by the dynpro event [PAI](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenpai_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of a selection screen if all the fields of a radio button group group of the selection screen were passed to the ABAP program. The user input can be checked in this event block. Sending a [warning](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenwarning_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or [error message](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenerror_message_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in the event block makes all the radio buttons of the group group ready for input again.

Note

The individual fields of a radio button group are not passed individually and do not raise the event AT SELECTION-SCREEN ON par.

Alternative 6

... *{* *}*

Effect

The event AT SELECTION-SCREEN itself is raised as the last event in selection screen processing if all the input values were passed to the program. All user input can be checked in this event block. Sending a warning or an error message in the event block makes all the screen fields ready for input once again.

Alternative 7

... ON *{* HELP-REQUEST *|* VALUE-REQUEST *}* FOR *{*para*|*selcrit-low*|*selcrit-high*}*

Effect

The two events ON HELP-REQUEST and ON VALUE-REQUEST are raised by the dynpro events [POH](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenpoh_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and [POV](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenpov_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of a selection screen if, for the input field of a parameter para or one of the input fields of a [selection criterion](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_criterion_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") selcrit, the field help F1 or the input help F4 was called. Other [selection events](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_screen_event_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") are not raised.

In the event blocks, a self-defined field or input field can be programmed, which overrides any helps defined in ABAP Dictionary.

Notes

-   These event blocks can only be implemented for fields of the selection screen that are defined in the same ABAP program and not in any associated [logical database](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenlogical_data_base_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
    
-   The events for the field help and input help do not transport data between the selection screen and the ABAP program. As with general [dynpros](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendynpro_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), suitable function modules such as RS\_SELECTIONSCREEN\_READ and RS\_SELECTIONSCREEN\_UPDATE must be used for this. The parameters and selection criteria changed for the input help are transported to the selection screen.
    

Alternative 8

... ON EXIT-COMMAND

Effect

This event is raised if the user has called one of the functions Back, Exit, or Cancel. Any cleanup actions can be executed in this event block.

Example

This [executable program](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenexecutable_program_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") defines a standard selection screen and a further selection screen. In the event blocks AT SELECTION-SCREEN, the input in the selection screens can be specially handled using the evaluation of the name p\_carrid and the [dynpro number](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendynpro_number_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in sy-dynnr.

AT SELECTION-SCREEN

[Quick Reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapat_selection-screen_shortref.htm)

Syntax

AT SELECTION-SCREEN [selscreen\_event](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapat_selection-screen_events.htm).

Effect

This statement defines event blocks for different events [selscreen\_event](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapat_selection-screen_events.htm) that are triggered by the [ABAP runtime environment](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenabap_runtime_envir_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") during [selection screen processing](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselscreen_processing_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Selection screen events occur immediately before sending a [selection screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenselection_screen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and after certain user actions on a displayed selection screen. They assist in selection screen processing in the ABAP program.

AT SELECTION-SCREEN is triggered at least twice for actions on selection screens included as a [subscreen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensubscreen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") on another selection screen: First for the included selection screen and then the for selection screen or screens to be included.

Note

The event blocks after AT SELECTION-SCREEN are implemented internally as [procedures](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenprocedure_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). Declarative statements in these event blocks create local data.

Example

The program DEMO\_SELECTION\_SCREEN\_EVENTS demonstrates all selection results.

Dynamic Selections

A dynamic selection is a selection condition that can be entered on a dynamically created selection screen. The associated selection screens are created, displayed, and processed by the system function modules FREE\_SELECTIONS\_.... of the function group SSEL. The selection screens can be displayed as standalone screens, or integrated into the screens of other dynpros or selection screens as a subscreen. Dynamic selections can be incorporated into logical database or used in any programs.

-   [Dynamic Selections in Logical Databases](#abenfree-selections-1--------dynamic-selections-in-all-programs---@ITOC@@ABENFREE_SELECTIONS_2)

Security Note

If used wrongly, dynamic programming techniques can present a serious security risk. Any dynamic content that is passed to a program from the outside must be checked thoroughly or escaped before being used in dynamic statements. This can be done using the system class CL\_ABAP\_DYN\_PRG or the predefined function [escape](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenescape_functions.htm). See [Security Risks of Input from Outside](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendynamic_programming_scrty.htm).

Dynamic Selections in Logical Databases

[Logical databases](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenlogical_data_base_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") can provide dynamic selections on their selections screens to specify further dynamic selection conditions for individual nodes of the logical database, in addition to the parameters and selection criteria already defined statically in the database. These dynamic conditions can then be evaluated in the database program of the logical database. Dynamic selections of a logical database can be declared simply using the addition [DYNAMIC SELECTIONS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselection-screen_ldb_dynamic.htm) of the statement [SELECTION-SCREEN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselection-screen.htm) in the database.

The ABAP runtime environment is responsible for calling function modules to create, display, and handle dynamic selections. The selections entered by the user are passed directly to data objects of the database program and can be evaluated there. For more information, see [Logical Databases - Dynamic Selections](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenldb_free_selections.htm).

Note

The special addition [WITH FREE SELECTIONS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapsubmit_selscreen_parameters.htm) of the statement [SUBMIT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapsubmit.htm) is used to pass parameters to selection screens of logical databases that provide dynamic selections. If this addition is used, the function modules mentioned above are generally also implemented.

Dynamic Selections in All Programs

In ABAP programs that work with classic dynpros, dynamic selections can be provided by the direct use of the following two function modules:

-   FREE\_SELECTIONS\_INIT

-   FREE\_SELECTIONS\_DIALOG

The function module FREE\_SELECTIONS\_INIT determines the entities for which dynamic selections are to be made. This could be, for example, database tables from ABAP Dictionary or any selection of valid fields. The result of the function module is a selection ID, which must be passed to the function module FREE\_SELECTIONS\_DIALOG.

The function module FREE\_SELECTIONS\_DIALOG can display differently configured selection screens in different formats. Users can enter dynamic selections on these selection screens for the fields provided there and, if required, can also choose fields for which they want to perform dynamic selections. If Save is chosen, the function module returns the specified selections to the caller in three different formats, which the caller can take from the following EXPORTING parameters:

-   WHERE\_CLAUSES
    This parameter passes an internal table with the conditions [sql\_cond](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenwhere_logexp.htm) generated according to the dynamic selections for [dynamic specification](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenwhere_logexp_dynamic.htm) in the [WHERE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapwhere.htm) clause of [SELECT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect.htm) statements.

-   FIELD\_RANGES
    This parameter passes an internal table with the [ranges tables](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenranges_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") generated according to the dynamic selections and that can be evaluated using the predicate [relational operator](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenrelational_operator_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") IN in corresponding [WHERE conditions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenwhere_logexp_list.htm) or [comparison expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenlogexp_select_option.htm).

-   EXPRESSIONS
    This parameter passes an internal table with conditions generated according to the dynamic selections in an internal format (Reverse Polish Notation). This format can then be passed to the function module FREE\_SELECTIONS\_INIT to prepare a selection screen that is predefined with these selections. This format is also required for passes made to called programs using the addition [WITH FREE SELECTIONS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapsubmit_selscreen_parameters.htm) of the statement [SUBMIT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapsubmit.htm).

For more information, see the documentation about function modules and their parameter interface.

Description

This example shows the simplest way to use a [dynamic selection](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenfree_selections.htm) in a program. When the value "T" of the parameter KIND is passed, the function module FREE\_SELECTIONS\_INIT is configured so that dynamic selections are prepared for database tables in ABAP Dictionary. The names of the database tables (here only one dynamically selectable table) are passed to the table parameter tables\_tab.

The result of FREE\_SELECTIONS\_INIT is passed to the function module FREE\_SELECTIONS\_DIALOG, which displays a selection screen for entering dynamic selections for the database table. The user can select which database fields are used for dynamic selections, and can then make these selections.

Once the user confirms the selected dynamic selections by choosing Save, the program inherits them as a dynamic WHERE clause and then uses this clause in a dynamic SELECT statement to read the data accordingly. The result is displayed in an ALV list.

The method CHECK\_TABLE\_NAME\_STR of the class CL\_ABAP\_DYN\_PRG checks whether the database table specified exists and can be used.

EDITOR-CALL FOR itab

[Quick Reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapeditor-call_shortref.htm)

Obsolete Syntax

EDITOR-CALL FOR itab *\[*TITLE title*\]*
                     *\[**{*DISPLAY-MODE*}**|**{*BACKUP INTO jtab*}**\]*.

Extras:

[1\. ... TITLE title](#!ABAP_ADDITION_1@1@)
[2\. ... DISPLAY-MODE](#!ABAP_ADDITION_2@2@)
[3\. ... BACKUP INTO jtab](#!ABAP_ADDITION_3@3@)

Effect

This statement passes the content of the internal table itab to a text editor and starts this text editor. The internal table has to be a [standard table](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenstandard_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") without [secondary table keys](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensecondary_table_key_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") with a character-like row type.

The text editor is based on a GUI control displayed in the current GUI window and has its own GUI status, part of which is the same as in ABAP Editor. The text editor has, depending its configuration, a line width of 255 or 72 characters. This setting can be made in the GUI status and also applies to ABAP Editor.

The content of the table rows is converted row by row in accordance with the [conversion rules for elementary data types](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenconversion_elementary.htm) into a field of the type c with length 255 or 72 and passed to the text editor. If the text editor is exited using the function Save, the previous content of the table is deleted and the content of each row of the editor is appended (from top to bottom) to the internal table. If necessary, this process involves a conversion of the type c of length 255 or 72 to the row type of the internal table.

Return Value

sy-subrc

Meaning

0

The text editor was exited using the Save function after the content was modified.

2

The text editor was exited using the Save function and no content was modified.

4

The text editor was not exited using the Save function.

Note

This statement is replaced when using [Control Framework](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencontrol_framework_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). Here, the class CL\_GUI\_TEXTEDIT wraps the corresponding [GUI control](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abengui_control_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Addition 1

... TITLE title

Effect

A character-like data object title can be specified after the addition TITLE. The first 50 characters of title are displayed in the header of the text editor.

Addition 2

... DISPLAY-MODE

Effect

If the addition DISPLAY-MODE is specified, the text editor is started in display mode.

Note

The text editor is started in display mode but can be toggled to change mode using a key combination.

Addition 3

... BACKUP INTO jtab

Effect

If the addition BACKUP INTO is specified, the content of the internal table itab is assigned to an internal table jtab before the text editor is called. jtab can have any table category. The row types have to be [compatible](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencompatible_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or [convertible](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenconvertible_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Example

Calls a text editor for a table with text rows. The processing in the IF control structure is only executed if the content of the table was actually modified; sy-subrc = 0 does not necessarily indicate this.

TYPES text   TYPE c LENGTH 255.
DATA: text\_tab TYPE TABLE OF text,
      back\_tab LIKE text\_tab.
EDITOR-CALL FOR text\_tab BACKUP INTO back\_tab.
IF sy-subrc = 0 AND
   text\_tab <> back\_tab.
  ...
ENDIF.

EDITOR-CALL FOR REPORT

[Quick Reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapeditor-call_shortref.htm)

Obsolete Syntax

EDITOR-CALL FOR REPORT prog *\[*DISPLAY-MODE*\]*.

Addition:

[... DISPLAY-MODE](#!ABAP_ONE_ADD@1@)

Effect

This statement starts ABAP Editor for the source code of the program specified in prog. prog has to be a character-like data object, which contains the name of a program in uppercase letters that exists in the [repository](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenrepository_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). If not, a message is displayed in the status line.

Once ABAP Editor is started, it offers the full range of functions (as when called in ABAP Workbench or the [ABAP Development Tools (ADT)](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenadt_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")). Forward navigation to other tools is also possible. After returning from ABAP Editor, the current program continues after the statement EDITOR-CALL.

Notes

-   If an inactive version of the program exists, this version is loaded.
    
-   This statement bypasses the authorization checks triggered when using a transaction code to call ABAP Editor, however the editor still checks the development authorization of the user in question.
    
-   The statement EDITOR-CALL FOR REPORT calls the function module EDITOR\_PROGRAM internally for the specified program prog, which starts the editor in the current environment (SAP GUI or Eclipse), including the required authorization checks.
    
-   Do not use this method of calling ABAP Editor any longer. Instead, use official ABAP Workbench interfaces, such as the function module RS\_TOOL\_ACCESS. If only the properties of the editor control are needed, the GUI class CL\_GUI\_SOURCEEDIT or its subclass CL\_GUI\_ABAPEDIT is used.
    

Addition

... DISPLAY-MODE

Effect

In the default setting, ABAP Editor is started in change mode. The addition DISPLAY-MODE causes ABAP Editor to start in display mode.

Note

ABAP Editor is started in display mode but can be switched to change mode.

[2\. ... DISPLAY-MODE](#!ABAP_ADDITION_2@2@)
[3\. ... BACKUP INTO jtab](#!ABAP_ADDITION_3@3@)

Effect

This statement passes the content of the internal table itab to a text editor and starts this text editor. The internal table has to be a [standard table](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenstandard_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") without [secondary table keys](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensecondary_table_key_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") with a character-like row type.

The text editor is based on a GUI control displayed in the current GUI window and has its own GUI status, part of which is the same as in ABAP Editor. The text editor has, depending its configuration, a line width of 255 or 72 characters. This setting can be made in the GUI status and also applies to ABAP Editor.

The content of the table rows is converted row by row in accordance with the [conversion rules for elementary data types](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenconversion_elementary.htm) into a field of the type c with length 255 or 72 and passed to the text editor. If the text editor is exited using the function Save, the previous content of the table is deleted and the content of each row of the editor is appended (from top to bottom) to the internal table. If necessary, this process involves a conversion of the type c of length 255 or 72 to the row type of the internal table.

Return Value

sy-subrc

Meaning

0

The text editor was exited using the Save function after the content was modified.

2

The text editor was exited using the Save function and no content was modified.

4

The text editor was not exited using the Save function.

Note

This statement is replaced when using [Control Framework](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencontrol_framework_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). Here, the class CL\_GUI\_TEXTEDIT wraps the corresponding [GUI control](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abengui_control_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Addition 1

... TITLE title

Effect

A character-like data object title can be specified after the addition TITLE. The first 50 characters of title are displayed in the header of the text editor.

Addition 2

... DISPLAY-MODE

Effect

If the addition DISPLAY-MODE is specified, the text editor is started in display mode.

Note

The text editor is started in display mode but can be toggled to change mode using a key combination.

Addition 3

... BACKUP INTO jtab

Effect

If the addition BACKUP INTO is specified, the content of the internal table itab is assigned to an internal table jtab before the text editor is called. jtab can have any table category. The row types have to be [compatible](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencompatible_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or [convertible](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenconvertible_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Example

Calls a text editor for a table with text rows. The processing in the IF control structure is only executed if the content of the table was actually modified; sy-subrc = 0 does not necessarily indicate this.

TYPES text   TYPE c LENGTH 255.
DATA: text\_tab TYPE TABLE OF text,
      back\_tab LIKE text\_tab.
EDITOR-CALL FOR text\_tab BACKUP INTO back\_tab.
IF sy-subrc = 0 AND
   text\_tab <> back\_tab.

EDITOR-CALL FOR REPORT

[Quick Reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapeditor-call_shortref.htm)

Obsolete Syntax

EDITOR-CALL FOR REPORT prog *\[*DISPLAY-MODE*\]*.

Addition:

[... DISPLAY-MODE](#!ABAP_ONE_ADD@1@)

Effect

This statement starts ABAP Editor for the source code of the program specified in prog. prog has to be a character-like data object, which contains the name of a program in uppercase letters that exists in the [repository](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenrepository_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). If not, a message is displayed in the status line.

Once ABAP Editor is started, it offers the full range of functions (as when called in ABAP Workbench or the [ABAP Development Tools (ADT)](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenadt_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")). Forward navigation to other tools is also possible. After returning from ABAP Editor, the current program continues after the statement EDITOR-CALL.

Notes

-   If an inactive version of the program exists, this version is loaded.
    
-   This statement bypasses the authorization checks triggered when using a transaction code to call ABAP Editor, however the editor still checks the development authorization of the user in question.
    
-   The statement EDITOR-CALL FOR REPORT calls the function module EDITOR\_PROGRAM internally for the specified program prog, which starts the editor in the current environment (SAP GUI or Eclipse), including the required authorization checks.
    
-   Do not use this method of calling ABAP Editor any longer. Instead, use official ABAP Workbench interfaces, such as the function module RS\_TOOL\_ACCESS. If only the properties of the editor control are needed, the GUI class CL\_GUI\_SOURCEEDIT or its subclass CL\_GUI\_ABAPEDIT is used.
    

Addition

... DISPLAY-MODE

Effect

In the default setting, ABAP Editor is started in change mode. The addition DISPLAY-MODE causes ABAP Editor to start in display mode.

Note

ABAP Editor is started in display mode but can be switched to change mode.

EDITOR-CALL FOR itab

[Quick Reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapeditor-call_shortref.htm)

Obsolete Syntax

EDITOR-CALL FOR itab *\[*TITLE title*\]*
                     *\[**{*DISPLAY-MODE*}**|**{*BACKUP INTO jtab*}**\]*.

Extras:

[1\. ... TITLE title](#!ABAP_ADDITION_1@1@)
[2\. ... DISPLAY-MODE](#!ABAP_ADDITION_2@2@)
[3\. ... BACKUP INTO jtab](#!ABAP_ADDITION_3@3@)

Effect

This statement passes the content of the internal table itab to a text editor and starts this text editor. The internal table has to be a [standard table](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenstandard_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") without [secondary table keys](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensecondary_table_key_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") with a character-like row type.

The text editor is based on a GUI control displayed in the current GUI window and has its own GUI status, part of which is the same as in ABAP Editor. The text editor has, depending its configuration, a line width of 255 or 72 characters. This setting can be made in the GUI status and also applies to ABAP Editor.

The content of the table rows is converted row by row in accordance with the [conversion rules for elementary data types](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenconversion_elementary.htm) into a field of the type c with length 255 or 72 and passed to the text editor. If the text editor is exited using the function Save, the previous content of the table is deleted and the content of each row of the editor is appended (from top to bottom) to the internal table. If necessary, this process involves a conversion of the type c of length 255 or 72 to the row type of the internal table.

Return Value

sy-subrc

Meaning

0

The text editor was exited using the Save function after the content was modified.

2

The text editor was exited using the Save function and no content was modified.

4

The text editor was not exited using the Save function.

Note

This statement is replaced when using [Control Framework](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencontrol_framework_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). Here, the class CL\_GUI\_TEXTEDIT wraps the corresponding [GUI control](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abengui_control_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Addition 1

... TITLE title

Effect

A character-like data object title can be specified after the addition TITLE. The first 50 characters of title are displayed in the header of the text editor.

Addition 2

... DISPLAY-MODE

Effect

If the addition DISPLAY-MODE is specified, the text editor is started in display mode.

Note

The text editor is started in display mode but can be toggled to change mode using a key combination.

Addition 3

... BACKUP INTO jtab

Effect

If the addition BACKUP INTO is specified, the content of the internal table itab is assigned to an internal table jtab before the text editor is called. jtab can have any table category. The row types have to be [compatible](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencompatible_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or [convertible](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenconvertible_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Example

Calls a text editor for a table with text rows. The processing in the IF control structure is only executed if the content of the table was actually modified; sy-subrc = 0 does not necessarily indicate this.

TYPES text   TYPE c LENGTH 255.
DATA: text\_tab TYPE TABLE OF text,
      back\_tab LIKE text\_tab.
EDITOR-CALL FOR text\_tab BACKUP INTO back\_tab.
IF sy-subrc = 0 AND
   text\_tab <> back\_tab.
  ...
ENDIF.

Separation of Concerns

Background

The term 'separation of concerns' (SoC) was coined in Edsger W. Dijkstra's article On the role of scientific thought from 1974:

"... But nothing is gained --on the contrary!-- by tackling these various aspects simultaneously. It is what I sometimes have called 'the separation of concerns', which, even if not perfectly possible, is yet the only available technique for effective ordering of one's thoughts, that I know of. This is what I mean by 'focusing one's attention upon some aspect': it does not mean ignoring the other aspects, it is just doing justice to the fact that from this aspect's point of view, the other is irrelevant." (Springer-Verlag, 1982)

Separation of concerns is a principle used in programming to separate an application into units, with minimal overlapping between the functions of the individual units. The separation of concerns is achieved using modularization, encapsulation and arrangement in software layers.

Although the classic three-layer architecture of the SAP system - now named SAP NetWeaver Application Server ABAP (AS ABAP) - is ideal for ABAP programming based on the SoC principle, this possibility was never explored. Application programs (in other words, dialog programs in module pools or reports in executable programs) were usually displayed as monolithic blocks, in which the system simultaneously reacted to user actions of the presentation layer, completed the application logic and executed accesses to data on the persistency layer. This type of programming is no longer relevant in today's programming world, where concepts like service-oriented architecture (SOA) set the trend.

Rule

Follow the SoC principle

Follow the separation of concerns principle. Model your applications strictly as service-oriented applications. It is especially important that you separate the logic of the application layer from the logic of the presentation layer, the persistency layer and the logic for communication with external systems. Encapsulate the repository objects of the individual concerns in separate packages.

Details

The SoC principle identifies the parts of an application with a specific purpose and encapsulates these parts in closed units. These units only communicate with each other using specified interfaces. Thanks to this principle, the software - which would have otherwise been overcomplicated - is divided up into manageable components. As a result, the software is:

-   more stable

-   easier to understand

-   easier to reuse

-   easier to transport

-   easier to maintain

-   easier to test

Regarding the last point, it would even be true to say that following the SoC principle is a prerequisite for executing isolated, automated [unit tests](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencorrectness_quality_guidl.htm "Guideline").

Bad Example

The following graphic shows two examples of an ABAP application that do not follow the SoC principle.

![Figure](abdoc_soc_bad.jpg)

In fact, the two bad examples here are the programmer models for reporting and dialog programming that were propagated by SAP for a considerable length of time! To be more precise, the example is not bad due to the reporting or programming of transactions itself, but due to the way in which these applications are usually implemented. The mini report in the following source code is a typical example of how different concerns are mixed together in a single program unit. Both the data declarations and the implementation of the functions are mixed together. Access to persistent data, data processing, data presentation and the associated declarations all occur in one single unit.

REPORT z\_non\_soc\_report.

PARAMETERS p\_carrid TYPE spfli-carrid.

DATA: spfli\_tab TYPE STANDARD TABLE OF spfli
      alv     TYPE REF TO cl\_salv\_table,
      alv\_exc TYPE REF TO cx\_salv\_msg.

SELECT \*
       FROM spfli
       WHERE carrid = @p\_carrid
       INTO TABLE @spfli\_tab.

IF sy-subrc = 0.
  SORT spfli\_tab BY cityfrom cityto.
  TRY.
      cl\_salv\_table=>factory(
        IMPORTING r\_salv\_table = alv
        CHANGING t\_table = spfli\_tab ).
      alv->display( ).
    CATCH cx\_salv\_msg INTO alv\_exc.
      MESSAGE alv\_exc TYPE 'I' DISPLAY LIKE 'E'.
  ENDTRY.
ENDIF.

Of course, it would be too much to insist that concerns should be completely separated even in short programs like in the source code above. However, real applications are usually very long ABAP programs (executable programs, module pools), in which all concerns are handled at the same time. If modularization was performed, it was usually restricted to reusing functional units and was rarely focused on the actual available layers. In addition, large volumes of global data were usually created that were used in different procedures and layers. As a result, all the parts of the program were inherently dependent on each other and could not be tested individually. We are convinced that the quality of these programs can be improved not only by following naming conventions, but also by changing the paradigm for the procedure used for programming tasks.

The following source codes proves that you can implement the SoC principle using classic ABAP procedural methods (in this case, subroutines). This source code works in the same way as the source code above. However, all the concerns are implemented in separate procedures that are assigned to layers. As we have already mentioned, this type of implementation would be too much for a simple program. However, if you needed to test the concerns in the above source code individually and independently of each other by using unit tests, the only possibility would be to adapt the source code as shown below. The program of the following source code can now be easily assigned test methods in ABAP unit test classes, which test the individual procedures.

ENDFORM.

     USING table TYPE spfli\_tab.
  DATA: alv     TYPE REF TO cl\_salv\_table,
        alv\_exc TYPE REF TO cx\_salv\_msg.
  TRY.
     cl\_salv\_table=>factory(
       IMPORTING r\_salv\_table = alv
       CHANGING t\_table = table ).
     alv->display( ).
   CATCH cx\_salv\_msg INTO alv\_exc.
     MESSAGE alv\_exc TYPE 'I' DISPLAY LIKE 'E'.
  ENDTRY.
ENDFORM.

ENDFORM.

              arc     TYPE sy-subrc.
  SELECT \*
         FROM spfli
         WHERE carrid = @carrid
         INTO TABLE @table.
  arc = sy-subrc.
ENDFORM.

However, this separation of concerns using subroutines shown above does not create a good impression. The following source code shows how the separation of concerns should be implemented instead using methods in concern-specific classes.

Good Example

The following graphic shows how an ABAP application should look that follows the separation of concerns.

![Figure](abdoc_soc_good.jpg)

After the concerns have been identified, they are implemented in ABAP object classes. The concerns shown in the graphic are the main tasks that are usually performed in ABAP application programming:

-   Communication with a user interface (UI) using UI services

-   Actual application logic

-   Access to persistent data using persistency services

-   Communication with external systems using proxy services

These main rules can be subdivided further, which is often necessary.

The boxes for the individual concerns in the graphic represent packages. All the repository objects (classes, data types) belonging to a concern should be located in corresponding packages. The package concept (encapsulated packages) supports this separation of concerns. In encapsulated packages, repository objects in one package can only access the objects of another package using package interfaces, which is checked by the syntax check. A package can restrict the usability of its repository objects even more by using access control lists. Subdividing the separation of concerns in a package is a concept supported by subpackages.

For example, encapsulating all database tables of an application in a package for persistency services prevents any program, that does not belong to this package, from accessing these database tables. The reverse is also true. For example, programs in the persistency layer cannot communicate directly with components in the presentation layer, such as a Web Dynpro ABAP application. You should prepare the package encapsulation (by choosing Package Check as Server) in the package properties. These packages have package interfaces, A package check is performed during the extended program check.

The following source code shows how to adapt the separation of concerns from the above source code for classes local to the program.

At first glance, the above source code appears to be very excessive compared to the first source code. But only on the first glance. A real application program usually only consists of 25 lines. The larger and more realistic the application program, the smaller the proportion of the overhead that is incurred by wrapping the concerns in classes. If the reuse options for [ABAP Objects](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenabap_obj_progr_model_guidl.htm "Guideline") are used appropriately, it is even possible to reduce the amount of source code.

In addition, the individual steps are now wrapped in classes, in other words, real program units (unlike in the second source code). In practice, wrapping is not performed in one single program, but in global classes that are assigned to different packages, depending on the layer. These packages are connected to each other using package interfaces. It is only by using these interfaces that you can achieve the other benefits of separating the concerns (in addition to the testing capability achieved in the second source code).

KISS Principle

Background

The KISS principle says that you should always choose the simplest solution for a problem. KISS is an acronym and can have any of the following meanings (the list is not exhaustive):

-   Keep it simple, stupid.

-   Keep it small and simple.

-   Keep it sweet and simple.

-   Keep it simple and straightforward.

-   Keep it short and simple.

-   Keep it simple and smart.

-   Keep it strictly simple.

The basic statement of the KISS principle is similar to Occam’s razor, which says that in science the preferred theory is the one that makes fewest assumptions to explain observations (see Wikipedia entry on the KISS principle).

Rule

Follow the KISS principle

Follow the KISS principle, and limit the complexity of your programs as far as possible.

Details

The best solution to a problem is usually the one that is as simple, minimalist, and easy to understand as possible, while ensuring stability, understandability, and maintainability in addition to functional correctness.

There are plenty of bad examples of the KISS principle. Why is this?

-   Programs are too complex right from the start. This can be due to poor design or simply a rash, undisciplined programming style.

-   Programs are maintained for lengthy periods. Instead of creating new implementations for old and new functions together, new functions are simply added (usually using IF control structures) to old functions. Programs that were initially simple thus become ever more complex, although this is not justified by the complexity of the task at hand.

To develop according to the KISS principle, you should ensure right from the start that the complexity of the program remains manageable. Rules that support this approach relate to the [structure and style](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenstructure_style_guidl.htm "Guideline") of programs, in particular [comments](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencomments_guidl.htm "Guideline") and [complexity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencomplexity_guidl.htm "Guideline").

Note

If existing programs do not follow the KISS principle, and these programs need to be further developed, we recommend refactoring as appropriate. Refactoring refers to the process of manually or automatically improving the structure of programs while retaining the observable program behavior. It improves legibility, understandability, maintainability, and extensibility, as well as considerably reducing the related effort for troubleshooting and functional enhancements (see Wikipedia entry on refactoring). The (incremental) refactoring of an existing program is not only useful for following the above rule, but also for all following rules.

The refactoring of existing code is supported by the required coverage by [unit tests](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencorrectness_quality_guidl.htm "Guideline"). Comprehensive unit tests can ensure that a program behaves in the same way after the refactoring process.

Example

The figure below shows the structure of a method that does not follow the KISS principle. The method consists of approximately 160 statements and reaches a [nesting depth](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abennesting_depth_guidl.htm "Guideline") of 12 levels. The method, which is only illustrated schematically, is a real example from a live ABAP program, which reached the state shown on the left after continuous additional developments. The method had become so complex that it was practically impossible to make another necessary change, and the developer was forced to refactor in line with the KISS principle.

![Figure](abdoc_kiss.jpg)

The result is illustrated on the right of the figure. By splitting the method M into three methods, each with less than 100 statements and a maximum nesting depth of 5 levels, manageable modularization units were created, which follow the rules for [complexity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencomplexity_guidl.htm "Guideline"), and allow the required modification to be made. Ideally, however, the state shown on the left side of the figure should never occur.

Correctness and Quality

Background

Most organizations that develop professional software have product standards that must be adhered to. These product standards define what is meant by correctness and quality of a program. SAP has many such standards, which development departments have to comply with. The current product standards that are most important to developers are listed below:

-   Accessibility
    In the information technology environment, the term accessibility relates to the requirement that anyone, including and especially those with impairments, can access and use information technology products. To make products such as software or websites accessible to all consumers, they must be created and designed so that they can still be used if users have a particular impairment (for example, visual impairment, color blindness) and must be compatible with technologies such as screen readers and screen magnifiers.

-   Documentation
    As a rule, a product standard for documentation defines which documents have to be shipped to the consumer with the product and ensures that the documentation supplied is consistent, correct, and up to date across all product areas.

-   Functional Correctness
    The functional correctness of software is generally seen as its most important quality. Software that is not functionally correct is usually unusable. As a rule, a product standard for functional correctness requires software to be error-free, and defines the stability of interfaces and program behavior during upgrades. To reach these goals, thorough testing of the software may be made compulsory.

-   Globalization
    If software is to be used worldwide, a product standard for globalization is usually necessary. This covers the aspects of internationalization and localization.

-   Internationalization
    Internationalization comprises the technical aspects of globalization such as Unicode compatibility, text processing, screen display, printing, data exchange, time zones, translatability, and so on, and thus sets out the technical prerequisites for localization. The translation of user interfaces and other texts is also, of course, an important aspect of internationalization.

-   Localization
    Localization is necessary if software for global use has to be adapted to local (usually country-specific) conditions, such as legal requirements or particular business procedures.

-   Performance
    Even if a program is functionally correct, it is of little or no use to a user if it cannot be executed in a reasonable time. A performance product standard ensures that this aspect is not neglected. It can include, for example, rules for efficient database access and scalability of application logic.

-   Security
    Where security is critical to software, and this is generally the case for any type of business software, a product standard for security sets out all security-relevant aspects of a product, by pointing out any potential security gaps or legal requirements, for example, and also contains instructions for meeting the standard.

-   Usability
    The term usability refers to the adaptation of user interfaces to the requirements of human end users and their tasks. A usability product standard should ensure that end users can perform their tasks efficiently and effectively. Key aspects of usability include consistency of user interfaces, ease of use, intuitive task-friendly and role-friendly interfaces, individual adaptability, error tolerance, and so on.

Although these standards are, in part, legal requirements, they essentially arise from the fundamental aim to guarantee the correctness and quality of the software that is shipped to consumers. Programming guidelines are very important in this respect. Many of the guidelines listed here support, directly or indirectly, one of the standards mentioned or are derived from them. They support and ensure compliance with such standards, resulting in correct, high-quality programs. The programming guidelines themselves could even be said to be on a par with binding product standards.

However, since not all possible product standards can be covered by the programming guidelines, for example all rules of a performance or security standard, we set out the following basic rule.

Rule

Comply with or check compliance with existing product standards

Adhere to the product standards that exist in your organization, and ensure the correctness and quality of your programs by testing them during development and after completion with all the test tools at your disposal.

Details

It is obvious that you must comply with product standards; this needs no further explanation. However, it is often forgotten that the static and dynamic analysis tools that are available in the ABAP environment can provide invaluable help for compliance with important product standards, particularly standards for functional correctness and performance. Therefore, as part of this basic rule we recommend that you use all available tools that help to ensure the correctness and quality of ABAP programs.

-   Perform the [extended program check](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenextended_program_check_guidl.htm "Guideline") (transaction SLIN) on a regular basis and correct all messages.

-   Use the [Code Inspector](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencode_inspector_guidl.htm "Guideline") tool (transaction SCI) on a regular basis using the standard check variant, and correct all messages.

-   Check the usability and accessibility of your interface elements by using the appropriate tools (integrated into the workbench tools and [ABAP Test Cockpit](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenabap-testcockpit_guidl.htm "Guideline")).

-   Cover all functions of your procedural units by using units tests with ABAP Unit (integrated into ABAP Workbench, Code Inspector, and ABAP Test Cockpit).

-   Cover all functions of your applications by using scenario tests with eCATT (transaction SECATT).

-   Check the memory consumption of your programs by using ABAP Memory Inspector (transaction S\_MEMORY\_INSPECTOR and the memory analysis function integrated into ABAP Debugger).

-   Check the runtime behavior and the performance. In SAP GUI use the ABAP runtime analysis (transaction SAT) and in the [ABAP Development Tools (ADT)](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenadt_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") use the ABAP Profiler.

-   Check the test coverage by using Coverage Analyzer (transaction SCOV and integrated into ABAP Unit Browser of ABAP Workbench).

-   Follow the [ABAP - Security Notes](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenabap_security.htm) to protect your programs and data from attacks from outside.

-   Document your programs and services using all available means: Starting with [comments](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencomments_guidl.htm "Guideline"), this ranges from simple data element documentation for context-sensitive input help, to class and method documentation for documenting APIs, to explanations of concepts and tutorials in other repositories such as SAP Knowledge Warehouse, or on the Internet, for example in the SAP Developer Community (SCN, http://scn.sap.com).

ABAP Test Cockpit ([ATC](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencts_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")) integrated into ABAP Workbench and the [Change and Transport System (CTS)](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencts_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") supports the execution and evaluation of the most important tests. Some of these tests also check compliance with some of the rules of the ABAP programming guidelines discussed later.

Note

Where in doubt, product standards take precedence over the guidelines and recommendations of this documentation. If, for example, performance or security aspects prohibit any of the programming practices presented here, compliance with the standard takes priority.

Good Example

Executing unit tests for classes of the package SABAP\_DEMOS\_CAR\_RENTAL\_APPL and displaying the results in ABAP Unit Browser of Object Navigator gives a test coverage of 100%. This package is shipped as a subpackage for the application layer of a small example application, which, in addition to unit tests, also demonstrates strict adherence to the [separation of concerns](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenseperation_concerns_guidl.htm "Guideline").

Programm Type and Program Properties

As soon as you create an ABAP program you make an important decision about its robustness and maintainability by selecting its program type and attributes. Among other things, the program type and program attributes determine how strict the syntax check is. Another important property of a program (as well as all other development objects) is its original language.

Program Type

Background

Every ABAP program has a program type that specifies which declarations and processing blocks a program can contain, and how it can be executed using the ABAP runtime environment. These are the possible program types in ABAP:

-   Executable program
    An executable program can contain all possible declarative statements. All processing blocks are possible except for function modules. The program supports classic dynpros and selection screens. It can be executed using the statement SUBMIT or using transaction codes. Executable programs are created in ABAP Editor.

-   Class pool
    A class pool always contains declarative statements for a global class. It can also include declarative statements for local types, interfaces, and classes. Only methods can be used as processing blocks. The pool does not support classic dynpros or selection screens. Global class methods can be called externally (depending on visibility) and public methods of the global class can be executed using transaction codes. Class pools are created using Class Builder.

-   Interface pool
    An interface pool can only contain the declarative statements for a global interface. Processing blocks, classic dynpros, and selection screens are not possible. Interface pools cannot be called or executed and are created using Class Builder.

-   Function group (function pool)
    A function group can contain all types of declarative statements. All processing blocks are supported except for the reporting event blocks. Classic dynpros and selection screens are supported. The associated function modules can be called, but it is also possible to access dynpro processing of the function group by using transaction codes. Function groups using Function Builder.

-   Module pool
    A module pool can contain all possible declarative statements. All processing blocks are supported except for reporting event blocks and function modules. The module pool supports classic dynpros and selection screens. It can be executed using transaction codes. Module pools are created using ABAP Editor.

-   Subroutine pool
    A subroutine pool can contain all possible declarative statements. The LOAD-OFPROGRAM event block, subroutines and methods can be used as processing blocks. The pool does not support classic dynpros or selection screens. The subroutines can be called, but it is also possible to execute methods using transaction codes. Subroutine pools are created using ABAP Editor.

-   Type group (type pool)
    A type group can contain the declarative statements, TYPES and CONSTANTS. Processing blocks, classic dynpros, and selection screens are not possible. Type groups cannot be called or executed. Type groups are created using ABAP Dictionary.

In addition to these compilation units (programs that can be compiled independently), include programs can also be used for [source code organization](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensource_code_orga_guidl.htm "Guideline").

In ABAP, a program execution means that the system loads a program into the memory and executes one or more of its processing blocks. A distinction is made between standalone and called program execution:

-   Standalone program execution
    When programs are executed as standalone programs, the program is started using a transaction code (statements CALL TRANSACTION and LEAVE TO TRANSACTION) or using the statement SUBMIT for an executable program. The statement SUBMIT also allows execution in a background process.

-   Called program execution
    In called program executions, a running program calls a procedure (method, function module, or subroutine) of another program. If necessary, this other program is loaded into the [internal session of the calling program](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenintern_extern_proc_call_guidl.htm "Guideline").

-   The program flow for standalone program execution depends on the selected program type and the type of program call:

-   If the program is called using a transaction, a distinction is made between object-oriented (OO) transactions and dialog transactions. For object-oriented transactions, the transaction code is linked to a method of a local or global class. This method defines the program flow. Dialog transactions, however, are associated with a classic dynpro of the program. In this case, the program flow is defined by the associated dynpro flow logic.

-   The program flow of an executable program that was started using SUBMIT is defined by the reporting process of the ABAP runtime environment. The runtime environment calls the different reporting event blocks (START-OFSELECTION, GET and END-OF-SELECTION) of the program.

-   The program type must be selected based on the technical program attributes described here and the requirements for program execution. Not all the program types mention here are appropriate for new developments.

Rule

Select the appropriate program type

To select the program type, proceed as follows:

-   The program type "class pool" or "interface pool" is automatically set for global classes and interfaces.

-   To implement completed functions that are to be displayed in the class library, use the program type "subroutine pool" can be used for local classes.

-   If required, the program type "function group" is set automatically for function modules. In addition, function groups must be used to wrap classic dynpros or selection screens.

-   If the programs needs to be executed within the scope of background processing, the executable program type is automatically set.

-   New module pools or type groups should no longer be created.

Details

The above hierarchy for selecting the program type is derived from the basic [rule](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenabap_obj_progr_model_guidl.htm "Guideline") described, which defines the use of ABAP Objects. The following list describes specific aspects in detail:

-   If ABAP Objects functions need to be provided across the whole package or system, this is done using global classes or interfaces that have the program type "class pool" or "interface pool" implicitly. The call is performed using a method call or an OO transaction (if a standalone program execution is required).

-   The "subroutine pool" program type can be used to implement completed functions called using a transaction code (not using a method call), and which do not require passed parameters and do not have a user interface. Only local classes are used for implementation. The program is called using an OO transaction. Subroutine pools - as the name suggests - were originally intended for subroutines that were called from other programs. Subroutines (and calling subroutines externally in particular) are declared as obsolete, according to the existing programming guidelines. Subroutine pools no longer have this purpose. Instead, subroutine pools are suggested as independent containers for local classes. This is because they are otherwise barely affected by implicit processes of the ABAP runtime environment.

-   Remote-enabled function modules (RFM) (which provide functions using the RFC interface across servers or across systems or are used for parallelization) can only be created in a function group. The implementation of the actual functions, however, is carried out in a class, for example in a local class within the [function group](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenfunct_module_subroutine_guidl.htm "Guideline").

-   The same applies to update function modules (which are called for the update using CALL FUNCTION IN UPDATE TASK) as to RFMs.

-   Programs with a [classic dynpro interface or selection screens](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenencap_class_interf_guidl.htm "Guideline") (if still required) should also be created as a function group. The function group only implements the UI but does not contain its own application logic (based on the [SoC principle](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenseperation_concerns_guidl.htm "Guideline")). This program type is suitable because it can contain both classic dynpros and an external functional interface in the form of function modules. The dialog modules of the function group called by the dynpro flow logic should only contain method calls, for instance, for methods of local classes.

-   An executable program includes multiple event blocks that are executed when the various reporting events occur. This form of event control is largely obsolete and should no longer be used. Executable programs should only be used where they are technically required, thus mainly for background processing. In this case, the actual implementation should also be carried out in methods, for example, methods of a local class within the executable program. The event block of the initial event, START-OF-SELECTION, should only contain a [method call](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendial_mod_event_block_guidl.htm "Guideline"). No other event blocks should be included anymore.

-   The module pool used to be the program type traditionally used for classic dialog programming with dynpros. The [Separation of Concerns](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenseperation_concerns_guidl.htm "Guideline") concept is not sufficiently supported by module pools. This is why no more new module pools should be created. Instead, any classic dynpros that are still required should be wrapped in function groups.

-   The type group program type was initially implemented as a temporary solution. This was because it was not always possible to define types for internal tables in ABAP Dictionary. The same applied to the global storage of constants. Both gaps have now been closed. In ABAP Dictionary, any types can be defined. In global classes and interfaces, types and constants can be created for package-wide or system-wide use. Therefore, the "type group" program type is obsolete, and no new [type groups](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendeclaration_dtypes_const_guidl.htm "Guideline") should be created.

Note

In cases where program types other than class and interface pools are still used, the check Obsolete Statements (OO Context) should be activated in the [extended program check](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenextended_program_check_guidl.htm "Guideline"). This enables same stringent syntax check to be implemented for program components not implemented in local classes as for within classes.

Program Attributes

Background

Alongside various, less important properties, each ABAP program has a set of program attributes that control specific aspects of the program behavior and syntax check severity:

-   ABAP language version
    for configuring the [ABAP language version](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenabap_version_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")

-   Fixed point arithmetic
    For respecting the decimal separator for operations with packed numbers.

-   Logical database
    For connecting an executable program with a logical database.

The program attributes are defined when a program is created the relevant tool (Class Builder, Function Builder, ABAP Editor). It is possible to change them later.

Rule

Use the default settings for program attributes

Set the program attributes for new programs as follows:

-   ABAP language version is [Standard ABAP (Unicode)](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenunicode_program_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or higher

-   Fixed Point Arithmetic activated

-   No assignment to a logical database

When a new program is created, these settings are the same as the default values. This means that they can be applied without making any changes. Once the program attributes are set they should no longer be modified.

Details

Different behaviors or check severities are only provided for compatibility reasons, to ensure that existing programs can still be compiled and executed. New programs should definitely not use obsolete settings.

-   When a new program is created, the ABAP Language Version attribute is already set to [Standard ABAP (Unicode)](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenunicode_program_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") by default. This attribute must never be set to [Obsolete ABAP (Non-Unicode)](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abennon_unicode_program_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). Only Unicode systems are supported in the current release, which means such programs can no longer be used. Higher [ABAP language versions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenabap_version_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") are possible because they cover the Unicode checks.

-   When a new program is created, the Fixed Point Arithmetic attribute is already set by default. This attribute must never be reset. If fixed point arithmetic is disabled, the position of the decimal separator of packed numbers (type p) is only respected for output in a classic dynpro, in assignments to fields of the types c and string, or for formatting using WRITE TO. The position is not respected for calculations. Today, this behavior only rarely meets the developer’s expectations. If the calculation is to be carried out with packed numbers without any decimal places, this must be specified using the DECIMALS 0 addition for the declaration.

-   When a new executable program is created, the Logical Database attribute is empty. This attribute assigns executable programs to a logical database. This enables the selection screen and flow of the program to be combined with the selection screen and flow of the logical database. A logical database is a special development object that is edited in Logical Database Builder and which provides other ABAP programs with data from the nodes of a hierarchical tree structure. A logical database has a hierarchical structure, an ABAP database program and a separate standard selection screen. Logical databases should no longer be used. This is because they are based on cross-program usage of global data, implicit subroutine calls and reporting event control, and therefore do not comply with modern concepts. The function module LDB\_PROCESS can be used to access existing logical databases. This function module can be called from a method. No new logical databases should be created. Instead a relevant service should be made available using a global class.

Because any later changes to the program attributes potentially involve extra work, the correct attributes should be configured right from the start and not changed later.

The following sections assume that fixed point arithmetic is always activated and that logical databases are not used.

Note

From Release 740, SP05, the [strict modes](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenopensql_strict_modes.htm) in the Open SQL syntax check require programs with the ABAP language version [Standard ABAP (Unicode)](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenunicode_program_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in which the program attribute [fixed point arithmetic](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenfixed_point_arithmetic_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is switched on.

Example

In the following source code performs a substring write across two numeric components of a structure.

METHOD ...
  DATA:
    BEGIN OF struct,
      comp1 TYPE i,
      comp2 TYPE i,
    END OF struct.
  struct+2(4) = 'XXXX'.
ENDMETHOD.

This was only possible for programs with the ABAP language version [Obsolete ABAP (Non-Unicode)](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abennon_unicode_program_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). Here an implicit [casting](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencasting_guidl.htm "Guideline") of the subarea is performed for type c. The result in the components depends on the alignment gaps, the internal presentation of numeric values (byte order), and the code page used. Therefore, the result is extremely platform-dependent. A live program must never contain this type of code. This type of code often produces data with errors or runtime errors that are difficult to trace.

The above code produces a syntax error when used in an ABAP program defined as [Standard ABAP (Unicode)](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenunicode_program_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or higher in the program attributes (in accordance with the above rule). Unwanted substring accesses are prohibited, just like any other unwanted accesses to structures or other parts of the working memory. If these accesses are not known to the syntax check, a runtime error occurs with a descriptive short dump while the program is running.

Original Language

Background

When a new repository object, such as a program, class, or database table in ABAP Dictionary, is created, its original language must be specified. This is specified implicitly as part of the current logon language. All translatable texts created as part of a development object in a development project (including descriptive short texts and long texts, the text elements of a program, and the documentation of data types or interfaces) are assigned the specified original language. The texts are created in other languages in a translation process (triggered by development) from the original language into the target languages.

Once specified, there is currently no technical support for the replacement of an original language by another language across an entire project.

Rule

Defining the Original Language at Project Level

Before implementation, consider carefully which original language you want to use for for your repository objects at project level. Developers may only create their development objects in the original language defined for this project (or occasionally subproject).

Details

Proceed as follows when defining the original language:

-   If all development groups involved in a project share a native language, then define this language as the original language of all development objects (this is known as monolingual development).

-   If the development groups are multilingual,

-   then the original language of all development objects is either a language understood by all developers involved (usually English, also called monolingual development)

-   or the original language of development objects in those parts of the project where the main developers share a native language is used (multilingual development).

Monolingual development groups are a best-case scenario, but are not always possible nowadays. The two possible scenarios for multilingual development groups, either monolingual or multilingual development, meet two different and contradictory requirements:

-   When you log on to a system in a language other than the original language, there is no effective way of working with development objects (either new or being developed) until a translation of the relevant texts has been created in the appropriate target language. Translation usually takes place in a follow-on translation system and has to be transported back to the development system. This means that an efficient development process is only possible if a single original language is defined at the beginning for the entire project, particularly in international development groups (often working in more than one location). All people involved in the development and validation process can then use the product, even if only for test purposes. If monolingual development is implemented in multilingual development groups, therefore, some (if not all) developers in a project need to create texts in a language other than their native language.

-   There are usually no tools or processes available for linguistic and stylistic checks on UI texts and documentation written by developers in a language other than their native language. Ideally, developers working on user dialogs and documentation should create texts in their native language and these texts should then be translated by trained translators into their own native language, using predefined terminology.

This second point is the reason why English is not required to be the one and only original language for all development projects, and why monolingual development groups should be free to work in their native language, with follow-on translation if required.

If a development group is multilingual, the original language of each development object must be decided case by case. Generally, the first point wins, since international development teams require monolingual development to be able to use their development resources most effectively for a particular project. In some cases, for example where subprojects require large volumes of text to be created, it could be best to define the native language of the developers as the original language. This is particularly relevant in SAP's in-house development teams, where many German-speaking developers continue to work.

In multilingual projects, it is best develop associated business functions in a single language (at least at package level). Table contents should also be created in a single language.

Note

The original language is defined as the logon language when a repository object is created, which is why the logon language is used intentionally for creating and editing repository objects.

Note

Regardless of whether a development project is monolingual or multilingual, consistent terminology must be defined for all texts created in the project and used across the board. In multilingual development projects, the translation of the terminology into the relevant languages should be completed before development start if possible, so that the terms can be used by the developers. The existing [standards](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencorrectness_quality_guidl.htm "Guideline") for UI texts and documents must also be followed.

Syntax Check

Background

The syntax check provides syntax errors and syntax warnings:

-   As soon as a syntax error occurs, the system stops the check and displays the relevant error message. In many cases, the system suggests a correction that can be applied. Programs with syntax errors can be activated, but they cannot be generated and executed. In the extended program check, the syntax errors are reported as fatal errors. Syntax errors must be corrected at all costs.

-   If a syntax warning occurs, the syntax check is not terminated. The program can still be executed. The syntax warnings are displayed in ABAP Editor after the syntax check and the [extended program check](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenextended_program_check_guidl.htm "Guideline"). Of course, testing tools that include the checks of the extended program check (such as Code Inspector and ABAP Test Cockpit) also display syntax warnings. When a program is activated, the system only displays syntax warnings if syntax errors have occurred at the same time. The warnings reported by the syntax check are subdivided into three priorities that are only displayed by the extended program check:

-   Priority 1
    Known errors that could cause program termination if the ABAP program is executed. This priority also includes all constructs that should not be used at all, because they indicate program errors and are very likely to make the program behave incorrectly.

-   Priority 2
    This priority refers to all constructs that do not necessarily cause incorrect behavior, but are obsolete, for example, and should be replaced by current constructs. Priority 2 errors can become priority 1 errors or syntax errors in future releases.

-   Priority 3
    Includes all errors where correction would be beneficial, but not necessarily essential, for the current release. However, the possibility of raising the priority in future releases is not ruled out.

The [severity of the ABAP syntax check](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenprogr_type_features_guidl.htm "Guideline") is determined by the decisions that were made when the program was created. As a result, program constructs that only cause syntax warnings outside of classes can actually indicate real syntax errors within classes. Selected syntax warnings can be suppressed by using pragmas. A pragma is a program directive that affects specific checks but does not influence the program flow.

Rule

Take notice of syntax warnings

Take all warnings of the ABAP syntax check seriously. Syntax warnings are not permitted in completed programs.

Details

The causes of syntax warnings must always be corrected because they generally produce unpredictable errors. These warnings are often reclassified as errors by SAP in subsequent AS ABAP releases. In this case, a program that initially only includes syntax warnings has incorrect syntax and can no longer be used after an upgrade.

Selected syntax check warnings can be hidden using pragmas. With respect to the package check, selecting Package Check as Server in Package Builder is the first step to achieving real encapsulation.. It enables consumers of development objects to modify their where-used positions before hard syntax errors occur. For this reason, all package check warnings must be corrected to ensure that the program's syntax remains correct, even after increased encapsulation of the packages used.

Bad Example

The following source code causes a syntax warning. An internal table is accessed using a freely specified key, even though a secondary key with the same components exists. This access performs a linear search.

FIELD-SYMBOLS <fs> TYPE spfli.
DATA itab TYPE HASHED TABLE OF spfli
          WITH UNIQUE KEY carrid connid
          WITH NON-UNIQUE SORTED KEY cities COMPONENTS cityto cityfrom.
...
READ TABLE itab WITH KEY cityfrom = '...' cityto = '...'
                ASSIGNING <fs>.

Good Example

The following source code corrects the above example. Here, the secondary key is used to access the table. The access performs a binary search. Hiding the syntax warning using the associated program primkey is not recommended here.

FIELD-SYMBOLS <fs> TYPE spfli.
DATA itab TYPE HASHED TABLE OF spfli
          WITH UNIQUE KEY carrid connid
          WITH NON-UNIQUE SORTED KEY cities COMPONENTS cityto cityfrom.
...
ASSIGN itab\[ KEY cities
             COMPONENTS cityfrom = '...' cityto = '...' \] TO <fs>.

Extended Program Check

Background

You can call the extended program check for activated programs either from ABAP Workbench or by using transaction SLIN. It performs static checks that are too complex for the normal syntax check. Both individual and multiple subtests can be performed, or an ATC check that includes important subtests.

The extended program check displays errors, warnings and messages. The ATC-relevant check reports errors and warnings that are particularly critical. These checks are also performed in program checks in [ABAP Test Cockpit (ATC)](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenabap_test_cockpit_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The classification of individual results (error, warning or message) depends on whether an ATC-relevant check is performed or explicitly selected individual checks. The extended program check also displays the errors and warnings of the syntax check.

In the initial screen of the extended program check, a programming guidelines check can also be selected. This checks whether certain rules presented in this book (that can be verified statically) have been adhered to.

The messages from the extended program check, which are inapplicable in some special cases, can be hidden using pragmas. Before the introduction of pragmas, it was not possible to hide messages raised by a normal syntax check.

Note

The extended program check also covers security checks used to test ABAP programs for all potential [security risks](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenabap_security.htm). In customer systems, these checks are subject to a special licensing procedure.

Rule

Use the extended program check

Use the extended program check and take the results seriously. Message are not allowed to appear when the ATC checks are performed for a completed program.

Details

The errors, warnings and messages output by the extended program check are just as important as the syntax errors and syntax warnings from the [syntax check](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensyntax_check_guidl.htm "Guideline"). For example, an error reported by the extended program check can indicate that a program will definitely lead to a runtime error when it is executed. Warnings and messages usually indicate a questionable use of language elements, which is likely to cause unexpected program behavior.

In rare cases, when a result reported by the extended program check is not justified, this must be documented using an appropriate pragma (the relevant pragma is indicated in the message). This means that the system suppresses the message of the extended program check. Ideally, in less obvious situations, an additional comment should be used to describe why the message is not applicable.

Note

The extended program check provides useful help for writing ABAP programs in the correct way. Using unspecific pseudo comments or pragmas can undo the positive effect of the extended program check. In particular, the following statement should never be used:

SET EXTENDED CHECK OFF.

This statement suppresses all messages of the extended program check for an entire source code section.

If the ABAP program is submitted to a code review, the results of the extended program check should be used to evaluate the quality.

Bad Example

If the following source code is checked using the extended program check, a warning appears. It indicates a particularly questionable query of the content of the [return value](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenreturn_value_guidl.htm "Guideline") sy-subrc.

ASSIGN field TO <fs>.
IF sy-subrc <> 0.
  ...
ENDIF.

The program section shows a typical error in a program with correct syntax. The developer wrongly assumes that the static form of the ASSIGN statement sets the sy-subrc system field, which is not the case. The developer wrongly believes that he has secured his program. An incorrect program behavior occurs if sy-subrc has a value that is not zero, due to previous statements. Therefore, the main advantage of the extended program check is that the system does not just examine individual statements for correct syntax, but it also examines entire program sections for semantic errors.

Good Example

The following source code shows the corrected version of the above example. The predicate expression IS ASSIGNED is used (as recommended in the documentation) instead of sy-subrc. The message from the extended program check could also be hidden using a pragma (##subrc\_read), but this is not recommended in this case because the extended program check indicates a real problem.

ASSIGN field TO <fs>.
IF <fs> IS ASSIGNED.
  ...
ENDIF.

Code Inspector

Background

The Code Inspector tool performs a static check of repository objects regarding performance, security, syntax, and adherence to naming conventions. Transaction SCI can be called to use the full range of functions of Code Inspector to perform complex static checks and regular mass tests for large numbers of development objects.

Code Inspector can also be called from ABAP Workbench to perform a standard set of checks for the current object, for example by choosing Program → Check → Code Inspector in ABAP Editor. The standard check variant used here contains most of the checks from the [extended program check](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenextended_program_check_guidl.htm "Guideline"), as well as a few additional security and performance checks. Code Inspector can also be integrated into the release of transports.

As in the extended program check, the results of Code Inspector are divided into three categories (errors, warnings, and simple messages), which you can hide using special pseudo comments.

Rule

Use the standard Code Inspector check variant

Perform the standard check variant of Code Inspector before releasing a program, and correct all error messages.

Details

If the [extended program check](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenextended_program_check_guidl.htm "Guideline") is used, the standard check variant of Code Inspector only reports messages and checks that are not covered by the extended program check. These are mainly messages relating to potential performance or security risks in programs. Examples are messages about unfavorable WHERE conditions in a SELECT, a pass by value instead of a pass by reference for parameters, or non-secure program calls.

Compared with the messages of the extended program check, it is not always so easy to correct these problems at their source, perhaps because there is no other option for a selection, or because the transparency or robustness of a construct is seen as more important than a small potential loss of performance.

In such cases, the messages can be suppressed using the appropriate pseudo comments. A pseudo comment is a clear indication to the reader of a program that the program author has performed the relevant checks and has explicitly suppressed the message for a good reason. If necessary, pseudo comments can be substantiated by additional normal [comments](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencomments_guidl.htm "Guideline").

Bad Example

A standard Code Inspector run for the example class below issues warnings because an internal table is returned by pass by value and an inner join for database tables with activated table buffering is used in the SELECT statement.

CLASS class DEFINITION FINAL.
  PUBLIC SECTION.
    TYPES: BEGIN OF docu\_wa,
             object   TYPE dokil-object,
             dokldate TYPE dokhl-dokldate,
             dokltime TYPE dokhl-dokltime,
           END OF docu\_wa,
           docu\_tab TYPE SORTED TABLE OF docu\_wa
                    WITH NON-UNIQUE KEY object.
    METHODS get\_docu
              IMPORTING VALUE(langu)     TYPE sy-langu
              EXPORTING VALUE(documents) TYPE docu\_tab.
ENDCLASS.
CLASS class IMPLEMENTATION.
  METHOD get\_docu.
    SELECT d~object, h~dokldate, h~dokltime
           FROM dokil AS d
           INNER JOIN dokhl AS h
             ON h~id         = d~id     AND
                h~object     = d~object AND
                h~typ        = d~typ    AND
                h~langu      = d~langu  AND
                h~dokversion = d~version
           WHERE d~id     = 'SD'     AND
                 d~object LIKE 'AB%' AND
                 d~typ    = 'E'      AND
                 d~langu  = @langu
           INTO CORRESPONDING FIELDS OF TABLE @documents.
  ENDMETHOD.
ENDCLASS.

Good Example

The source code below shows the corrected version of the above class, for which Code Inspector no longer issues any messages.

The pass by value of the internal table is replaced by a pass by reference. When passing the elementary parameter langu, the pass by value is left unchanged to ensure robustness. In the standard check used, it would not have triggered a warning in any case. If Code Inspector displays a warning in a case such as this, it can be hidden by using the pseudo comment "#EC CI\_VALPAR.

The inner join of the SELECT statement bypasses table buffering, which would cause performance problems if the method was called frequently. However let us assume (for purpose of this example) that the method is part of a larger application, where shared objects ensure that the selected data is buffered. In this case, the inner join should be used instead of other constructs with poor performance, such as a nested SELECT loop. As a result, the warning from Code Inspector is hidden using the pseudo comment #EC CI\_BUFFJOIN. The reasons for this are described in a regular comment.

CLASS class DEFINITION FINAL.
  PUBLIC SECTION.
    TYPES: BEGIN OF docu\_wa,
             object   TYPE dokil-object,
             dokldate TYPE dokhl-dokldate,
             dokltime TYPE dokhl-dokltime,
           END OF docu\_wa,
           docu\_tab TYPE SORTED TABLE OF docu\_wa
                    WITH NON-UNIQUE KEY object.
    METHODS get\_docu
            IMPORTING VALUE(langu)         TYPE sy-langu "#EC CI\_VALPAR
            EXPORTING REFERENCE(documents) TYPE docu\_tab.
ENDCLASS.

    SELECT d~object, h~dokldate, h~dokltime  "#EC CI\_BUFFJOIN

ABAP Test Cockpit

Background

ABAP Test Cockpit (ATC) is a framework that is integrated into ABAP Workbench; it simplifies considerably the handling of the tests required during development. ATC makes it possible to execute and display results for various tests on development objects, for example:

-   Extended program checks

-   Static performance tests

-   Module tests with ABAP Unit

-   Static usability tests

-   Package checks

-   Security checks

Whereas Code Inspector is only integrated into the development environment by way of the [standard check](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencode_inspector_guidl.htm "Guideline") and can otherwise only be used by calling a separate transaction, ATC is completely integrated into Object Navigator and Transport Organizer, and is available there for tests during development. ATC allows quality managers to perform mass tests. In the [ABAP Development Tools (ADT)](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenadt_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), some tests are provided only from ATC.

Rule

Configure and use ABAP Test Cockpit correctly

If ABAP Test Cockpit is available in your system, make sure that an ATC run is performed on all involved development objects and that no messages are displayed before you release the objects for transport. The ATC check should be integrated directly into the transport release.

Details

ATC is a tool that can be used both by SAP developers and as part of central quality assurance management. For example, if a developer checks all development objects of a package in the development system using the same ATC configuration used by a quality manager as part of a mass run in a consolidation system, he can go ahead and correct all messages without having to wait for feedback from the quality manager.

If ATC is configured correctly, the above rule includes the previous rules for [syntax warnings](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensyntax_check_guidl.htm "Guideline"), [extended program checks](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenextended_program_check_guidl.htm "Guideline"), and [Code Inspector](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencode_inspector_guidl.htm "Guideline").

Notes

-   More specifically, the security checks in the [extended program check](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenextended_program_check_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") can be executed and managed from ATC, which makes their integration into the transport release possible.

-   Outside of SAP, ATC is available from the following releases:

-   SAP NetWeaver AS ABAP 7.0, EhP2, Support Package 12

-   SAP NetWeaver AS ABAP 7.0, EhP3, Support Package 05

-   SAP NetWeaver AS ABAP 7.3, EhP1, Support Package 05

-   SAP NetWeaver AS ABAP 7.4, Support Package 02

Case

Background

In contrast to many other modern programming languages, ABAP is not case-sensitive for ABAP words (tokens of an ABAP statement that express its semantics; either ABAP keywords or additions) nor for operators and names of operands. The only exception is [dynamic programming](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenref_types_objects_guidl.htm "Guideline"), where the names of operands usually have to be specified in uppercase.

Rule

Do not mix uppercase and lowercase in names

Use only lowercase or uppercase in an individual token. Use uppercase for keywords and lowercase for operands.

Details

The usage of uppercase or lowercase for tokens, that is ABAP words and names, used to be a very important aspect for the formatting of the source code. Uniform case-sensitivity made it easier for the reader to distinguish keywords from names. Due to the source code coloring in the syntax in ABAP Editor, this aspect has become less important; however, the above rule is still valid because of the following reasons:

-   Source code coloring in the syntax is generally not visible when source code is printed. Therefore, uniform case-sensitivity is useful here for emphasizing the difference between keywords and names.

-   Since case-sensitivity in ABAP source code is not significant in the syntax outside of character literals (that is, text field literals in inverted commas (‘), string literals in backquotes (\`), and character string templates in vertical bars (|)), the ABAP development environment is not designed to maintain it permanently outside the mentioned constructs. Pretty Printer only offers the alternatives to use only lowercase or only uppercase, or to use either uppercase or lowercase for keywords and lowercase or uppercase respectively for names in operand positions.

Because of the second point, it does not make sense in ABAP to use uppercase and lowercase as a self-defined means of style. In other words, the names should not be written in mixed case style (also referred to as camel case style; see the following example), as is very popular in languages that are case-sensitive. A consistent notation cannot be ensured due to the missing relevance in the syntax. A mixed notation will be lost sooner or later when Pretty Printer is used, even if this is unintentional. Moreover, it possibly prevents other developers from using Pretty Printer after changes have been made to the source code. [Use of Pretty Printer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenuse_pretty_printer_guidl.htm "Guideline") is explicitly recommended.

Example

When the program PGL\_UPPER\_LOWER\_CASE is executed, source code is displayed in ABAP Editor; the upper part shows the declaration of a class with names in mixed case style or camel case style. Here, uppercase marks the beginnings of words within a combined name.

The code provided here as a bad example approximately follows the Java convention, and in the eyes of many beholders it might look better than the following good example. However, its appearance is less important than the technical restrictions mentioned, which do not currently allow naming like this. Executing Pretty Printer would irreversibly spoil the code's appearance because the names would then be illegible.

The lower part of the source code shows the declaration of a class in ABAP style, where which words within combined names are separated by underscores (\_). These separations cannot get lost when Pretty Printer is used.

Once the program has been called, the example is formatted according to the proposed Pretty Printer [setting](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenuse_pretty_printer_guidl.htm "Guideline"), with ABAP words in uppercase and operands in lowercase. Regardless of its configuration, the separation of the words in the names would be preserved after each execution of Pretty Printer.

Note

The built-in character string functions, to\_mixed and from\_mixed, allow conversions between names in ABAP style with underscores and names in mixed case style or camel case style, which can be helpful for data exchange with external systems.

Statements per Program Line

Background

An ABAP statement (declaration or executable statement) is closed with a period. This statement can be followed by further statements in the same line. Statements can also span multiple lines.

Rule

Maximum of one statement per program line

Write a maximum of one statement in every source code line. Long statements can and should be split at suitable places. This means the statements can be divided up across consecutive lines.

Details

Using multiple statements in one line makes the source code harder to read. If a line contains an entire control structure, the lack of indentations makes it especially difficult to identify the logical structure. Therefore you should try to avoid using more than one statement in a program line.

Besides reduced readability, using multiple statements in one line can also make the code more difficult to debug. Even in single steps, ABAP Debugger stops a maximum of once per executable program line. This makes it impractical for the debugging process if there is more than one statement in a line.

If a statement spans [multiple lines](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenline_width_guidl.htm "Guideline") (which occurs frequently due to the potential length of complex ABAP statements), there should be no empty lines between the parts of the statement. The breaks in the statement should occur at semantically suitable places so that groups with a similar semantic meaning are next to each other, if possible. Indentations should be used to ensure that the statement is as well structured and readable as possible.

Bad Example

The following source code shows a program section with correct syntax but that is poorly laid out and difficult to understand. Even the [Pretty Printer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenuse_pretty_printer_guidl.htm "Guideline") can barely improve the layout of the template displayed here.

CLASS class DEFINITION.
  PUBLIC SECTION. METHODS meth. ENDCLASS.

CLASS class IMPLEMENTATION. METHOD meth.
  DATA: itab TYPE TABLE OF dbtab, wa TYPE dbtab.
  SELECT \* FROM dbtab WHERE column = ' ' INTO TABLE @itab.
  IF sy-subrc <> 0. RETURN. ENDIF.
  LOOP AT itab INTO wa. ... ENDLOOP.
  ENDMETHOD. ENDCLASS.

Good Example

The following source code shows the same code as above but with the recommended limit of one statement per line. The complex SELECT statement contains numerous clauses and hence spans multiple consecutive lines.

CLASS class DEFINITION.
  PUBLIC SECTION.
    METHODS meth.
ENDCLASS.

CLASS class IMPLEMENTATION.
  METHOD meth.
    DATA: itab TYPE TABLE OF dbtab,
          wa   TYPE dbtab.
    SELECT \*
           FROM dbtab
           WHERE column = ' '
           INTO TABLE @itab.
    IF sy-subrc <> 0.
      RETURN.
    ENDIF.
    LOOP AT itab INTO wa.
       ...
    ENDLOOP.
  ENDMETHOD.
ENDCLASS.

Using Pretty Printer

Background

The alignment of ABAP statements in the source code is not defined in the syntax. There should be a [maximum of one statement per line](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenstatement_guidl.htm "Guideline"), which can be technically indented and wrapped as required. This makes control structures visible. By inserting blank lines, related source code sections can be grouped, which makes the code easier to read. Note that, in ABAP statements, blanks cannot be added or left out at random. For example, tokens must be separated by at least one blank (especially with operands and operators). In a method call, no blanks are permitted between the name of the method and the opening parenthesis.

Languages with a C-like syntax (where statement blocks within control structures are delimited by curly brackets) provide an inexhaustible source for discussions on how to best make indentations. However, for ABAP the solution is obvious: Every introductory statement (such as IF) has an associated concluding statement (in this case, ENDIF). Event blocks for ABAP runtime environment events are the only exception here. They are introduced by a statement (such as START-OF-SELECTION) but are not concluded with the associated concluding statement. Instead, they are concluded with the next event block. However, [event blocks](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenabap_obj_progr_model_guidl.htm "Guideline") should only be used in exceptional cases. Introductory and concluding statements are aligned at the same level; the block content is indented.

Pretty Printer can modify the indentation of control structures and the capitalization of keywords and names in the source code at any time (even in display mode).

Rule

Use Pretty Printer consistently and universally

Use Pretty Printer to format source code consistently. If Pretty Printer cannot format the code as required, manual changes are necessary.

Details

We recommend that the use of Pretty Printer to make indentations required to make the source code easy to read. This guarantees that the indentations are consistently based on the logical control structure and that the indentation depth is identical for each program. Implementing this type of formatting by hand is prone to errors and not recommended.

Even though Pretty Printer can be used to adapt the source code to any other style (using the available settings), a consistent and universal style should be selected. The reason for this is that version management and the correction workbench are not designed to ignore purely stylistic differences between source code versions. Therefore, the following Pretty Printer settings are recommended for consistent source code formatting. These settings cover the expectations and working habits of most ABAP developers:

-   Indent statements
    Absolutely essential for a logical program structure that is clearly visible. A [maximum of one statement per program line](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenstatement_guidl.htm "Guideline") is allowed.

-   Do not insert standard comments
    The standard comment only contains redundant information and it is not adapted, if the source code is changed.

-   Uppercase keywords
    Makes it easier to [understand the source code](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenlower_upper_case_guidl.htm "Guideline") in printed form. In this case, syntax color-coding is usually not visible.

The code needs to be edited manually, to ensure the correct use of blank lines between related source code blocks. Syntax units, such as classes, methods, control blocks, or semantic units of a program, should be separated from one another with one or two blank lines (depending on their size and meaning). However, there should not be more than two blank lines in succession.

Note

We recommend that the use of the Keyword Lowercase setting in Pretty Printer, for reasons of visual clarity. This is because repository object names and data objects names in the ABAP Debugger are displayed in uppercase, in all tools required for ABAP development. With the Keyword Lowercase setting, the source code format matches this display format. For example, reading COLUMN columns form a DBTAB database table:

select COLUMN1 COLUMN2 ...
       from DBTAB
       into corresponding fields of ITAB
       where COLUMN = FIELD.

Names in uppercase are also more suitable because many dynamic operand positions in ABAP still require uppercase. A good example is an almost static call of function modules. Using the Keyword Lowercase setting, the call of a function module FUNCTION\_MODULE would be as follows:

call function 'FUNCTION\_MODULE' exporting PARAMETER = FIELD.

However, the Keyword Lowercase setting was added to Pretty Printer relatively late and could not compete against the more common setting Keyword Uppercase. In addition, the ABAP syntax diagrams and sample programs in ABAP documentation, as well as all relevant publications, are formatted with the Keyword Uppercase setting. If we recommended the use of the Keyword Lowercase setting, this would lead to confusion and would not help the programming guidelines to be universally accepted.

Bad Example

The following source code shows the above example, but without indentations and only with lowercase. The highlighted ABAP words (shown in bold here and in color in the ABAP Editor) might not appear in a program printout. This would make the program even less legible.

class class definition.
public section.
methods meth.
endclass.
class class implementation.
method meth.
data: itab type table of dbtab,
wa type dbtab.
select \*
from dbtab
into table itab
where column = ' '.
if sy-subrc <> 0.
return.
endif.
loop at itab into wa.
...
endloop.
endmethod.
endclass.

Line Width

Background

The maximum line width of an ABAP program is restricted to 255 characters. The editor allows you to write more than 255 characters, but it breaks a line that contains more than 255 characters between two tokens when you press Enter.

Rule

Do not use full line width

Limit the width of a line in the source code to a reasonable size. As a rule of thumb, you should be able to print a program on common paper formats without truncation or line breaks.

Details

Whereas the old restriction to 72 characters was too strict, the full utilization of the 255 characters that are now available would not make a program any more legible. Although very large monitors are now available, it can still be necessary, for example, for code inspections or reviews, to print a program or program section. It is therefore advisable to break long [statements](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenstatement_guidl.htm "Guideline") at suitable positions and to distribute long literals across multiple lines using the literal operator (&) or the concatenation operator (&&).

Note

The example programs in the documentation are restricted in width in a natural way, which makes them legible at the same time. Unfortunately this sometimes means using shorter [names](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentelling_names_guidl.htm "Guideline") than would actually be possible.

Example

In the first method of the program PGL\_PROGRAM\_LINE\_WIDTH, a very long literal is assigned to the return value. The literal is not displayed completely even on very wide screens, and in the printout it will be broken up or even truncated.

The second method uses a literal whose content is identical to the one of the previous method; here, however, it is composed of multiple shorter literals using the literal operator &. The literal is split at appropriate positions, and the method becomes more legible both on the screen and the printout.

Naming

The naming of the repository objects defined outside of a program and of the entities declared within the program (such as data types, data objects, and procedures) is of vital importance for understanding and editing the program. All names used must be readable, easy to learn, and appropriate. You can meet these requirements by using meaningful names. It is also important to avoid naming conflicts.

-   [Choosing the Language](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenchoice_langu_guidl.htm "Guideline")

-   [Names of structure components](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenstruc_comp_names_guidl.htm "Guideline")

Note

These guidelines deliberately use the term naming and not naming conventions. The term "programming guidelines" is frequently equated with naming conventions. Many of the current programming guidelines are mainly concerned with the definition of prefixes and suffixes, which are more or less meaningful. However, we pursue a different approach here. Part of these guidelines is rightly dedicated to the discussion of meaningful names. However, this discussion does not represent the core of these guidelines.

A maintenance organization is responsible for maintaining monolithic ABAP applications that have evolved over time and that may include complex procedures without a clearly defined task, large quantities of global data objects and cryptic/misleading names. For this type of organization, the appeal for strict naming conventions with standardized prefixes and suffixes may be understandable. However, the current programming guidelines are designed to support the new development of robust ABAP programs, which can be developed and maintained cost-efficiently. Consequently, it would be wrong to insist on naming conventions (for new developments) that address problems in older code, which are excluded from the outset anyway, if the programming meets current standards.

The rules on naming listed below meet the requirements of modern ABAP development. The only disadvantage is that it is difficult to use automatic checks, to monitor whether these requirements are adhered to. Our rules address human readers (and not automated test tools), who want to understand ABAP programs and eliminate ambiguous elements as quickly as possible. With regard to older code, we recommend refactoring based on the basic guidelines presented here. This enables you to get down to the root of maintenance problems. If you simply try to retroactively change names in line with technical naming conventions, you are only attempting to cure the symptoms and not the problem itself.

Choosing the Language

Background

The natural language that has established itself worldwide for computer programming is English. This is because the language elements in all significant programming languages have been taken from English and their syntax based on English grammar. ABAP is no exception. In fact, efforts have been made to guarantee correct English by giving additions of related statements different names, even if they have the same meaning. Well-known examples include the (now obsolete) additions VARYING and VARY of the statements DO and WHILE. Here, ABAP can even be viewed as a subset of the English language.

Rule

Use English names

Give your repository objects and your local program objects names that use English words only

Details

Using names in a language other than English looks unnatural (and inelegant) in programming languages whose own language elements are all in English. As well as this, English names make the source code accessible to as wide an audience as possible. Finally, using a different language throughout your code would be difficult due to the large number of English technical terms used in today's IT environment.

In instances where British and American spelling differ, use the American spelling. This is often shorter and more commonly used in IT.

Note

This rule applies regardless of the [original language chosen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenoriginal_langu_guidl.htm "Guideline").

Bad Example

One of the most notorious examples of non-English names in ABAP is the component UZEIT of the structure SYST, plus its data element SYUZEIT. All other components (with the exception of the equally notorious DATUM (for date) and MANDT (for client)) are English terms or abbreviations.

Descriptive Names

Background

A name can include technical and semantic information:

-   Technical information can be very versatile. Examples of options in a data object: data type, declaration context, whether a procedure parameter is passed by value or by reference.

-   The semantic information indicates the purpose of classes or data types, the content of data objects, how methods work, and so on.

The technical information about a repository object or internal program entity can be viewed directly in ABAP Workbench. This information is also displayed in tooltips or can be displayed with a simple double-click. However, in contrast to purely technical type information, the semantics of a variable are more difficult to identify without the relevant information in the name.

Rule

Use descriptive names

Always choose names that include the semantic information required for your context and that also easy to understand.

Details

The aim is to assign descriptive and self-documenting names. You should always follow a problem-oriented approach instead of an implementation-oriented approach. For example, a truth value should not be named flag. Instead it should have a name that indicates its meaning, such as is\_checked.

When you select a descriptive, problem-oriented name, you should consider the following aspects in particular:

-   Appropriate use of nouns, verbs, and adjectives

-   Meaningful use of abbreviations

-   Appropriate separation of name components

These points are discussed in detail in the following sections. The purely technical information for a named object can be displayed quickly and easily, using double-click navigation in ABAP Workbench. Therefore, this information can be omitted from names and semantic information can be used in names instead.

Any organizations (within SAP or external) that want to specify technical information in addition to semantic information in names, can define their own naming conventions that are based on our semantic rules. However, we believe that encoding technical attributes in names is not suitable for making ABAP programs (developed according to the present guidelines) easier to understand and maintain. This may be different in the context of other programming languages with fewer types and less powerful development environments.

The use of nouns, verbs, and adjectives for naming depends on the entity that you want to name:

-   Packages and package interfaces
    A package comprises a collection of repository objects for a specific subject area. The package name can either consist of one or more singular nouns that describe the subject area (such as sabp\_compiler), or one or more plural nouns that indicate the contained objects (such as sabp\_analyze\_tools). Subpackages start with the name of the super package and contain suffixes that indicate the specialization. The name of a package interface starts with the name of the package. Information about visibility or restrictions to certain consumers are attached as an optional suffix. For example, \_public, stands for public interface and \_verification stands for interface to verification tools.

-   Data types, classes, and interfaces
    They denote categories of things and are therefore named using nouns, for example, cl\_abap\_codepage. The greater the degree of specialization, the greater the number of nouns required for description. This can result in longer, combined names, for instance, if\_abap\_string\_writer or cl\_abap\_xml\_name\_converter. If necessary, the name can be further specified with an additional adjective, as in if\_serializable\_object and cl\_abap\_weak\_reference. The name of a category is usually written in the singular form. Therefore, a class name should generally consist of singular nouns. However, there are many examples of deviations from this rule, such as cl\_abap\_ memory\_utilities. These classes often do not model a category but instead provide a hodgepodge of loosely related functions, usually in the form of exclusively static methods.

-   Associations
    An association refers to a semantic relationship between a start object and a target object. To make sure this relationship is unambiguous when an association is used in a path, you should prefix the association with TO\_. This should be followed by a name that contains the name of the target object (in the case of non-reflexive associations).

-   Variable data objects and procedure parameters
    These describe attributes and are therefore named with a noun, for instance, cl\_abap\_regex->pattern. Truth values are labeled using the is\_ prefix, which is consistent with natural language usage. If the attribute you want to describe is a quantity (usually an internal table in ABAP), this should be expressed using the plural. For example, the matches parameter of the cl\_abap\_matcher->find\_all method.

-   Constants
    From a technical point of view, these are data objects with non-modifiable values at program runtime. They describe special, non-modifiable attributes. Values of constants are described with nouns. They are distinguished by a specific attribute (such as minimum size, start value) expressed by one or more additional adjectives. Examples: cl\_abap\_exceptional\_values=>decfloat34\_max and cl\_abap\_format=>o\_extended\_monetary.

-   Events
    They are named using an expression in present perfect that describes their occurrence, for example, cl\_dd\_form\_element->button\_clicked and cl\_gui\_alv\_ tree->selection\_changed. In this example, the noun is abbreviated significantly (o for output format). More information about useful abbreviations can be found below.

-   Procedures
    New procedures are methods according to the [use ABAP objects](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenabap_obj_progr_model_guidl.htm "Guideline") rule. Here, we distinguish between different cases:

-   Event handlers are named after the corresponding event. They are assigned a prefix that identifies them as handler methods. In ABAP, the on\_ prefix has established itself. This is consistent with natural language use and clearly labels a method as an event handler. For the two event examples above, the names of the corresponding handler methods would be on\_ button\_clicked and on\_selection\_changed.

-   The name of methods with a return value (functional methods) describes the returned result. The get\_ prefix is added to describe the task of the method. An example of this is the cl\_abap\_exceptional\_values=>get\_max\_value method. If the method returns a truth value, is\_ is used as a prefix instead of get\_. In ABAP, these get\_ methods are intended to identify the return value (by using a calculation, for example). Unlike in Java, for example, no own methods should be used to simply return attribute values. Instead you should use the [write-protected (READ-ONLY) attributes](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenencapsulation_guidl.htm "Guideline") provided in ABAP.

-   In all other cases, the name of a method describes an activity to be performed. Therefore, the method name is a verb, generally expressed in the imperative. Examples: cl\_abap\_regex->create\_ matcher and cl\_abap\_memory\_utilities=>do\_garbage\_collection. Methods used to set attributes are described using the relevant attribute, which is prefixed with set\_. Other procedures ([function modules and subroutines](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenfunct_module_subroutine_guidl.htm "Guideline")) required to wrap method calls are named accordingly.

-   Exception
    Exceptions describe unexpected states. Technically they are classes. [Classic exceptions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenclass_exception_guidl.htm "Guideline") should no longer be used. Except for the prefix, the same considerations apply here. To distinguish exceptions from normal classes, they are assigned their [own prefix](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abennames_repos_obj_guidl.htm "Guideline") cx\_, provided that they are global exception classes. The name of an exception reflects the rejected state as clearly as possible, for instance, cx\_sy\_offset\_not\_allowed. If an entire hierarchy of exception classes exists, the names of the superclasses do not describe special exception situations. Instead they describe error categories (such as cx\_ sy\_data\_access\_error in this example).

You should avoid using abbreviations as name components wherever possible. Exceptions to this rule are abbreviations that are usually used instead of the complete term, such as GUI or XML. However, if the use of certain abbreviations cannot be avoided due to restricted space, you should initially use common abbreviations.

If no common abbreviation exists, you should proceed as follows: Vowels are omitted, unless they are the first letter of the word. They are of minor significance for the recognition value. If a word starts with a double vowel, both letters are kept for ease of recognition (for example, outbnd as the abbreviation for outbound instead of otbnd). If further abbreviations are required, you can replace double consonants with single consonants. Even after this step, the word is generally still recognizable.

An example of a poorly chosen abbreviation would be tstmp for timestamp. This abbreviation does not follow the above rules and is not intuitive. Readers would probably initially think of the possible components tst or tmp, which would remind them of test or temporary. However, an association to timestamp is in initially very difficult to identify. Therefore, if you create abbreviations, you must ensure that the result is not similar to another, possibly more common abbreviation for a completely different term.

When you create abbreviations in a foreign language, you run the risk that the result represents a word or abbreviation with a completely different meaning. If in doubt, you should enter the abbreviation in a search engine to check it. For example, you only have four characters available and you want to use the word button. In this case, you should select the abbreviation bttn (following the abbreviation rules above), instead of the first four characters.

As a rule, name components should be visually separated using underscores in ABAP. This makes the names easier to read. Separating name components with uppercase and lowercase (common in languages with C-like syntax) is [not useful](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenlower_upper_case_guidl.htm "Guideline") in ABAP. Underscores normally identify a name, because ABAP words are usually not formed this way. The only exceptions here are certain format options for character string templates (such as SCIENTIFIC\_ WITH\_LEADING\_ZERO), which can only occur within character string expressions, and certain additions of SELECTION-SCREEN and WRITE.

You should not use digits as name components. They are often a sign of poorly selected names (because they are not very descriptive) or indicate the use of multiple individual variables, where the use of an internal table would make more sense. Exceptions include the interface parameters of procedures. Numbering similar parameters definitely makes sense here.

The use of digits to form phonetic names is also problematic because they require a degree of familiarization, and their meaning is not always obvious to everyone. A particularly bad use of digits is the abbreviation trmn8r for terminator. The commonly used 2 for to is the only justifiable exception here. This is often found as a name component in conversion procedures and can be interpreted easily (convert\_itf\_2\_html, for example).

Note

You must always keep in mind that the information included in a name must remain valid. This applies to semantic information, but especially to technical information. If, for example, technical information included in a name changes due to a refactoring measure, all relevant names and their consumers must be modified. However, this is not an easy task in released interfaces. If in doubt, remember that names containing incorrect information are worse than names that do not provide any information at all. This is why programming guidelines exist that suggest only using nondescript names. Since semantic attributes are less likely to change in the course of (further) development than technical attributes, our predominantly semantic specifications for naming are relatively well safeguarded from program changes.

Note

Less is often more. Our suggestions indicate how to compose names to include the information that is necessary in a context. They should only be used when the meaning of the name is not completely obvious from the context. For example:

METHOD do\_something.
  CONSTANTS lcv\_maximum\_do\_loop\_count TYPE i VALUE 100.
  DO lcv\_maximum\_do\_loop\_count TIMES.
    ...
  ENDDO.
ENDMETHOD.

The long name lcv\_maximum\_do\_loop\_count is quite difficult to read. A method can only include a manageable [number of statements](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenproc_volume_guidl.htm "Guideline"). Therefore, you can select a very simple name in simple cases:

METHOD do\_something.
  CONSTANTS nmax TYPE i VALUE 100.
  DO nmax TIMES.
    ...
  ENDDO.
ENDMETHOD.

A further example of where short names are useful is help fields declared in [LET expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abaplet.htm).

Bad Example

The following source code shows the declaration of a class that executes arithmetic calculations. This should be understood as a synthetic naming example. Of course, in ABAP, it makes absolutely no sense to [wrap](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenmodularization_guidl.htm "Guideline") the arithmetic operations on elementary numeric data types using a class. The names of the class and its methods are unnecessarily short, and the names of the method parameters have no semantic meaning at all.

CLASS calcltr DEFINITION.
  PUBLIC SECTION.
    METHODS: add IMPORTING a        TYPE i
                           b        TYPE i
                 RETURNING VALUE(c) TYPE i,
             sub IMPORTING a        TYPE i
                           b        TYPE i
                 RETURNING VALUE(c) TYPE i,
             mul IMPORTING a        TYPE i
                           b        TYPE i
                 RETURNING VALUE(c) TYPE i,
             div IMPORTING a        TYPE i
                           b        TYPE i
                 RETURNING VALUE(c) TYPE f.
ENDCLASS.

Good Example

The following source code shows the same class as in the code above, but the names of the class and its methods are now spelled in full, and the names of the method parameters indicate their semantic meaning.

CLASS calculator DEFINITION.
  PUBLIC SECTION.
    METHODS: add IMPORTING addend1           TYPE i
                           addend2           TYPE i
                 RETURNING VALUE(sum)        TYPE i,
        subtract IMPORTING minuend           TYPE i
                           subtrahend        TYPE i
                 RETURNING VALUE(difference) TYPE i,
        multiply IMPORTING factor1           TYPE i
                           factor2           TYPE i
                 RETURNING VALUE(product)    TYPE i,
          divide IMPORTING dividend          TYPE i
                           divisor           TYPE i
                 RETURNING VALUE(quotient)   TYPE f.
ENDCLASS.

Because the addition and multiplication operands are commutative, you can use digits here to distinguish them.

Names of Repository Objects

Background

Repository objects are development objects edited using the tools in ABAP Workbench. Each repository object is assigned to a package. Packages encapsulate the repository objects contained and use package interfaces to make objects available that should be usable outside the package. This complies with the [SoC principle](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenseperation_concerns_guidl.htm "Guideline").

From a semantic point of view, packages represent a context for declarations, which is one level above the contexts of an ABAP program. Unlike the contexts of an ABAP program (programs, classes, procedures), a package does not generate a separate namespace.

The namespace for repository objects is defined as follows:

-   Prefix namespace
    Development organizations (SAP departments, SAP partners, and SAP customers) can request a [prefix namespace](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenprefix_name_space_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") for their own development systems. A prefix namespace has a name with at least 5 and a maximum of 10 digits, and the first digit and last digit must be slashes (/.../). After the namespace has been assigned, repository objects only can be created in systems, where the namespace is enabled by prefixing the namespace name /.../. If a package is created in this type of prefix namespace, it can only contain repository objects belonging to the same namespace. However, multiple packages can be created within a single prefix namespace. The available length for the actual name is reduced by the length of the [namespace prefix](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenname_space_prefix_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), including the slashes.

-   Customer namespace
    If no prefix namespace is available, the names of repository objects created in customer systems or non-SAP development systems must have Y or Z as the first character. This means they are located in the customer namespace. Repository objects whose names start with Z can also be located within packages whose names start with Y and the other way round.

-   SAP namespace
    If no prefix namespace is available, there are no real restrictions for the names of repository objects that are created in SAP’s own development systems. The SAP namespace comprises the entire AS ABAP. Regardless of the namespace where a repository object resides, the name of the repository object is unique in the current AS ABAP. Therefore, when the object is addressed, nothing else needs to be specified. The namespaces (particularly the prefix namespace) were implemented to avoid namespace conflicts during transports between systems and upgrades. For SAP’s own development systems, there is a cross-system table that ensures the uniqueness of names within the SAP namespace.

Note

The global types, namely the global [object types](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenobject_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the [class library](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenclass_library_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and the global [data types](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendata_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of [ABAP Dictionary](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenabap_dictionary_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") are in separate dedicated namespaces. They are always unique when used after REF TO.

Rule

Clarify the type and affiliation of repository objects in names

Use common naming conventions for repository objects. The predefined name prefixes, CL\_, IF\_, and CX\_, apply to objects of the class library. If possible, create all repository objects in the prefix namespaces only. In addition, use a naming convention to clearly indicate which package or component the objects belong to.

Details

Classes and interfaces are the most important entities for [programming with ABAP Objects](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenabap_obj_progr_model_guidl.htm "Guideline"). Either a class type or an interface type can be used to type a object reference. It is useful to uniquely flag these two types in the class library by means of a prefix. Global exception classes should also be uniquely identified by a prefix. The following naming conventions apply. These conventions are sometimes enforced by Class Builder but are sometimes only evaluated:

-   CL\_ for global classes

-   IF\_ for global interfaces

-   CX\_ for global exception classes

-   CL\_BADI\_, IF\_BADI\_, CX\_BADI\_ for classes, interfaces, and exception classes of Business Add-Ins (BAdI)

These naming conventions distinguish [object types](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenobject_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") from the global [data types](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendata_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of [ABAP Dictionary](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenabap_dictionary_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), with which they share a namespace.

In addition, the names of all repository objects should clearly identify the package or component they belong to. Technically speaking, a package does not generate its own namespace and therefore naming requires strict discipline. Using prefix namespaces is very helpful in itself. However, they are not intended for the package level but for bigger development projects, which usually comprise numerous packages.

Therefore, the names of the repository objects contained in a package should be labeled with a shared name component, which indicates the affiliation to a package or at least to an application component. The length of names is restricted to 30 characters or less, and the namespace prefix is included. Therefore, an abbreviation should be used for this name component and not the complete package name.

A global name should never be given for a package-specific or component-specific repository object. This would render the name useless for further general use. For example, general names of the SAP namespace (such as CHAR60 for a data element or CL\_ABAP\_MATH for a class) should only be declared in absolutely fundamental basis packages delivered by SAP and exposed by these packages in a generally available interface.

If developers find a repository object with a global name, they naturally assume that they can freely use the object in the way indicated by the name. Since the application of package boundaries is not checked thoroughly, repository objects with overly global names (particularly in the SAP namespace and also in the customer namespace) are now used throughout all AS ABAP packages. This can cause considerable difficulties when implementing real package encapsulation.

Note

The above rule supplements the global rule regarding [descriptive names](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentelling_names_guidl.htm "Guideline"). With regard to technical information in repository object names, the same information stated in section on descriptive names also applies here (also refer to the discussion on prefixes and suffixes in [program-internal names](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenprog_intern_names_guidl.htm "Guideline")).

All development organizations are free to create own naming conventions on the basis of the above rule regarding [descriptive names](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentelling_names_guidl.htm "Guideline"). However, note that the use of a namespace prefix only leaves limited space for the remaining name components. For example, the names of database tables are restricted to 16 characters. Therefore, the namespace prefix should not be too long. It should simply describe a product line using an abbreviation

Exception

Not all repository objects can be created in prefix namespaces. Some examples are authorization objects and type groups. In these cases, an additional package should be created that includes all of these objects. The object names and package names should, if possible, contain a relevant, normal prefix instead of the real namespace prefix /.../.

A similar guideline applies if further development is performed in areas that are traditionally located in the SAP namespace or the customer namespace. Instead of using a real namespace prefix, this can be simulated by using uniform prefixes when new packages and development objects are created.

If ABAP Workbench itself allocates [names](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensource_code_orga_guidl.htm "Guideline"), for instance, for include programs, which are assigned to specific master programs (such as function groups or class pools), this name allocation always has priority over all other rules. This ensures that the workbench and the compiler run correctly.

Example

Refer to the repository objects of the example application in the package SABAP\_DEMOS\_CAR\_RENTAL.

The subpackages of the SABAP\_DEMOS\_CAR\_RENTAL package start with the same name as the superpackage (as [recommended](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentelling_names_guidl.htm "Guideline") in these guidelines). A suffix indicates their specialization. The same applies to the package interfaces. Instead of a real namespace prefix, the repository objects of the packages have the DEMO\_ prefix. This indicates that the objects are part of a demo package. The affiliation with the car rental application is indicated by the abbreviation CR (car rental).

Program-Internal Names

Background

Program-internal names describe entities that are declared in the program and are called within the program or called by other programs. Typical examples include identifiers for data types and data objects as well as methods and method interface parameters.

Program-internal declarations can be configured in different contexts that all span a separate namespace. These contexts are arranged in the order from local to global:

1.  Local declarations in a procedure ([Method](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenfunct_module_subroutine_guidl.htm "Guideline"))
2.  Declarations of instance components and static components in a class
3.  Global declarations in the declaration part of a program

Here local declarations always obscure the more global declarations of higher contexts. Different types of declarations each span a separate namespace in their context, except the class components, which are all located in one single namespace, regardless of their type.

The identifiers used in ABAP programs are must comply with the syntactic requirements for classes (in accordance with the rule [Use ABAP Objects](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenabap_obj_progr_model_guidl.htm "Guideline") and the rule [Applying Default Settings to Program Attributes](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenprogram_attribute_guidl.htm "Guideline")). In other words, the identifiers must begin with a letter, which is followed other letters and numbers that can be separated by underscores.

Rule

Prevent program-internal names from being confused or obscured

Choose program-internal names that cannot be confused with ABAP words or other declarations. In addition, a local name must not obscure a more global name. Global entities and interface parameters of procedures should have a prefix for identification purposes.

Details

Besides using the general rule of assigning [meaningful names](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentelling_names_guidl.htm "Guideline"), it is also important for program-internal declarations that you stick to the above rule of eliminating human error (avoiding name confusion). Unlike a human reader, the compiler usually knows exactly what an identifier is referring to. Use the following prefixes to avoid the danger of unwanted obscuring and name confusion:

-   g\_ for global data objects

-   l\_ for local data objects that obscure static attributes

-   i\_ for IMPORTING parameters

-   e\_ for EXPORTING parameters

-   c\_ for CHANGING parameters

-   r\_ for RETURNING parameters

You can also use compound identifiers and component selectors.

The following sections discuss the different aspects of program-internal names in detail and with a systematic approach.

Confusion with ABAP Words

A basic rule in almost all naming specifications is that language statements must not be used as names in the source code (assuming that this is permitted by the syntax). The aim of this measure is to improve readability by preventing confusion between statements and names. In ABAP, however, it is difficult to strictly adhere to this rule, because the vocabulary of the programming language is very extensive and is continuously growing. In most cases, developers will not have memorized all the ABAP words that occur in all the statements and statement additions. Also, they cannot possibly know which words will be added in future.

For this reason, it is not logical or feasible to completely prohibit the use of ABAP words (ABAP keywords or additions) as names. Thanks to the color highlighting in ABAP Editor and the different capitalization rules in operands and ABAP words ([Pretty Printer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenuse_pretty_printer_guidl.htm "Guideline")), there is no risk of confusion. If in doubt, you can always use the (!) character directly in front of a name, to distinguish it from an ABAP word with the same name in a statement.

A single ABAP word, however, usually does not represent a descriptive name. Therefore, we recommend that you only use ABAP words as part of combined names with underscores (\_), for instance, account\_class instead of class. Because the underscore is not used in most ABAP words, it is usually a good idea to distinguish between ABAP words and [names](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentelling_names_guidl.htm "Guideline"). In some very rare cases, the compiler cannot distinguish an ABAP word from a name that is identical to the word. In these cases, the escape character (!) must be specified.

Confusion between different declarations

In classes, all components are in the same namespace. Therefore, it is not possible to have data types and attributes with the same name within a class to avoid confusion. In the other contexts, that is, within procedures ([Methods](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenfunct_module_subroutine_guidl.htm "Guideline")), or for global declarations of an ABAP program, different declarations generate different namespaces. Here it is possible to have data objects and data types with the same name. Object types (local classes and interfaces) are in the same namespace as data types.

To avoid confusion, we recommend that you use different names for different entities, and that you do not use the same names for data types and data objects. Exceptions to this rule are cases where the meaning of a name is absolutely clear, for example, the declaration of a helper variable:

DATA i TYPE i.

However, it should never be the case that a data object has the name of a data type that is not the type of the object:

DATA i     TYPE f.
DATA tadir TYPE trdir.

This is both confusing and dangerous!

Obscuring of More Global Declarations

The names in local contexts obscure declarations with the same name in contexts that are more global. In a method, for example, a data type declared with TYPES obscures an identically named data type of the class. This data type then obscures the identically named data type of the program, which in turn obscures an identically named data type from ABAP Dictionary.

Developers must ensure that a more global object (that should be used in the current context) is not obscured. Conversely, a global object must not be accidentally used instead of a local object. The reader of the source code should always know what a name refers to. This means that, when names are given, local names should not obscure any names that are more global.

Following the [KISS principle](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenkiss_principle_guidl.htm "Guideline"), it is recommended that local names are different from global names, because they do not follow their conventions. This mainly refers to the names in global declarations of the current program or in the repository. For example, a local class should never start with the cl\_ prefix, a local interface should never start with if\_ prefix, and a local data object should never start with the g\_ prefix.

-   Within methods

In a method (in new function modules and subroutines, there should be [no local declarations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenfunct_module_subroutine_guidl.htm "Guideline")), there is the danger that local names (including method parameters) can be confused with more global names. Declarations within the implementation can also be confused with method parameters. It should also be noted that methods in the same class always obscure any built-in functions with the same name.

To prevent local data objects in a method from being confused with components of their own class, you can explicitly address class components using the name of the class and the class component selector (=>), or using the object reference variable me and the instance component selector (->) .

If there is a danger that identically named built-in functions can be confused, the functional methods of the same class should be addressed only by using one of the selectors when using functional method calls. However, excessive use of selectors can make the source code difficult to read. Therefore, each case should be assessed separately. This danger of confusion is only relevant for short method names, however. For methods with names consisting of multiple words or names that start with the prefixes set\_, get\_, or is\_, there is usually no risk of confusion. Methods should always have a [manageable size](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenproc_volume_guidl.htm "Guideline"), and all declarations are therefore always visible for the reader. Therefore, this simple rule should be sufficient to make the method easy to read.

If the declaration of the method’s parameter interface is not visible in the method implementation (as in local classes), it is useful to make an additional distinction between local data and the method parameters. It has become customary to use the prefixes mentioned earlier to achieve this. An alternative prefix component l could also be considered here for local data, but it ultimately represents redundant information.

-   Within classes

If you use class components, you can always avoid confusion by addressing the class components using the name of the class and the class component selector (\=>) or an object reference variable and the instance component selector (\->). The implementation of a corresponding naming convention would lead to redundant information, which would not improve readability and would be contradictory to the basic [KISS principle](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenkiss_principle_guidl.htm "Guideline"). This applies in particular to the methods of the class. Although these methods obscure any identically named built-in functions, it would be very unusual to implement a prefix that indicates a method as a method of a class. Instead, methods should not be given the names of built-in functions.

-   In programs (general)

In the global declaration part of a program, you can create local classes and interfaces, as well as global data types and data objects.

-   The names of local classes and interfaces do not follow the naming conventions for global classes and interfaces. In other words, they cannot start with cl\_ or if\_, to ensure that no global declarations are obscured. With respect to local data, you can consider the naming convention lcl\_ or lif\_, but this would be redundant and not necessarily required, because a class/interface without a prefix is always known as a local class/local interface. The use of lif\_ may be useful for distinguishing a local interface from a local class.

-   Data types should no longer occur in the [global declaration part](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendeclaration_variables_guidl.htm "Guideline") of a program. Global data objects are only required for communication between ABAP and dynpro if [classic dynpros](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenencap_class_interf_guidl.htm "Guideline") are used. Since these objects cannot names cannot be prefixed with a program name, as with class attributes (absolute names are only possible for data types and only in dynamic specifications), you must use the g\_ prefix for global data objects, to prevent confusion with local data objects or class attributes in method implementations. Global data objects can only exist in executable programs, module pools, and function groups. Global classes and interfaces cannot contain any global data objects. Therefore, a g\_ prefix for class components or interface components is definitely the wrong choice.

Note

Naming conventions are frequently established for names within the source code that define specifications for naming, including potential prefixes and suffixes. These specifications often get bogged down in excessive formal strictness. Names created this way contain redundant information, are difficult to maintain and often do not achieve the main aim of readability and self-documenting sources. Therefore, we limited our discussion to the naming-related aspects that we consider essential and universal. Further specifications are only useful at the level of development groups/organizations.

If prefixes and/or suffixes are used, it is common practice to store the technical attributes of the described object in these prefixes/suffixes. Apart from the fact that we do not consider it necessary to specify technical information in names, there are so many technical attributes of an object in ABAP that they cannot be mapped using simple rules for short prefixes/suffixes. Or combinations of different technical additions often cannot be interpreted uniquely. Some examples:

-   With respect to the data type of a data object, there are naming conventions where "v" and "c" as prefixes stand for "variable" or "constant" elementary data objects. Similarly, "s" and "t" as prefixes stand for "structures" and internal "tables". The type attribute "elementary" is wrongly equated with "variable" or "constant". If the attributes "static variable" and "sorted table" are also supposed to be expressed using "s", this is very likely to cause mistakes with name assignments. This makes it much harder to achieve the goal of readable, self-documenting source codes.

-   With respect to the validity area or the context of a data object, the naming conventions often stipulate the prefixes g\_ and l\_ for the names of global and local data objects. We identified g\_ for global data objects as the only convention that is actually required for program-internal names. However, the simultaneously labeling of all non-global objects with the prefix l\_ for the local validity area is almost never necessary. l\_ should only be used if a local name is to be the same as a more global name and the corresponding lack of obscuring component selectors would produce unreadable source code. The latter case only occurs for long class names in front of \=>. If me-> is used in front of the names of instance attributes, the method does not become any less unreadable than when an l\_ is placed in front of the name of a local data object.

It would actually be completely misleading to label static attributes of classes as global, using the prefix g\_. These attributes are only valid within the class and have completely different semantics than global data objects. The use of these attributes does not indicate a design weakness as it is generally the case for global data objects today.

-   With respect to the method parameters, we identified the prefixes i\_, e\_, c\_, and r\_ for importing, exporting, changing, and returning parameters as possible characteristics for distinguishing from data objects declared in the method. Apart from this, no further technical information needs to be expressed with additional prefixes. With method parameters in particular, technical information in prefixes tends to cause confusion rather than improve readability. For example, a prefix is\_ for "importing structure" would conflict with the prefix is\_ for "truth values", and a prefix it\_ for "importing table" could easily be understood as a general abbreviation of "internal table". If the role the parameter plays cannot be known from the descriptive name of a parameter and the procedure name, the names assigned are completely wrong and/or the procedure does not fulfill any clearly defined tasks. This type of conceptual weakness cannot be fixed (even with technical prefixes).

In summary, we recommend that you should use name additions cautiously, particularly additions with technical information. Of course, every organization is free to use these conventions, which can supplement our basic rules. In the ABAP environment - with its high versatility of types, many contexts, the distinction between pass by reference and pass by value - it is probably not an easy task to create a complete, self-contained, consistent, technically correct, and — above all — easy-to-understand set of rules for prefixes and suffixes. The known results are just pure conventions that are usually incomplete and are not always applicable.

Bad Example

The example shown below demonstrates how to obscure names in different contexts. The fact that no descriptive names were used for the data objects (for the sake of simplicity) can be disregarded here.

DATA a1 TYPE string VALUE \`a1 global\`.
DATA a2 TYPE string VALUE \`a2 global\`.
DATA a3 TYPE string VALUE \`a3 global\`.
DATA a4 TYPE string VALUE \`a4 global\`.
DATA a5 TYPE string VALUE \`a5 global\`.

CLASS demo DEFINITION.
  PUBLIC SECTION.
    METHODS main
      IMPORTING a1 TYPE string DEFAULT 'a1 imported'
      RETURNING value(a6) TYPE string.
    CLASS-DATA a1  TYPE string VALUE \`a1 class\`.
    CLASS-DATA a2  TYPE string VALUE \`a2 class\`.
    DATA a3        TYPE string VALUE \`a3 class\`.
    DATA a4        TYPE string VALUE \`a4 class\`.
ENDCLASS.

CLASS demo IMPLEMENTATION.
  METHOD main.
    DATA a3 TYPE string VALUE \`a3 local\`.
    DATA a4 TYPE string VALUE \`a4 local\`.
    CONCATENATE a1 demo=>a2 me->a3 a4 a5
      INTO a6 SEPARATED BY \`, \`.
  ENDMETHOD.
ENDCLASS.

If you just consider the implementation of the main method in the CONCATENATE statement, it is clearly evident only for the demo=>a2 and me->a3 operands that they are attributes of the class and that a4 is a local data object of the method. It is only possible in the general overview to see that a1 describes an importing parameter, a5 describes a global data object of the program, and a6 describes a returning parameter. The global data objects a1 to a4 cannot be addressed in the method because they are obscured by local data objects or attributes of the class.

Good Example

Unlike the source code above, the following source code includes the previously discussed prefixes, to prevent obscuring and to distinguish method parameters from local data objects. Again, descriptive names were not used here to focus on aspects that are essential for this example.

DATA g\_a1 TYPE string VALUE \`g\_a1 global\`.
DATA g\_a2 TYPE string VALUE \`g\_a2 global\`.
DATA g\_a3 TYPE string VALUE \`g\_a3 global\`.
DATA g\_a4 TYPE string VALUE \`g\_a4 global\`.
DATA g\_a5 TYPE string VALUE \`g\_a5 global\`.

CLASS demo DEFINITION.
  PUBLIC SECTION.
    METHODS main
      IMPORTING i\_a1 TYPE string DEFAULT 'i\_a1 imported'
      RETURNING value(r\_a6) TYPE string.
    CLASS-DATA a1  TYPE string VALUE \`a1 class\`.
    CLASS-DATA a2  TYPE string VALUE \`a2 class\`.
    DATA a3        TYPE string VALUE \`a3 class\`.
    DATA a4        TYPE string VALUE \`a4 class\`.
ENDCLASS.

CLASS demo IMPLEMENTATION.
  METHOD main.
    DATA a3 TYPE string VALUE \`a3 local\`.
    DATA a4 TYPE string VALUE \`a4 local\`.
    CONCATENATE i\_a1 demo=>a2 me->a3 a4 g\_a5
     INTO r\_a6 SEPARATED BY \`, \`.
  ENDMETHOD.
ENDCLASS.

All operands are now clearly known in the CONCATENATE statement. A prefix (l\_) can be implemented for the local names, but this is unnecessary for two reasons:

-   The declaration is defined near the place of usage and is always visible to the reader.

-   If you consistently use the selectors \-> and \=> to address the attributes of a class, all names without a prefix and with no specified class or a reference variable are known as local data objects.

By applying the minimal naming convention used here, you can address all data objects that are declared in the displayed source code section in the method. Of course, the declaration of the global data objects is only implemented to demonstrate obscuring and how to prevent it. Global data objects should [no longer be used](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendeclaration_variables_guidl.htm "Guideline") in programs that do not work with classic dynpros.

Names of Structure Components

Background

When ABAP programs are executed, the names of data objects usually only have the task of identifying the data objects uniquely. The ABAP statements operate directly with the objects in question without attaching any special meaning to their names. The names of structure components are an exception here. They are evaluated in the following cases:

-   When structure components are assigned using

-   the statement [MOVE-CORRESPONDING](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapmove-corresponding.htm)

-   the component operator [CORRESPONDING](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenconstructor_expr_corresponding.htm)

-   the system class [CL\_ABAP\_CORRESPONDING](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencl_abap_corresponding.htm)

-   In Open SQL, in the addition [CORRESPONDING](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapinto_clause.htm) of the statement [SELECT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapselect.htm)

-   In [obsolete calculation statements](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencomputing_obsolete.htm) like [ADD-CORRESPONDING](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapadd-corresponding.htm)

In these language constructs, the names of the components of the structures in question are compared and the operation is executed using the identically named components (if not overridden by a mapping rule).

Rule

Give structure components with the same meaning the same names

Give the components of structures that have the same meaning within a data model the same names

Details

This rule mainly applies to data models defined in ABAP Dictionary (including ABAP CDS). If one of the CORRESPONDING constructs above is used in an ABAP program to access structures or structured internal tables (and the structured types of these structures or tables are defined like database tables or CDS entities using types from the data model in ABAP Dictionary), it is essential that components from different structures but with the same semantics have the same name.

Bad Example

The database tables DOKIL DOKHL, and DOKTL are in the same package and the same application. The column whose type is determined by the data element DOKVERS has the same name (DOKVERSION) in DOKHL and DOKTL, but the name in DOKIL is VERSION.

Good Example

Columns of the familiar structures used in the flight data model in training and documentation that have the same semantics usually also have the same names.

Comments

Comments do not influence how a program is executed and are ignored by the computer. People who work with the source code, however, benefit greatly from comments, since they make the code easier to understand.

There are two categories of comments in ABAP:

-   Comment Lines

A comment line contains a comment and nothing else. It can be defined either by the \* character at the start of the program line, or by the " character at any point of a program line blank to its left.

-   End of line comments

An end of line comment is a comment added using the " character and located on the right of an ABAP statement or part of an ABAP statement.

A comment line or end of line comment can have any content and this content is ignored when the program is generated using ABAP Compiler.

Choosing the Language

Background

The natural language that has established itself worldwide for computer programming is English. This is because the language elements in all significant programming languages have been taken from English and their syntax based on English grammar. ABAP is no exception. In fact, efforts have been made to guarantee correct English by giving additions of related statements different names, even if they have the same meaning. Well-known examples include the (now obsolete) additions VARYING and VARY of the statements DO and WHILE. Here, ABAP can even be viewed as a subset of the English language.

Rule

Write program comments in English

Write all comments in ABAP programs in English only, so that as many readers as possible can understand them and benefit from them.

Details

English comments are a basic prerequisite for distributed development at an international level. There are other good reasons for using English as the comment language:

-   If names are in [English](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenchoice_langu_guidl.htm "Guideline"), the statements of an ABAP program can be considered (with a little good will) to be English sentences. For the reader, English comments are best suited for the source code. If comments in another language were used, this would result in a continuous switching between the languages, which would be exhausting even for readers who can speak the languages used.

-   Frequently, the unwanted [retelling comments](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencontent_guidl.htm "Guideline") are very similar to the described ABAP statements if they are written in English. This way, the author quickly realizes that his comment is superfluous.

Exception

Technical terms that originate from country-specific legislation (such as "Abgeltungssteuer" in German) or specific abbreviations (such as DÜVO) cannot be translated meaningfully or would no longer be recognizable after translation. Such terms should be placed in quotation marks and not be translated into English. In this case, it should be noted that [country-specific characters](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencharacter_set_guidl.htm "Guideline") can be replaced with 7-bit ASCII characters. The goal of the above rule is to enable as many users a possible to follow the program flow. This is still possible if non-IT terms are worded in another language.

Note

This rule applies regardless of the [original language](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenoriginal_langu_guidl.htm "Guideline") chosen.

Bad Example

The following source code shows a typical example of German comments, mixed with English terms, which usually do not even follow the required notation or terminology.

"Horizontales Splittercontrol im Hilfecontainer
CREATE OBJECT splitter\_h
  EXPORTING
    parent = help\_container
    rows = 1
    columns = 2.

"Vertikales Splittercontrol im linken Container
CREATE OBJECT splitter\_v
  EXPORTING
    parent = container\_left
    rows = 2
    columns = 1.

Good Example

The following source code shows the above source code with English comments, as set out in the above rule.

  "Horizontal splitter control in help container
CREATE OBJECT splitter\_h
  EXPORTING
    parent = help\_container
    rows = 1
    columns = 2.

  "Vertical splitter control in left container
CREATE OBJECT splitter\_v
  EXPORTING
    parent = container\_left
    rows = 2
    columns = 1.

The goal of this example is to show the difference between German and English comments. If more meaningful [names](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentelling_names_guidl.htm "Guideline") had been chosen, that is splitter\_horizontal instead of splitter\_h, and so on, comments could be dispensed with altogether, thus complying with the following [rule](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencontent_guidl.htm "Guideline").

Content

Background

It is usually sufficient to examine the ABAP statements to find out what happens in an implementation. However, it much more difficult to find out why something happens. This is often only possible in a much wider context and requires a great deal of effort.

Rule

Make meaningful comments

Write comments for your implementations that describe why something is done and not how.

Details

The best case scenario is where meaningful [identifiers](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abennaming_guidl.htm "Guideline") are used in the source code; the source code effectively documents itself. This is the best way to document the concept of "what happens in this program section". In this case, any additional comments that only describe obvious behavior are superfluous and do not make the code easier to understand. There is also the risk that when changes are made to the program logic, the associated comments are not adapted and are therefore no longer correct. In summary, these comments are not only useless but can even be misleading and should be avoided from the start.

Conversely, developers often tend to assume that their source code is sufficiently self-documenting and leave out descriptive comments. However, this assumption is often incorrect. This becomes apparent when a third party tries to understand the source code (either when attempting to enhance the source code or identify a problem). Even the authors of the code can often face this problem, if they are confronted with source code that they wrote a long time ago and have not seen the source code since.

Even if the identifier names allow readers to easily follow what happens in the code, the question "why" often remains unanswered. Therefore, this information must be provided as comments in the source code. This also includes a description of the algorithms used or at least a list of their names.

Note

This section mainly deals with commenting the implementation of functions.. Header comments play a different role. Such comments, usually in the form of line comments that start with an asterisk (\*), subdivide large source codes into meaningful sections and can contain administrative entries. Here the rule also applies that these comments should not repeat what is already clearly described in the source code or described by any other means. For example, the person who last changed the program or the change date is indicated in the program attributes. A header comment with the name of a class or method directly above the class or method is also redundant information. However, it makes more sense to differentiate between logical program parts, which cannot be indicated in the code. For example, you can subdivide the program into a global declaration part and an implementation part. Usually, this is only required if the program is not subdivided by [include programs](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensource_code_modular_guidl.htm "Guideline").

Bad Example

The meaning of the comments in the following source code is actually already perfectly obvious due to the commented statements.

"Select udat, stime from trdir
"into change\_date, change\_time
SELECT SINGLE udat, stime
       FROM trdir
       WHERE name = @prog\_name
       INTO (@change\_date, @change\_time).

"Set version\_date, version\_time to change\_date, change\_time
IF sy-subrc = 0.
   IF change\_date > version\_date.
      version\_date = change\_date.
      version\_time = change\_time.
   ELSEIF change\_date = version\_date AND
          change\_time > version\_time.
   version\_time = change\_time.
  ENDIF.
ENDIF.

Good Example

In the following source code, the comments in the above example have been replaced with a description of why something happens.

"If a newer program exists, version time stamp must
"be adjusted to program time stamp
SELECT SINGLE udat, stime
       FROM trdir
       WHERE name = @prog\_name
       INTO (@change\_date, @change\_time).

IF sy-subrc = 0.
   IF change\_date > version\_date.
      version\_date = change\_date.
      version\_time = change\_time.
   ELSEIF change\_date = version\_date AND
          change\_time > version\_time.
   version\_time = change\_time.
  ENDIF.
ENDIF.

Arrangement in the Source Code

Background

The arrangement of comments plays an important role (in addition to comment language and comment content) in making programs easy to read.

Rule

Arrange comments correctly

Place comments in front of the statements that they describe. The horizontal arrangement of comments should follow the indentations of the source code. End of line comments should only be placed after declarative or concluding statements.

Details

Vertical positioning
In general, when users read source code, they prefer to view the comment first and then the described statements. This arrangement means that the correlation between the comment and the associated source code passage is intuitively clear.

For control structures, this means that comment lines directly before a control statement (such as IF or WHILE) refer to the associated condition and comment lines after the control statement refer to the associated statement block. Comment lines directly before an ELSE or WHEN OTHERS statement have obviously been put in the wrong place.

End of line comments
End of line comments are problematic in conjunction with executable statements. Individual executable program lines are usually not complex enough to justify a separate comment for each one. If you add end of line comments, they will often be [unwanted](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencontent_guidl.htm "Guideline") repetitions of what the statements clearly indicate already. In addition, these comments tend to be cryptic and unclear, because the ends of lines does not provide enough space for meaningful comments in most cases. A uniform alignment for end of line comments can only be achieved with a high degree of effort.

Therefore, you should make comments for entire statement blocks. Use self-contained comment lines to do this. This is because it is difficult to describe a reference to more than one statement line if you use end of line comments.

End of line comments are suitable for the following situations:

-   To comment on declarative statements

-   To indicate block ends (separate from indentations) in larger control structures

-   To justify pseudo comments (at the relevant places) for hiding messages from the extended program check or [Code Inspector](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencode_inspector_guidl.htm "Guideline").

The pseudo comments for hiding warnings of the extended program check and [Code Inspector](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencode_inspector_guidl.htm "Guideline") play a special role. They are not comments in the usual sense of the word. They are program directives that must be appear in the same lines as the commented statements to take full effect. These pseudo comments were replaced by pragmas for the extended program check.

Indentations
Formatting source code using indentations is essential. Otherwise the human reader cannot understand the logical structure. This formatting is required by the rule for using the [pretty printer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenuse_pretty_printer_guidl.htm "Guideline"). However, if comments are added in the source code that do not follow this formatting, they hide the logical structure and make the code difficult to read. Therefore, comment lines must have the same indentation as the statement lines that they relate to.

These indentations can only be achieved using comments that start with a quotation mark ("), because this character can be in any position. A comment line that starts with an asterisk (\*) must always be in the first position. It is therefore strongly recommended that you start all comments used in procedures ([methods](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenuse_operand_position_guidl.htm "Guideline")) with a quotation mark and the correct indentation. Comment lines that start with a quotation mark must not be confused with end of line comments, which are appear after different code.

Comment lines that start with an asterisk should only be used for head comments of classes and procedures. Here they help to [subdivide](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencontent_guidl.htm "Guideline") source code into logical sections. In addition, they are useful for temporarily disabling statements by commenting them out. The commented-out code can be clearly distinguished from actually indented comments.

Bad Example

The following source code shows the implementation part of a class. The positioning of the comments does not follow the above rule.

CLASS application IMPLEMENTATION. "Application class
  METHOD main. "Main Method

\* Item data
  DATA items  TYPE STANDARD TABLE
              OF REF TO item.
DATA item\_ref LIKE LINE OF items.

\* Amount data
  DATA amount TYPE i.
  DATA total\_amount TYPE i.
  ...

\* Loop over all items to compute total amount
    LOOP AT items INTO item\_ref. "Loop over all items
      IF item\_ref IS BOUND AND
         item\_ref->is\_valid( ) = abap\_true. "Check validity
         amount = item\_ref->get\_amount( ). "Get amount
         ADD amount TO total\_amount. "Add amount to totals
          ...                                          "...
       ELSE.
          ...
      ENDIF.
    ENDLOOP.
    ...
  ENDMETHOD.
ENDCLASS.

Good Example

The following source code shows the same implementation part as above. However, the comments are positioned as recommended. Comment lines that start with an asterisk (\*) are used as header comments in the program structure. End of line comments only appear after declarations and block ends. All other comments appear in comment lines before the described statements and are indented accordingly.

\*----------------------------------------------------------\*
\* Class implementations

Global Declarations of a Program

Background

Each ABAP program has a global declaration part where data types, interfaces, classes, and data objects that are visible throughout the program can be declared.

From a technical viewpoint, the global declaration part consists of all declarations that cannot be assigned to a more local context (class, procedure). All declarations implemented in processing blocks without their own contexts (in event blocks and dialog modules) and declarations declared between completed processing blocks are assigned to the global context. Event blocks of GET and AT SELECTION-SCREEN events are exceptions. Variables declared here are only valid in the event block.

In an ABAP statement, it is only ever possible to refer to the previous declarations of the currently visible contexts.

Rule

Implement global declarations centrally

Place the global declaration part of a program at a central, context-related point at the beginning of the program.

Details

The global declaration part should only ever be the area between the introductory statement of an ABAP program and the first implementation. This the only place where global declarations should be made in a meaningful order. This ensures that the declarations intended for global use can really be used in all subsequent implementations.

There should not be any declarative statements in contexts that do not support local data (provided that they are [still used](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenabap_obj_progr_model_guidl.htm "Guideline")). Otherwise, a false impression of local validity is created when the program is read, which may lead to the program not being correctly understood.

This rule is only of explicit relevance when working with program types other than class or interface pools. Class Builder implicitly specifies which declarations occur and where. These are the declarations of the global class/global interface itself as well as optional local data types, classes, and interfaces in [class pools](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenlocal_type_glob_class_guidl.htm "Guideline"). The developer cannot directly access the master program of a class pool or interface pool. This is still the case even if the source-code-based Class Builder is introduced, because it only shows the declaration and implementation of the global class.

For other [program types](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenprogram_type_guidl.htm "Guideline") (subroutine pools, function groups, and executable programs), the developer can access the entire master program. If these program types are used, adherence to the rule is the developer's responsibility. The top include is helpful here. It is especially suited to all programs that are [organized](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensource_code_orga_guidl.htm "Guideline") using include programs. The [top include](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentop_include_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is specially designed for the global declaration part and is therefore supported by ABAP Workbench and ABAP Compiler. ABAP Workbench creates and includes the top include automatically. The compiler incorporates the relevant top include into the syntax check for an individual include program. This enables meaningful syntax checks to be made on individual include programs.

If the top include is available, it should always be the first include program that a master program includes. The top include can also contain additional INCLUDE statements. The top include, and any include programs included in the top include, can only contain declarations and not implementations.

If [ABAP Objects](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenabap_obj_progr_model_guidl.htm "Guideline") are the main focus, the global declaration part or the top include should only contain declarations of local classes and interfaces, if the above rule is strictly adhered to. Data types should only be [declared](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendeclaration_dtypes_const_guidl.htm "Guideline") for classes and interfaces or in ABAP Dictionary. Global data objects are only required for communication with classical dynpros. Therefore they should only be used in the top include for function groups that encapsulate classic [dynpros](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenencap_class_interf_guidl.htm "Guideline").

Exception

The above rule can be mainly justified due to the visibility within the program and the validity of declarations. Strictly speaking therefore, it only applies to program types other than class pools. In class pools, the visibility outside of the class pool and the resulting [dependencies](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenlocal_type_glob_class_guidl.htm "Guideline") are also important.

A further exception applies in the following situation: the local classes of a program are relatively independent units and their implementations do not refer to the declarations of other local classes. In this case, their declaration and implementation parts can be specified one after the other to improve readability.

Bad Example

The following source code shows a function group for encapsulating a classic dynpro, after the include programs have been resolved. The two dialog modules contain data declarations that look like local declarations but have global validity. Static access to this type of data object is only possible below the declaration, which means the function module has no access to g\_input\_field, and the PBO module has no access to g\_ok\_code.

FUNCTION-POOL z\_screen.

DATA g\_start\_value TYPE c LENGTH 20.

FUNCTION z\_handle\_screen.
\*"------------------------------------------------------
\*"\*"Local Interface:
\*" IMPORTING
\*" REFERENCE(i\_start\_value) TYPE csequence OPTIONAL
\*"------------------------------------------------------
  g\_start\_value = i\_start\_value.
  CALL SCREEN 100.
ENDFUNCTION.

MODULE status\_0100 OUTPUT.
  DATA g\_input\_field TYPE c LENGTH 20.
  g\_input\_field = g\_start\_value.
ENDMODULE.

MODULE user\_command\_0100 INPUT.
  DATA g\_ok\_code TYPE sy-ucomm.
  CASE g\_ok\_code.
    WHEN '...'.
       ...
  ENDCASE.
ENDMODULE.

Good Example

The following source code shows the function group from the above example, after the global declarations have been moved to a coherent global declaration part that follows the introductory statement. The additional global data object g\_start\_value is no longer required, and g\_ok\_code can be accessed in the PBO module.

FUNCTION-POOL z\_screen.

DATA: g\_input\_field TYPE c LENGTH 20,
      g\_ok\_code TYPE sy-ucomm.

FUNCTION z\_handle\_screen.
\*"------------------------------------------------------
\*"\*"Local Interface:
\*" IMPORTING
\*" REFERENCE(i\_start\_value) TYPE csequence OPTIONAL
\*"------------------------------------------------------
  g\_input\_field = i\_start\_value.
  CALL SCREEN 100.
ENDFUNCTION.

MODULE status\_0100 OUTPUT.
  CLEAR g\_ok\_code.
ENDMODULE.

MODULE user\_command\_0100 INPUT.
  CASE g\_ok\_code.
    WHEN '...'.
      ...
  ENDCASE.
ENDMODULE.

Local Declarations

Background

Local declarations can be made in a procedure ( [method](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenfunct_module_subroutine_guidl.htm "Guideline")). These are data types, data objects, and field symbols that are valid in the context of the procedure only. Therefore, they can only be addressed in the code of the procedure and are only available during the execution of the procedure (the data objects declared with STATICS are an exception).

Procedure-local declarations can be specified in any position of a procedure. However, the position of the declaration does not influence the validity area of the declared object (which always comprises the entire procedure), but only the static visibility.

Rule

Implement local declarations at the beginning of the procedure

Position the local declarations of a procedure ( [method](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenfunct_module_subroutine_guidl.htm "Guideline") coherently and at the beginning of a procedure. The local declarations must not be distributed across the implementation of the procedure.

Details

Local declarations within a procedure ( [method](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenfunct_module_subroutine_guidl.htm "Guideline")) are statically visible starting from the point of the program where they are positioned to the end of the procedure. However, because they are valid in the entire procedure, the declared entities can be accessed dynamically throughout the entire procedure. The following program example illustrates the different behavior:

METHOD demo\_method.
  FIELD-SYMBOLS <field\_symbol> TYPE any.
  ...
\* ASSIGN dobj TO <field\_symbol>. "Syntax error ...
  ASSIGN ('DOBJ') TO <field\_symbol>. "No error
  ASSERT <field\_symbol> IS ASSIGNED.
  ...
  DATA dobj TYPE i.
ENDMETHOD.

Because the different behavior of the [dynamic](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendynamic_prog_technique_guidl.htm "Guideline") and the static variant of the ASSIGN statement is rather unexpected, all declarations are supposed to be carried out at the beginning of the procedure, that is, between the introductory and the first executable statement. Then, the static and the dynamic visibility sections match.

This rule contradicts the common recommendations for other programming languages. They recommend declaring local variables as close to their use as possible to tightly restrict their validity area. In ABAP, however, there is no block-local validity of local variables. Positioning a declaration within the statement block of a loop, for example, does not make it possible to restrict the validity of this declaration to this statement block. Rather, the variable is valid within the entire procedure. So a declaration at the position where it is used can be misleading to developers or readers of a program who are not aware of this.

According to the rule, [the size of a procedure](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenproc_volume_guidl.htm "Guideline") should be selected in such a way that the procedure remains clear for the reader, which means there is no good reason why all variables should not be declared as a whole at the beginning of a procedure.

Note

Within processing blocks that do not support any local data (dialog modules and event blocks), declarative statements must be [omitted completely](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenglobal_declar_guidl.htm "Guideline").

In [function modules and subroutines](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenfunct_module_subroutine_guidl.htm "Guideline"), there should be no local data, only a method call.

Exception

[Inline declarations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendeclaration_inline_guidl.htm "Guideline") in procedures generally represent an exception. If used correctly, they can make a program easier to understand.

Bad Example

The following source code shows a local data declaration in a loop. Readers who are familiar with another programming language or even the developer of the program himself would probably expect the number variable to be set to value 10 for each loop pass. Indeed, number is set to 10 exactly once when the method starts because the variable is created only once for the context of the method and provided with a start value.

METHOD main.
  ...
  DO 10 TIMES.
    DATA number TYPE i VALUE 10.
    ...
    "number = 11, 13, 16, 20, ...
    number = number + sy-index.
    ...
  ENDDO.
  ...
ENDMETHOD.

Good Example

The following source code shows the corrected version of the above example, which behaves as the above example is expected to behave (if deeper ABAP knowledge is not involved). There is no block-local validity of data in ABAP, so proceed as shown below.

METHOD main.
  DATA number TYPE i.
  ...
  DO 10 TIMES.
    number = 10.
    ...
    "number = 11, 12, 13, 14, ...
    number = number + sy-index.
    ...
  ENDDO.
  ...
ENDMETHOD.

Source Code Modularization

Background

The unit in the ABAP environment that corresponds to a source code file capable of being inserted into another program is known as an include program. Include programs are used for source code modularization and are inserted into master programs for this purpose. Include programs are not compilation units (which means they are not compilable on their own), but can be activated and transported separately. The [master programs](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenprogram_type_guidl.htm "Guideline") of include programs (such as class pools, interface pools, function groups, subroutine pools, or executable programs) are compilation units in which, when compiled, an INCLUDE statement is replaced by the content of the specified include program.

Rule

Use include programs to modularize source code.

Distribute the source code of large ABAP programs across several include programs, remembering to choose a granularity for the modules that suits the structure of the program's structure.

Details

A suitable level of source code modularization using include programs makes it easier to develop and modify larger programs in several ways:

-   The lock management of ABAP Editor works at the level of include programs. In this way, several developers can make changes to a large program at the same time, as long as the source code sections in question are in different include programs.

-   Include programs are activated separately. This means that corrections or new developments in a master program can be activated independently of each other, as long as they are in separate include programs.

-   Include programs can be transported separately. In this way, specific corrections can be distributed across a system landscape without the need to transport the entire master program. This minimizes the potential for conflicts between correction levels.

The development environment already provides modularization templates using includes for many master programs. For example, the visibility sections and methods of global classes or function modules of a function group are saved in separate include programs. The source code-based Class Builder displays the resolved include programs as a single programs, but saves each part separately. The top include for global declarations is also supported by ABAP Workbench and ABAP Compiler.

As well as this, you can perform manual modularization using include programs, if required. Here, you can perform some of the extra modularizations on the include programs defined by ABAP Workbench. Or you can create include programs for master programs that are not modularized automatically (such as subroutine pools and executable programs).

Include programs that you create manually must contain a logically related section of the source code and this section must represent an independently maintainable and transportable unit. Logically related units such as individual procedures ([methods](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenfunct_module_subroutine_guidl.htm "Guideline")) or the declaration parts of local classes should not be distributed across multiple include programs, however. (The declaration parts of global classes are distributed automatically across multiple include programs, as specified by ABAP Compiler. There is no reason why ABAP developers should distribute local classes in the same way.)

Include programs you create manually should be named in accordance with the naming conventions of ABAP Workbench for automatically generated include programs. These conventions emphasize the relationship between the include program and the master program and prevent include programs [from being used more than once](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenmultiple_use_include_guidl.htm "Guideline").

Multiple Use of Include Programs

Background

From a technical point of view, it is possible to use an include program multiple times by integrating it more than once into a master program or different master programs.

Rule

Do not use include programs more than once

Use an include program for the modularization of exactly one master program. It must not be integrated into multiple different master programs. Also, an include program should only be integrated once within a master program.

Details

The multiple use of include programs is highly problematic conceptually. This particularly concerns the use of include programs for the reuse of:

-   Type definitions

-   Data declarations

-   Local classes

-   Procedure implementations

We strongly recommended using only suitable means for reuse, such as global classes or interfaces, for the reasons specified in the following sections.

Restricted maintainability
The integration of an include program into multiple master programs dramatically restricts the maintainability both of the include program itself and of the master programs using it. Changes to an include program like this can be unproblematic in the context of selected master programs, but can make other master programs syntactically incorrect at the same time. This is particularly critical for master programs that integrate include programs that were developed in other systems.

Increased resource consumption
If master programs that use shared include programs are executed at the same time, these include programs must be loaded multiple times by the ABAP runtime environment, which increases memory consumption. In the past, include programs were used multiple times for the central definition of constants, for example. Today, you should use a global interface or global class for this purpose. Because it is loaded only once, the memory consumption does not increase with every new use as it does with any multiple use of include programs.

The memory consumption also increases if an include program is used multiple times within one master program (for example, through integration into the source code of multiple function modules of a function group or into the source code of multiple methods of a class) because this expands the master program unnecessarily. When using centrally defined, [standalone types](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenbound_independent_dtype_guidl.htm "Guideline") and storing required constants in suitable classes or interfaces, there remains no conceivable scenario where it would be useful to use include programs multiple times within a master program.

Missing semantic context
Like source code files in other programming environments, include programs are integrated into a master program as pure text and without any semantics. The semantics only emerge in the context of the master program and the position where the include program is integrated. Consequently, especially class definitions that are integrated into different master programs by using an include program result in different technical classes whose objects have different reference types and cannot be exchanged between the master programs.

Bad Example

The following source code shows an include program that contains declarations of constants intended for use in multiple programs. According to the above rule, procedures of this type are no longer permitted.

\*&---------------------------------------------\*
\*& Include Z\_ORDERS\_OF\_MAGNITUDE
\*&---------------------------------------------\*
CONSTANTS:
  mega TYPE  p DECIMALS 6 VALUE '1000000.0',
  kilo TYPE  p DECIMALS 6 VALUE '1000.0',
  milli TYPE p DECIMALS 6 VALUE '0.001',
  micro TYPE p DECIMALS 6 VALUE '0.000001'.

Good Example

The following source code shows the same declarations of constants as in the above example, but this time in a global class suitable for reuse. Here, a corresponding ABAP Unit test method would even be possible that checks the consistency of the constants.

CLASS zcl\_orders\_of\_magnitude DEFINITION PUBLIC .
  PUBLIC SECTION.
    CONSTANTS:
      mega TYPE  p DECIMALS 6 VALUE '1000000.0',
      kilo TYPE  p DECIMALS 6 VALUE '1000.0',
      milli TYPE p DECIMALS 6 VALUE '0.001',
      micro TYPE p DECIMALS 6 VALUE '0.000001'.
ENDCLASS.

Alternative Language Constructs

Background

Alternative language constructs are parts of statements that can be written in different ways. One reason for this are the constant new developments in the language. Often, new spellings are introduced and the old spellings retained for reasons of downward-compatibility.

Rule

Use consistent spelling

If there is more than one spelling for a statement, choose one of these spellings and use it consistently throughout your development work It is best to choose the spelling that most accurately reflects the semantics of the statement.

Details

To make your programming easier to understand, always choose the spelling that is most accurate and easiest to read, and which (where applicable) matches the spelling used in other statements. The following list contains some examples:

-   If you can choose from a range of relational operators (\= or EQ, \> or GT, < or LT, \>= or GE, <= or LE) we recommend that you pick a type of operator and stick to it within the context of a program. The variant with the characters =, <, and > is seen as more modern, but also overloads these characters. The relational operators that consist of two letters are better matched to other relational operators such as CO, CN, and so on, which have no alternative forms.

-   The addition NOT of the [relational operators](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenrel_operator_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") BETWEEN, IN, IS ASSIGNED, IS BOUND, IS INSTANCE OF, IS INITIAL, and IS SUPPLIED is a better option than the identical Boolean operator NOT, for improved readability. For example, the expression a IS NOT INITIAL is easier than the logically identical expression NOT a IS INITIAL. This corresponds to the definition of comparison expressions, where a <> b is more intuitive than NOT a = b.

-   The addition LENGTH len of the declarative statements DATA and TYPES is preferable to the length specified in parentheses (len). This then matches the spelling used in CREATE DATA ... LENGTH. In addition to this, it is easy to mistake the parenthesized form for [dynamic tokens](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendynamic_prog_technique_guidl.htm "Guideline"). Only dynamic tokens should use this form.

-   The optional addition SUBSTRING of the statements FIND and REPLACE can be used to make a clearer distinction from the alternative addition REGEX.

-   In Open SQL, comma-separated lists are preferable to lists without commas. Using commas as separators is the prerequisite for using expressions in lists. [Host variables](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenhost_variable_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") should always be indicated by the escape character @.

-   Within the parameter list of the statements EXPORT and IMPORT, use the equals sign (=) instead of the additions FROM or TO. The spelling then matches the spelling used in parameter lists in other calls, such as methods, functions modules, and transformations.

-   Always use the semantically identical addition ACTUAL LENGTH instead of the addition LENGTH of the statement READ DATASET. This makes the distinction from the similar addition MAXIMUM LENGTH clearer. The last two examples are typical of the way new additions are added to the language, while retaining the old spelling (in a shortened form) for reasons of downward compatibility.

Bad Example

The following piece of source code shows how the statement FIND is used inconsistently within a program. The first and third FIND statements are alternative spellings with the same meaning.

DATA text TYPE string.
...
FIND '...' IN text.
...
FIND REGEX '...' IN text.
...
FIND SUBSTRING '...' IN text.
...

Good Example

The following piece of source code shows the same statements as in the example above, but with consistent spelling. This expresses the semantic distinction between searching for a substring and searching for a regular expression in clear syntax.

DATA text TYPE string.
...
FIND SUBSTRING '...' IN text.
...
FIND REGEX '...' IN text.
...
FIND SUBSTRING '...' IN text.
...

Chained Statements

Background

Successive ABAP statements that have the same starting part can be expressed in a chained statement. A chained statement consists of the identical starting part that is specified once and that is concluded by a colon (:). Behind this colon, the remaining parts are separated by commas (,). Only the last part is concluded with a period (.). During the syntax check and the compilation, a chained statement is handled like the respective sequence of individual ABAP statements, where the shared starting part is put in front of each remaining part. The identical starting parts are not restricted to the keyword.

Rule

Only use chained statements where appropriate

Use chained statements mainly for declarations. They should always be used for related declarations of type TYPES BEGIN OF ... TYPES END OF ....

Details

The main motivation for using chained statements is to increase the readability of programs. Using chained statements correctly in declarations achieves this goal. In other statements, chained statements can actually decrease the readability or, in the worst case, result in incorrect program behavior. When using chained statements, only [one statement at most should be specified per program line](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenstatement_guidl.htm "Guideline"). Never span [expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenexpression_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or functional calls across multiple parts of chained statements.

Declarations

In complex declarations, chained statements can be used to improve readability. (However, if local declarations are too complex, this suggests an [insufficient separation of tasks](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenproc_volume_guidl.htm "Guideline"), and should not occur.) In particular, multiple chained statements can be used to group related declarations:

DATA:
   airplane            TYPE REF TO cl\_airplane,
   airplane\_attributes TYPE cl\_airplane=>airplane\_attributes.
DATA:
   airport            TYPE REF TO cl\_airport,
   airport\_attributes TYPE cl\_airport=>airport\_attributes.
...

The grouping of declarative statements that semantically represent a composite statement is even more important. For example, the declaration of structured types and data objects in ABAP is done using individual statements, whose close relationship should be expressed by a chained statement:

TYPES:
   BEGIN OF file,
     name TYPE string,
     owner TYPE sy-uname,
     creation\_date TYPE timestamp,
   END OF file.

For structures that copy components of another structure using the statements INCLUDE TYPE or INCLUDE STRUCTURE, this procedure cannot be used consistently because the beginning of the statement is different and therefore the chained statement must be interrupted. In any case, we [no longer recommend](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenincluding_structures_guidl.htm "Guideline") using the statement INCLUDE.

Operational Statements

For operational statements, however, chained statements are not recommended because they do not usually result in better readability. Example:

CALL METHOD meth EXPORTING para = : '1', '2', '3'.

Here, the exploitation of the fact that the same starting parts in front of the colon are not limited to the keyword was a little overdone. The following chained statement would be easier to read:

CALL METHOD:
meth EXPORTING para = '1',
meth EXPORTING para = '2',
meth EXPORTING para = '3'.

However, in this case the best [notation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenmethod_call_guidl.htm "Guideline") can manage without a chained statement anyway:

meth( '1' ).
meth( '2' ).
meth( '3' ).

Unexpected Behavior

If chained statements are not understood correctly, this can easily produce statements with correct syntax but unexpected behavior. Prominent examples are introductory statements within control structures. Here, the use of chained statements does not usually lead to the intended result.

Let us look at the following TRY control structure, in which the CATCH statements are implemented using a chained statement:

TRY.
     ...
  CATCH: cx\_1, cx\_2, cx\_3.
     "exception handling
      ...
ENDTRY.

A reader and probably even a developer would assume that this is a CATCH block that handles three exceptions. In fact, the complete syntax is as follows:

TRY.
     ...
  CATCH cx\_1.
  CATCH cx\_2.
  CATCH cx\_3.
    "exception handling
     ...
ENDTRY.

The cx\_1 and cx\_2 exceptions are indeed caught, but the corresponding CATCH blocks are empty. Only the third exception cx\_3 has a CATCH block that is not empty. The syntax that the developer presumably intended is as follows:

TRY.
    ...
  CATCH cx\_1 cx\_2 cx\_3.
    "exception handling
    ...
ENDTRY.

For the WHEN blocks within a CASE control structure, the following applies:

WHEN: a, b, c.

is not equivalent to the more probable

WHEN a OR b OR c.

The [extended program check](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenextended_program_check_guidl.htm "Guideline") warns of empty statement blocks after CATCH and WHEN. In this way, the extended program check can be used to uncover where chained statements have been misused within TRY and CASE control structures.

Another example in which the use of chained statements can cause problems are Open SQL statements. Here are two examples:

-   The following chained statement consists of two SELECT statements that both supply a work area with values, and of which only the second one has a WHERE condition.

SELECT SINGLE carrid, connid
       FROM spfli
       WHERE @carrid = '...'
       INTO: @carrid\_wa, @connid\_wa.

The following INTO clause was undoubtedly meant here:

INTO (@carrid\_wa, @connid\_wa).

-   In the following example, the seemingly single statement does not update the discount and the telephone number of the customer with the customer ID 00017777. Instead, these are in fact two statements, of which the first changes the discount for all customers and the second changes the telephone number of the customer with the customer ID 00017777.

UPDATE scustom SET: discount = '003',
                    telephone = '0621/444444'
               WHERE id = '00017777'.

Even if the previous examples of the chained statements would show the semantic that is expected by the developer, such use is not recommended in any case because each reader would probably expect a different program behavior, and the readability and maintainability of the source code would be impaired considerably.

Expressions and Function Calls

Unfortunately, ABAP statements can be spanned across the colon in chained statements, even within expressions or function calls. The following example with correct syntax shows what can happen here, even in the simplest of cases. This example cannot be understood and nor does it produce the expected result.

DATA: itab TYPE TABLE OF i,
      num  TYPE i.
itab = VALUE #(: ( 1 ) ), ( 2 ) ), ( 3 ) ), ( 4 ) ).
num  = itab\[: 1 \], 2 \], 3 \], 4 \].
cl\_demo\_output=>new(
  )->write\_data(: \`Text1\` ), \`Text2\` ), num
  )->display( ).

Method Calls

Background

Static calls of methods can be formulated in two different ways. The [obsolete long form](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapcall_method_static.htm)

CALL METHOD meth EXPORTING ...

is based on the notation of the function module call. Alternatively, a [short form](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapcall_method_static_short.htm) can be used:

meth( ... ).

This form uses a parenthesis notation instead of the introductory ABAP words [CALL METHOD](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapcall_method_static.htm). A combination of CALL METHOD and parentheses is also possible.

Rule

Formulate static method calls without CALL METHOD

Use the long form of the method call using CALL METHOD only for dynamic method calls.

Details

The short form of the static method call is clearer. The redundant ABAP words CALL METHOD provide no additional information to the reader. Using the short form, self-contained method calls have the same appearance as functional method calls on operand positions. For dynamic method calls, the long form with CALL METHOD is required by the syntax. If it is only used there, the different notations provide the reader with another distinguishing feature between the static and dynamic method call.

Bad Example

The following source code shows the long form of a static method call using CALL METHOD, which is no longer recommended.

...
CALL METHOD cl\_class=>do\_something
  EXPORTING
    some\_input = value1
  IMPORTING
    some\_output = value2
  CHANGING
    some\_change = value3.
...

The following source code shows the same static method call as above, but with parentheses inserted. In this form, which also has correct syntax, either CALL METHOD or the parentheses are superfluous.

...
CALL METHOD cl\_class=>do\_something(
  EXPORTING
    some\_input = value1
  IMPORTING
    some\_output = value2
  CHANGING
    some\_change = value3 ).
...

Good Example

The following source code shows the same method call as above, but as recommended, without CALL METHOD. If a method has only importing parameters, IMPORTING and CHANGING can be omitted, and also the EXPORTING addition. If it is a single importing parameter, its name can also be omitted.

...
cl\_class=>do\_something(
  EXPORTING
    some\_input = value1
  IMPORTING
    some\_output = value2
  CHANGING
    some\_change = value3 ).
...

Assignments

Background

For explicit assignments in which the value of a source is assigned to a target, ABAP contains the general assignment operator [\=](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenequals_operator.htm) and the special casting operator [?=](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapmove_cast.htm). Statements with these operators

lhs =*|*?= rhs.

enable assignments of

-   data objects,

-   Return values/results of functional methods, predefined functions, or construction expressions, table expressions and

-   results of calculation expressions (arithmetic expressions, bit expressions, and string expressions)

to variables that can also be declared inline and to [writable expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenwritable_expression_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Alongside the assignment operators, two obsolete statements exist for historical reasons that can also perform assignments:

-   The statement

[MOVE source TO*|*?TO destination.](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapmove_obs.htm)

assigns a source source to a target destination. It covers some of the operators performed by the assignment operators [\=](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenequals_operator.htm) and [?=](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapmove_cast.htm).

-   The statement

[COMPUTE lhs =*|*?= rhs.](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapcompute.htm)

has the same semantics as lhs =*|*?= rhs. The keyword COMPUTE can be written in front of each assignment with the assignment operators [\=](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenequals_operator.htm) and [?=](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapmove_cast.htm) where the left side is not an inline declaration, but is ignored.

Rule

Assignments with the assignment operators \= and ?= only

Use the assignment operators instead of the statement MOVE. Do not use the keyword COMPUTE in front of assignments.

Details

Assignments with the assignment operators [\=](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenequals_operator.htm) and [?=](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapmove_cast.htm) implement the most global concept. The right side is a [general expression position](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abengeneral_expr_position_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and the left side is a [declaration position](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendeclaration_position_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") (except in down casts).

The statements MOVE and COMPUTE have the following drawbacks:

-   The statement MOVE cannot be used globally. The only sources allowed are data objects, function methods, and certain predefined functions whose arguments must be single data objects. The only targets allowed are variables; inline declarations are not possible. Any future enhancements to operand positions will not be applied to MOVE.

-   The keyword COMPUTE is both confusing and surplus to requirements. If an arithmetic expression or other calculation expression is on the right side, the keyword COMPUTE has the correct meaning, but is redundant. If a data object, a function method, a predefined functions, or a constructor expression is on the right side, the keyword COMPUTE has the wrong meaning, since a return value is assigned instead of an expression being calculated.

The statements MOVE and COMPUTE were created at a time when assignments were only made between individual data objects and calculations were exclusively arithmetic. Neither of these statements is appropriate in a modern, expression-oriented ABAP program that exploits all options on the left and right sides of an assignments.

Note

The optional addition EXACT of the statements [MOVE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapmove_obs.htm) and [COMPUTE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapcompute.htm), which produces lossless assignments and lossless calculations, has been replaced in full by the lossless operator [EXACT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenconstructor_expression_exact.htm).

Bad Example

The following source code shows a simple assignment using MOVE and the assignment of an arithmetic expression after COMPUTE.

DATA text1 TYPE string.
DATA text2 TYPE string.
...
MOVE text1 TO text2.
DATA result TYPE decfloat34.
DATA number1 TYPE i.
DATA number2 TYPE i.
...
COMPUTE result = number1 \* number2.

Good Example

The following source code shows the same example as above but without specifying the keywords MOVE and COMPUTE. This makes inline declarations possible on the left side.

DATA text1 TYPE string.
...
DATA(text2) = text1.
DATA number1 TYPE i.
DATA number2 TYPE i.
...
DATA(result) = CONV decfloat34( number1 \* number2 ).

Calculations

Background

In ABAP, the [arithmetic operators](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenarithmetic_operator_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in [arithmetic expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenarithmetic_expression_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") are used for numeric calculations. Alongside the operand format, the dedicated ABAP keywords ADD, SUBTRACT, MULTIPLY and DIVIDE are also used for the basic arithmetic operations.

Rule

Use the operator format

For calculations, use the operator format with the equals sign (=) instead of the ABAP keyword format.

Details

Calculations with the statements ADD, SUBTRACT, MULTIPLY, and DIVIDE are often more difficult to read than the corresponding operator format. Calculations other than the basic arithmetic operations cannot be expressed by ABAP keywords in any case.

Exception

The command format allows the use of [chained statements](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenchained_statements_guidl.htm "Guideline"), which can be useful in these special cases:

ADD increment TO: sum\_individual,
                  sum\_total.

If arithmetic operations are in the form a = a + 1, where the target variable and one of the operands are identical, using the statements ADD, SUBTRACT and so on has the advantage of being easier on the eye, especially when the name of the target variable is relatively long:

SUBTRACT 1 FROM reference->structured\_attribute-component.

It is immediately clear to the observer that the value of the specified variables is reduced by one. This may not be the case for the operator format, if it is not straightaway obvious that the target variable and one of the operands are identical. In such cases you can and should ignore the above rule. The primary concern is the readability of the source code.

Bad Example

The following source code shows a multiplication using the statement MULTIPLY.

MULTIPLY n1 by n2.

Good Example

The following source code shows the same example as above, but in the more compact operator format.

n1 = n1 \* n2.

Complexity

The aim of program complexity is to keep the source code as clear and readable as possible for the human reader. The computer has no problems with compiling or executing highly complex programs. Unformatted source code does also not constitute any problems. The human reader, however, is usually overwhelmed by the program complexity.

High complexity in this context means, for example, voluminous procedures ([methods](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenfunct_module_subroutine_guidl.htm "Guideline")) and control structures with a very deep nesting or unclear classes without clearly defined tasks. The program complexity must not be confused with the complexity of the task that is handled by the program. Even if task complexity is very high, it is always possible to keep the program complexity manageable for individual procedures and classes by clearly [separating the tasks](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenseperation_concerns_guidl.htm "Guideline").

To understand a program, the reader must be able to mentally trace the flow, and keep an eye on the different paths through the program that result from the control structure, under different external conditions. This is very difficult when dealing with voluminous procedures or deep nesting. In these situations, the program author may have been overwhelmed and consequently the program might contain errors. These situations increase the time required for corrections or further developments and the risk of errors. What makes the situation even more difficult is that testing complex procedures requires a great deal of time and effort, due to the high number of possible execution paths. Formulating a test case for every single execution path is often impossible due to the high number of paths.

Expressions

Background

An expression is part of an ABAP statement that returns a result. An expression consists of one or more operands in combination with operators or special ABAP words. Expressions can be logical expressions constructed from relational expressions and also calculation expressions. The latter type is subdivided into arithmetic expressions, bit expressions, and character string expressions. Data objects, other suitable expressions, and calls for predefined functions and functional methods can all be used as expression operands. In character string processing, regular expressions for searches and pattern comparisons are also used.

These expressions can be nested and combined in many different ways. Nested and chained calls are possible for functional methods. The maximum nesting depth of expressions is restricted to 32 by ABAP Compiler.

Rule

Limit the complexity of expressions

Use expressions at operand positions in a way that means the program remains legible and understandable.

Details

The diverse options for expressions mean that the use of helper variables is superfluous in many places. The use of expressions and functional calls at operand positions is useful under the following prerequisites:

-   The result of an expression or a calculation is required only once. If an intermediate result is required multiple times, it should only be calculated once and saved in a helper variable. (ABAP Compiler does not implicitly handle this task at the moment)

-   The data type of the result matches the operand position, or the conversion rules for an expression/call used at an operand position are suitable for the task to be implemented. If special type conversions must be performed, for example, for date or time fields, helper variables of an appropriate type might be required.

Programs should always be kept clear and legible.. Do not be too ambitious and combine everything into one single expression. If an expression becomes too complex, it should be split at suitable points, and the intermediate results should be saved in helper variables. This particularly applies to character string processing with character string templates and to regular expressions. These are very powerful but they can also make programs difficult to read very quickly. [Comments](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencomments_guidl.htm "Guideline") can also help to describe the way a complex expression works.

Bad Example

The following source code shows an arithmetic expression in a relational expression in a loop. The same total must be recalculated for each loop pass.

LOOP AT itab ASSIGNING <wa>.
  IF oref->meth( <wa> ) < sy-tabix \* ( offset + length ).
    ...
  ENDIF.
ENDLOOP.

Good Example

The following source code has the same function as the example above. However, the total is only calculated once before the loop.

limit = offset + length.
LOOP AT itab ASSIGNING <wa>.
  IF oref->meth( <wa> ) < sy-tabix \* limit.
    ...
  ENDIF.
ENDLOOP.

Nesting Depth

Background

The nesting depth is the number of statement blocks that are nested due to the use of control structures (branches, loops). We will discuss the nesting depth at the level of a procedure ([method](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenfunct_module_subroutine_guidl.htm "Guideline")). [Implementations must not](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendial_mod_event_block_guidl.htm "Guideline") occur at other points.

The maximum nesting depth is restricted to 256 by ABAP Compiler.

Rule

Restrict the nesting depth of control structures

Restrict the maximum nesting depth within a procedure ([method](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenfunct_module_subroutine_guidl.htm "Guideline")) to five levels.

Details

In addition to the [number of executable statements](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenproc_volume_guidl.htm "Guideline"), the control structures of a procedure ([method](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenfunct_module_subroutine_guidl.htm "Guideline")) are also important for their clarity and traceability. Nested branches and loops (IF, CASE, DO, WHILE, LOOP statements, etc.) become less clear and more difficult to trace with every nesting level. For this reason, the nesting depth must be restricted within a procedure, for example by moving functions to other procedures.

A maximum nesting depth of five levels is considered tolerable. A deeper nesting requires a great deal of effort to trace the program flow based on the source code. This would considerably constrain maintenance and further development.

Note

The use of modern language elements can help to restrict the maximum nesting depth. This is the case if a statement or a predefined function replaces an entire control structure, for instance, for REPLACE with the ALL OCCURRENCES addition or for the numeric extremum functions, nmax( ) and nmin( ), to determine the maximum or minimum value. The former replaces a loop, the latter an IF control structure.

Example

The transition from the bad to the good example in the rule for [modern ABAP](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenmodern_abap_guidl.htm "Guideline") shows how you can reduce the nesting depth by using modern language elements.

Procedure Volume

Background

The procedure volume is the number of executable ABAP statements in a procedure ([method](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenfunct_module_subroutine_guidl.htm "Guideline")). In theory, this number has no upper limit and is only limited by the maximum program size that fits into the current program memory.

Rule

Restrict the number of statements in procedures

Restrict the number of executable ABAP statements in a procedure ([method](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenfunct_module_subroutine_guidl.htm "Guideline")) to a manageable size. A maximum of 150 executable statements per procedure is the recommended guideline.

Details

Procedures with large volumes ([methods](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenfunct_module_subroutine_guidl.htm "Guideline")) generally have a complex decision structure, a lot of procedure parameters and work with a multitude of local data. These procedures, which often do not perform a clearly defined single task, are difficult to understand and therefore particularly prone to errors. You should use multiple small procedures with narrow interfaces and closely defined tasks. The ideal parameter interface has a small number of input parameters and only one [return value](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentype_formal_param_proc_guidl.htm "Guideline").

The number of executable statements is a simple measure of the complexity of a procedure. All statements that are not declarations and do not define processing blocks can be regarded as executable statements. This is very similar to statements at which program execution can be stopped in the debugger. Procedure-concluding statements, such as ENDMETHOD, at which you can stop in the debugger are exceptions. However, these are not regarded as executable statements.

Note

The recommendation not to write procedures that are too large should not lead to the other extreme (too many procedures that are very small). Procedures should be of a reasonable size that is consistent with the ABAP programming language ([modularize instead of atomize](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenmodularization_guidl.htm "Guideline")).

Exception

Strict linear code (for example, programmatic filling of a table with single values) cannot be subdivided into multiple procedures. In these cases, a restriction on the number of statements does not make sense.

Example

See the [KISS Principle](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenkiss_principle_guidl.htm "Guideline") figure.

Class Size

Background

The class size is the number of components (attributes, methods, events) of a class. The ABAP Compiler predefines a maximum number of 65,536 components. The total memory consumption by static attributes, instance attributes, and constants is restricted to 500KB in each case. With regards to deep data objects (tables, strings, and data references), only the fixed size of the reference is important and not the variable size of the referenced data object.

Rule

Maintain reasonable class sizes

Ensure that classes and interfaces do not contain an excessively high number of attributes, methods and events. The components contained must be class-specific and should not handle tasks that are extremely different from each other. The same applies to function groups.

Details

Complexity is not only important on the level of procedure implementations. The number of procedures to be considered and the data processed by these procedures are also very important when it comes to understanding the source code.

A class, interface or function group should not be mistaken as a container that can be used for any functionality. Function groups play the same role here as abstract final classes, which you cannot generate instances of. The function modules correspond to static public methods, and the global data corresponds to private static attributes. The situation should be viewed more as an abstraction of a certain subject or an object from real life. This modularization of a complex problem in objects of a manageable size makes it easier to understand the code. Therefore, the classes and interfaces must be designed appropriately and each class/interface must cover a manageable function that is easy to understand.

This is obviously not the case, if a class or an interface contains a large number of attributes and methods. The same applies to the number of function modules of a function group (with regard to the use of [function groups](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenabap_obj_progr_model_guidl.htm "Guideline")). Voluminous classes, interfaces, and function groups either provide functionality that is too heterogeneous or, conversely, are highly specialized, which restricts their reusability.

Besides the high degree of complexity, which makes it more difficult to maintain voluminous classes and function groups, you must consider another technical aspect: Even if you use a small part of the provided functionality, the entire class/function group is loaded into the program memory, which negatively impacts the memory usage.

Note

It is [preferable](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenproc_volume_guidl.htm "Guideline") to use multiple procedures, which are not too large and have clearly defined tasks, instead of a small number of large procedures. On the other hand, classes should not contain too many methods. However, these two rules are not contradictory, provided that the procedures do not become too small and are appropriately grouped into different classes with a clearly defined task field. In this process, very specialized classes can be created that do not require global visibility.

Functionality that is only required in a global class, function group or any other program, should therefore be encapsulated in local classes. (All functions of function groups, subroutine pools, and executable programs [should](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenabap_obj_progr_model_guidl.htm "Guideline") be implemented in local classes anyway). An example of this self-contained functionality is the display logic for [classical dynpros](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenencap_class_interf_guidl.htm "Guideline") within a function group. A meaningful reuse of classes that call the dynpros of the function group is not possible outside the function group. Therefore, local classes are the preferred elements for this task.

This procedure is also useful for global classes. By moving highly specialized functionality to smaller, local classes, you reduce the number of methods of the global class, which results in a clearer overview and makes the class easier to maintain. When you use local classes within global classes, make sure you position them appropriately to [avoid](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenlocal_type_glob_class_guidl.htm "Guideline") unnecessary dependencies.

Dead Code

Background

Dead code is program parts that are never executed because they are no longer required or were never actually required at any time. This code can accumulate during the development (rejected prototypes) or maintenance (changeover to new code without deleting the old code) of programs.

Rule

Remove dead code

Completely remove any unused or inaccessible program parts from live programs.

Details

Although dead code does not affect the executed program parts directly, it still has a negative impact on the product. Program parts that cannot be accessed during program execution do not provide any benefit. Instead they cause increased costs in the course of a program#s lifecycle because they must be identified as unused for maintenance and further development purposes. The worst case scenario is that if these program parts are not immediately recognized as unused, they will be reused or modified during further developments or refactoring measures. A lot of time and effort is wasted making changes to unused code. In addition, these program parts increase the space required in the program buffer during program execution.

Dead code also interferes with the aim of maximum [test coverage](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencorrectness_quality_guidl.htm "Guideline") by module tests using ABAP Unit or scenario tests using eCATT. Code not used in the live system is either tested, which is very time-consuming, or is not tested, which results in poor test coverage. Unused and inaccessible program parts must therefore be identified and removed as quickly as possible.

Note

[Check tools](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencheck_correctness_guidl.htm "Guideline") indicate dead code if it can be identified. Examples:

-   The syntax check warns you about unused private methods of local classes.

-   The extended program check warns you about unused declarations or statement blocks in control structures that can never be accessed.

However, these static checks can never be complete because not every use of a program part has to be statically recognizable. Therefore, the Coverage Analyzer is another important tool for isolating potential dead code.

Data Storage

ABAP programs generally work with data imported from persistent memory media to the [internal session](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abeninternal_session_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current program execution. This data is then available to the program as transient data. For performance reasons, data can also be stored in the shared memory of the current application server. This shared memory is available to all programs of an application server. Access to data in the shared memory is faster than accessing data in persistent memory media by some magnitude.

Persistent Data Storage

Background

ABAP programs can have both read and write access to data in the following persistent storage media:

-   Relational database tables in databases

-   Data clusters in special database tables

-   Binary files or text files on the application server

-   Binary files or text files on the PC if SAP GUI is used

According to the [SoC principle](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenseperation_concerns_guidl.htm "Guideline"), such accesses are wrapped in service classes of the persistency layer of an application.

Rule

Plan persistent data storage carefully

Select with care the persistent storage media that are used by the application as well as the possible data transport routes between these media. Here is a general rule of thumb:

-   Database tables for the general storage of raw data

-   Data clusters for the storage of formatted data

-   Files for data exchange with external systems

Details

When you plan persistent data storage, you should follow these steps:

1.  On an AS ABAP, storing in relational database tables is always the first choice. ABAP supports this with the Open SQL that is integrated into the language. An object-oriented access is possible using Object Services. The majority of the data is stored in the [standard database](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenstandard_db_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the application server. [Secondary connections](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensecondary_db_connection_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") (managed using [DBA Cockpit](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendba_cockpit_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")) can be used to access further databases.
2.  The following data can be stored in data clusters when using the EXPORT and IMPORT statements:
    \- Formatted data as the result of comprehensive analyses
    \- Data that is not suitable for relational databases because it does not exist in the first normal form (such as nested internal tables)
    \- Object networks after a serialization to XML
3.  The persistent storage of data in files of the application or presentation server is usually the least suitable for AS ABAP application programs because it is generally platform-dependent (code pages, byte order). In addition, such data is then only available on a particular application server, which can be problematic in a load distribution scenario with automated server selection. Such files may be required for the data exchange with external systems, however.

Under no circumstances should you use existing database tables (or files) to store data that are not provided for this purpose. Follow the convention of restricting reads and writes to database tables to specific packages. A database table must always be considered a semantic entity that is only allowed to contain the corresponding data. This even applies if a table with the required structure already exists. If in doubt, you should create a specific database table.

You must also be careful when using seemingly cross-system resources, such as the predefined INDX database table, to store data clusters. Such a resource must only be used to store temporary data for the short term, if at all. You should create specific database tables, for example, [export/import tables](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenexport_import_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), for application-specific and longer-lasting data.

Database Accesses

Background

In ABAP, data in database tables can be accessed in the following ways:

-   Open SQL
    Implemented by ABAP statements, this is a subset of the Structured Query Language (SQL) comprising the DML (Data Manipulation Language) part. The Open SQL statements use the Open SQL interface for platform-independent access to those database tables in the [standard AS ABAP database](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenstandard_db_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") defined in ABAP Dictionary and having instances created in the [ABAP database schema](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenabap_db_schema_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

-   Native SQL
    Database-specific SQL statements that include both DML and DDL (Data Definition Language) statements and which can be passed to the Native SQL interface of the database as follows:

-   The methods of [ADBC](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenadbc.htm) make it possible to execute dynamic SQL statements on a database system and process the results. ADBC (ABAP Database Connectivity), a class-based API that enables object-oriented access to the Native SQL interface.

-   Native SQL statements can be specified in ABAP programs between the statements [EXEC SQL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapexec.htm) and [ENDEXEC](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapendexec.htm). Static Native SQL statements of this kind are not checked completely by the syntax check and are forwarded almost unchanged from the Native SQL interface to the database of an AS ABAP.

-   The [AMDP framework](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenamdp.htm) is used to manage and call ABAP Managed Database Procedures. These are stored procedures or database procedures implemented as AMDP procedures in an AMDP method of an AMDP class and replicated to the database system from here.

Alongside access to the ABAP database schema of the standard AS ABAP database, all access types (except for AMDP) also allow access to other databases and other database schemas using additional [database connections](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendatabase_connection_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Rule

Use Open SQL

Use Open SQL for general persistence services where possible. Only use Native SQL and AMDP for tasks where Open SQL is not suitable.

Details

Only Open SQL is guaranteed to be independent of the database platform used. For this reason, Open SQL does not contain the set of all possible SQL statements in a specific database, but only a subset of the DML scope of all database systems supported by AS ABAP. The database tables that can be processed using Open SQL can be used in ABAP directly as structured types for the declaration of suitable work areas. Only Open SQL supports [table buffering](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensap_buffering_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of table content in the [shared memory](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenuse_shared_memory_guidl.htm "Guideline").

Native SQL and AMDP should only be used if the task really cannot be solved using Open SQL. Services that work with Native SQL are generally dependent on the database system used, so that they cannot be executed in all AS ABAP systems. For platform-independent services, implementations should be provided for all supported databases.

If the database is accessed using the Native SQL interface instead of the Open SQL interface, [ADBC](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenadbc_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or [AMDP](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenadbc_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") should be used.

-   ADBC is a modern object-oriented API that is better suited to modern ABAP programming than [EXEC SQL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapexec.htm). Enhancements to the Native SQL interface, such as bulk access using internal tables, are now only provided using ADBC. ADBC also enables [dynamic access](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendynamic_prog_technique_guidl.htm "Guideline"); Native SQL on the other hand is just static. Newer SQL statements, such as WITH for common table expressions (CTEs), are not supported in full by EXEC SQL.

-   AMDP, currently only available for a SAP HANA database as the standard AS ABAP database, is recommended for all tasks that swap out code from ABAP programs to this SAP HANA database for performance reasons.

Notes

-   The rule dictating that Open SQL is to be used for as long as possible applies in particular to [AMDP](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenamdp.htm) too. It is not a good idea to swap out SQL statements to database procedures if these could be implemented using Open SQL or [ABAP CDS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencds_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") too. In this case, no performance gains can be expected since the Open SQL statements are updated to Native SQL by the database interface in exactly the same way as they would be written in the database procedure. Using AMDP is a good idea only if HANA-specific properties can be exploited by procedure calls or if repeated transports of large amounts of data between the database and the application server can be bypassed.

-   It is [not advisable](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendatabase_access_recomm.htm) to access ABAP-managed database objects if the access does not take place in ABAP programs.

Bad Example

See the executable example [AMDP, Comparison with Open SQL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenamdp_vs_open_sql_abexa.htm). Database access not programmed well using Open SQL can often be optimized by improved use of Open SQL, making it unnecessary to use AMDP in these cases.

Good Example

See the executable example [Currency Conversion with SQL Script](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensql_script_curr_conv_abexa.htm). In this case, a specific operator of the language [SQL Script](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensql_script_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is used that is not usually available.

Client Handling

Background

A client indicates a data area in an AS ABAP database that contains independent application data. The application data of different clients use the same database tables, but are flagged with a three-figure client ID within these tables.

When logging on to AS ABAP, this client ID must be entered. This selects the client whose data is processed by the user session. The current client is entered in the system field sy-mandt.

-   [Open SQL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenopen_sql_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") statements support automatic client handling by default, where the data of the current client is accessed by default. This is specified by passing an implicit condition for the current client to WHERE conditions, and ignoring clients specified in modifying statements in work areas. Automatic client handling in Open SQL can be switched to a different client using the addition USING CLIENT or switched off using the addition CLIENT SPECIFIED.

-   [Native SQL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abennative_sql_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and [ADBC](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenamdp_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") do not implement automatic client handling. The client in question does not need to be selected explicitly when Native SQL or AMDP is used to access client-specific database tables or views.

Rule

Do not access the data of other clients

In the persistency services of business applications, access the data of the current client only.

Details

Each client within the application server is to be viewed as a self-contained unit. The additions USING CLIENT and CLIENT SPECIFIED should not be used in Open SQL statements of business applications. When Native SQL or AMDP is used, only the current client should be selected.

The system field sy-mandt does not generally need to be evaluated, unless Native SQL or AMDP is used to access client-specific database tables or views. The client ID is then needed to select the data of the current client explicitly.

Notes

-   Cross-client database tables (tables without client ID) are usually system tables. This means that cross-client access to these tables is also reserved for system programs.

-   If Open SQL has to be used to access data in a different client, USING CLIENT should be used instead of the addition CLIENT SPECIFIED, since all necessary conditions are set implicitly and accessing client-specific [CDS views](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencds_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is more simple.

Bad Example

The following source code shows an Open SQL access to a database table where the current client is specified explicitly. This makes a further explicit WHERE condition necessary. The system field sy-mandt cannot be specified directly when using the addition USING CLIENT.

SELECT SINGLE ...
       FROM dbtab CLIENT SPECIFIED
       WHERE mandt = @sy-mandt AND
             ...
       INTO ...

Good Example

The following source code shows how Open SQL is generally used for implicit automatic client handling.

SELECT SINGLE ...
       FROM dbtab
       WHERE ...
       INTO ...

Using the Shared Memory

Background

The shared memory of an application server is an highly important medium for buffering data with the goal of high-performance access. For this purpose, the shared memory can be used as follows:

-   To buffer data from database tables implicitly using [table buffering](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensap_buffering_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), which can be determined when defining the tables in ABAP Dictionary

-   To explicitly store data clusters in the cross-transaction application buffer using the statements EXPORT TO SHARED MEMORY or EXPORT TO SHARED BUFFER

-   To explicitly handle (data) objects stored there using shared objects, which are created using the addition AREA HANDLE of the statements CREATE OBJECT or CREATE DATA

Rule

Implement the explicit buffering in the shared memory using shared objects

Work with shared objects to explicitly use the shared memory for cross-program data buffering. The appropriate application scenarios are shared buffer and exclusive buffer. The access to shared objects should be wrapped in loader and broker classes.

Details

For explicit access to the shared memory, shared objects (CREATE AREA HANDLE) provide the following advantages compared to the cross-transaction application buffer (SHARED MEMORY, SHARED BUFFER):

-   Any number of (data) objects can be saved, including their mutual interdependencies.

-   (Data) objects can be used in the shared objects memory just like objects in the [internal session](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abeninternal_session_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). Technically, the shared objects memory can be considered an extension of the internal session during the time the memory is bound to it.

-   Multiple programs can access the same memory area simultaneously without having to copy data to their own internal session.

Scenarios in which shared objects can be used efficiently include the following:

-   Usage as a shared buffer
    A shared buffer contains a large data set on which many consumers can perform reads but which is changed rarely and is usually provided by a single program.

-   Usage as an exclusive buffer
    An exclusive buffer contains data that are accessed by only one program but that is maintained for various programs across transaction boundaries.

The shared memory should not be used for different purposes, if, for example this results in many modifying accesses of parallel consumers, since the current locking concept does not support this.

Access to the shared memory should be encapsulated in specific classes, and application programs should access the shared memory using these classes only. Normally, there are two classes, which can also be combined into one class:

-   A loader for creating and changing area instances

-   A broker for reads on area instances

Such wrapping ensures the following:

-   Central management of the internal session’s connection to the shared objects memory and the associated locks

-   Central exception handling and respective fallback strategies (for example, if the shared object’s memory overflows, it is possible to ensure that objects in the internal session are used without the using program having to be notified of this).

-   Potential authorization checks

This makes the application program more legible, more robust, and easier to maintain.

Bad Example

The following source code shows how an internal table index\_table, which has been formatted elsewhere and buffered in the cross-transaction application buffer, is imported to a program. To store it locally, a local data object is required. Tasks like these can be performed more efficiently by using shared objects.

"Get index page from data cluster
IMPORT index\_html = index\_html
       FROM SHARED MEMORY docutables(...) ID ...
ASSERT sy-subrc = 0.

Good Example

The following source code shows how an internal table index\_table, which has been formatted elsewhere and buffered in the shared objects memory, can be accessed within program. By calling a get method, the corresponding broker ensures that its root attribute refers to a shared object that contains the table. A local data object is then not required to access the internal table in the program.

"Get index page from shared memory
cl\_docu\_tables\_broker=>get\_index\_table( ).
ASSERT cl\_docu\_tables\_broker=>root->index\_html
       IS NOT INITIAL.

Using Shared Objects

Background

Access to [shared objects](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenabap_shared_objects.htm) is regulated by lock mechanisms. The individual locks are stored as administrative information with the area instances in the shared memory and are set and evaluated when they are accessed using area handles.

Rule

Shared buffer and exclusive buffer are suitable application scenarios for shared objects.

The access to shared objects should be wrapped in loader and broker classes.

Details

How locks work depends on how shared objects are used as follows:

-   Scenario 1 - Use as a shared buffer

A shared buffer is a data store that is rarely changed (once a day up to a maximum of once an hour), usually by a single consumer only. The amount of data can be very large. In general, many consumers can perform reads on a shared buffer at the same time. A typical use of a shared buffer is to store a catalog.

-   Scenario 2 - Use as an exclusive buffer

An exclusive buffer is a data store where only one consumer performs reads or writes or, in rare cases, where one consumer performs writes and another performs reads. The data stored in an exclusive buffer should be available longer term, that is, longer than a program’s lifetime. A typical use of an exclusive buffer is to store a shopping basket that is filled initially by the shopper and then read by the salesperson later.

General shared memory programming is not possible. The current lock logic does not enable you to set specific locks for the following requirements:

-   Many parallel reads and writes

-   Frequent writes

-   Split into modifiable and non-modifiable areas

Although the lock logic makes the first two points technically possible, they are not practical because most accesses would be rejected.

Wrapping

It is recommended that application programs do not access the shared objects memory directly. Instead reads on the shared objects should be wrapped in a wrapping class, whose methods are accessed by the individual programs. The [area constructor class](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenshm_area_constructor_class.htm) can be used as the wrapping class, for example.

Wrapping has the following advantages:

-   Central administration of an area in the shared memory

-   An application program does not need to worry about area handles and locks.

-   Central administration of locks

-   Option to implement central authorization checks

Assignments, Calculations, and Other Types of Data Access

An assignment passes the content of a data object, a return value, or a result of a calculation expression to a data object. If the data types are compatible, the content is copied unchanged. If the data types are incompatible and there is a suitable conversion rule, the content is converted. An assignment is usually performed with the [assignment operator (\=)](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenequals_operator.htm).

A calculation is executed in a calculation expression, which can be specified in an operand position, in particular on the right side of the assignment operator \=. If necessary, the result of a calculation expression is converted to the data type of the operand position or of the result of the assignment. In arithmetic expressions, the calculation is executed in a calculation type based on the data types of all operands including the result.

Assignments Between Different Types

Background

ABAP allows a direct assignment between data objects with different data types. There must be a suitable conversion rule and the content of the source field must be a meaningful value for the data type of the target field. If a suitable conversion rule is not found or the content of the source field is not suitable, an exception is raised.

Such conversions take place not only in direct assignments, but also in many operand positions and in particular in arithmetic calculations, if the specified operand does not have the data type expected at the position.

Rule

Avoid conversions

Where possible, assignments should be performed between compatible data objects with the same data type.

Details

Type conversions incur additional runtime and may not always have the result intended by the developer. Therefore, conversions should only be performed between data objects with different data types if there is no other choice. In particular, conversions should be avoided where the [conversion rules](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenuse_conversion_rules_guidl.htm "Guideline") produce unexpected results.

Bad Example

The following source code shows an arithmetic calculation involving two unnecessary conversions. First the text field literal '1' has to be converted to the calculation type i, then the result of the calculation has to be converted from type i to data type n. Such conversions produce significant increases in runtime.

DATA index TYPE n LENGTH 4.
...
DO ... TIMES.
  index = sy-index - '1'.
  ...
ENDDO.

Good Example

The following source code shows how code can be improved compared to the previous example, so that no conversions are necessary.

DATA index TYPE i.
...
DO ... TIMES.
  index = sy-index - 1.
  ...
ENDDO.

Avoiding Invalid Values

Background

For performance reasons, the ABAP runtime environment does not check whether the target field contains a valid value after each and every assignment. Particularly for target fields of the character-like data type n and the date/time types d and t, the conversion rules allow any alphanumeric values as the result of an assignment. However, only the following values are valid:

-   For type n: digits only

-   For type d: a calendar date in the format "YYYYMMDD"

-   For type t: a time in the format "HHMMSS"

For a detailed description of the validity of date fields and time fields, see also the [relevant section](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenchar_date_time_fields_validity.htm) of the documentation.

A [lossless assignment](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenlossless_assignment_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") can be used to force checks on valid values.

Rule

Only assign valid values

In assignments and calculations, data objects are filled with data types n, d, and t with valid values only.

Details

Statements that work with variables with types n, d, or t can only be guaranteed to behave correctly if values are valid. If date and time fields are required, it is important to be aware of their special characteristics. Since the initial value for variables of type d is itself not a valid value, a suitable start value must always be specified by using the addition VALUE. Note that in arithmetic calculations with date fields, if an assignment to a target field with data type d has 0 as a result value, this is an invalid initial value and may require special treatment.

If the responsibility for filling data objects of the critical data types lies elsewhere, [it is best to](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenuse_conversion_rules_guidl.htm "Guideline") always check the validity of their content before use. [Lossless assignments](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenlossless_assignment_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") with the operator [EXACT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenconstructor_expression_exact.htm) can be used to do this. Note that the initial value of a date field of type d is interpreted as valid for a lossless assignment, and the value "00010101" as invalid.

Bad Example

The following source code shows a case where the conversion rules in ABAP can lead to problems if not used properly in combination with date fields. The literals can be transferred to the date fields, without triggering an exception, to give the values 07092009 und 16092009. Unfortunately, these are interpreted as 09.20.0709 and 09.20.1609, which are invalid dates. During the calculation, they are both converted to the value 0 and the result is 0. Looking at the dates, you would expect the result to be 9.

DATA: date1  TYPE d,
      date2  TYPE d,
      result TYPE i.
date1 = '07092009'.
date2 = '16092009'.
result = date2 - date1.

Good Example

The following source code shows a date calculation that does give the expected result of 9, thanks to valid values in the date fields. The validity of the literal values is guaranteed by the use of the operator EXACT.

TRY.
    DATA(result) = EXACT d( '20090916' ) - EXACT d( '20090907' ).
  CATCH cx\_sy\_conversion\_no\_date.
    ...
ENDTRY.

The following source code shows how you can check whether the date fields are valid in the calculation, if they are not filled in the same program. Since the EXACT operator does not perform a check for compatible types, the data fields are first converted to temporary text strings, and these are checked.

TRY.
    result = EXACT d( CONV string( date2 ) ) -
             EXACT d( CONV string( date1 ) ).
  CATCH cx\_sy\_conversion\_no\_date.
    ...
ENDTRY.

Using Conversion Rules

Background

ABAP contains numerous conversion rules for assignments between data objects of different data types. These rules relate to assignments between:

-   [Elementary data objects](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenconversion_elementary.htm)

-   [Elementary data objects and structures](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenconversion_flat-elementary.htm)

-   [Structures](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenconversion_struc.htm)

-   [Internal tables](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenconversion_itab.htm)

-   [Reference variables](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenconversion_references.htm)

Assignments between data objects of nearly every different data type are possible. The only prohibited assignments are for data types for data and time specifications. Almost all permitted assignments have a corresponding conversion rule. It is especially important to have rules for assignments between data objects of the same data type, if different technical attributes (such as length or number of decimal places) are allowed. [Lossless assignments](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenlossless_assignment_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") permit only conversions that produce valid values and where no values are lost.

Rule

Avoid unexpected conversion results

Only assign data objects to each other if the content corresponds to the data type of the target field and produces an expected result. Do not exploit every ABAP conversion rule to its full extent. Consider using [lossless assignments](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenlossless_assignment_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Details

The ABAP conversion rules are based on the philosophy that assignments should be allowed between as many combinations of values as possible, without raising exceptions. In this situation, ABAP behaves quite differently from other programming languages. In other languages, assignments between different data types are usually handled much more strictly and special conversion routines or explicit casting for specific requested conversions are used.

Although it is convenient to be able to readily assign all possible data objects to each other, there are also disadvantages, such as the [creation of invalid values](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenavoiding_invalid_values_guidl.htm "Guideline"). Another example is [implicit casting](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencasting_guidl.htm "Guideline"), which occurs when assignments are made between elementary data objects and structures, or between incompatible structures.

Even if no invalid values are created, problems still can occur. If valid target values are created from invalid source values, this does not necessarily meet the expectations of the reader and it can make program maintenance considerably difficult. One example of this is the handling of invalid content in the source field in assignments from a character-like type to a byte-like type. Instead of exiting the assignment with an exception, hexadecimal zeros are passed from the first invalid character.

The only solution here are [lossless assignments](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenlossless_assignment_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") with the operator [EXACT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenconstructor_expression_exact.htm), which produce an exception in these cases. Even though this is a bit late in the day, the behavior of an assignment with the operator EXACT could be regarded as the normal, expected behavior. Other unexpected behaviors represent an implementation of special rules, which is actually the standard behavior in ABAP.

Bad Example

Anyone who is familiar with all the details of the ABAP conversion rules would probably expect an exception when the text in the following source code is assigned to the numeric text. However, only the digits of the text are respected. Therefore, the target field is given the value "00000042" instead of the value "00000007", which might also be expected.

DATA text TYPE string,
num\_text TYPE n LENGTH 8.
...
text = '4 Apples + 2 Oranges'.
...
num\_text = text.

Good Example

This issue is corrected in the source code below. The [EXACT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenconstructor_expression_exact.htm) operator is used, which triggers an exception.

...
text = '4 Apples + 2 Oranges'.
...
TRY.
    num\_text = EXACT #( text ).
  CATCH cx\_sy\_conversion\_error.
     ...
ENDTRY.

Trailing Blanks in Character Literals

Background

Trailing blanks in text field literals use memory, but are [generally](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenstring_processing_trail_blanks.htm) ignored in operand positions, like all data objects of the type c. In text string literals they are always relevant, as in all data objects of type string.

Rule

Do not use trailing blanks in text field literals

They should also not be specified in literals in any operand positions where trailing blanks are not relevant.

Details

This rule is designed mainly to make programs more readable. It makes no sense to specify literal characters in places where they are ignored, and raises expectations in users of the program that cannot be met. In particular, this also applies to the text field literal ' '.

Conversely, specifying the supposedly empty text field literal '' in places where trailing blanks are respected may be a trap.

Bad Example

The following simple example demonstrates the full scope of the rule. Any readers with little experience in ABAP would expect the result of the assignment to be a string with length six. In actual fact, the result contains only the three relevant places.

DATA text TYPE string.
text = '123'.

Good Example

Whether the example needs to be improved depends on whether the trailing blanks are required. If the blanks are needed, use a string literal:

text = \`123   \`.

If they are not needed, leave them out:

text = '123'.

Bad Example

The following example demonstrates that the supposedly empty literal '' actually represents a blank that is not cut off after SEPARATED BY. The result is "AB AP".

DATA text TYPE string.
CONCATENATE 'AB' 'AP' INTO text SEPARATED BY ''.

Good Example

Depending on whether the blank is needed as a separator, either ' ' or \`\` must be specified after SEPARATED BY to express this clearly.

Specifying Numbers

Background

There are no special literals available for numbers with decimal places, or with mantissa plus exponent. If required, these numbers must be expressed using character literals. The following notations can be used:

-   Mathematical notation
    A string of digits with a maximum of one period (.) as a decimal separator and an optional sign "+" or "-" on the left. This sign can be separated from the digits by blanks, for example: - 1234.56

-   Commercial notation
    A string of digits with a maximum of one period (.) as a decimal separator and an optional sign "+" or "-" on the right. This sign can be separated from the digits by blanks, for example: 1234.56-

-   Scientific notation
    An uninterrupted string consisting of a mantissa (an optional sign "+" or "-", digits with a maximum of one period (.) as a decimal separator), a character e or E, and an exponent (an optional sign "+" or "-" and further digits), for example: -1.23456E03

Rule

Use globally valid notation for numeric values

When using numbers in character strings that are intended for assignments to a numeric data object, create them so that they are accepted by all possible target types. The sign must always be on the left, and there must be no blanks.

Details

When converting a character string to a numeric variable, the type of the target variables decides which notations are accepted:

-   If the type of the target variable is decfloat16 or decfloat34, all three notations are accepted.

-   If the type of the target variable is f, all three notations are accepted. The mathematical and commercial notations are only accepted, however, if the sign is not separated from the string of digits by one or more blanks and there are blanks in front of the string of digits.

-   If the type of the target variable is p or i, only the mathematical and commercial notations are accepted.

To make sure that a program is readable, and also that numbers in character strings can be converted to as many numeric data types as possible, always use mathematical notation without blanks between the sign and the string of digits. This notation also confirms to other standards, such as the canonic representation of XML schema data types.

Bad Example

The following source code demonstrates the initialization of a generically typed parameter with commercial notation, where the sign is separated by a blank. If an actual parameter with a type other than f is passed, the assignment produces the value -1000 (as expected); if an actual parameter of the type f is passed, however, the value is +1000.

CLASS class DEFINITION.
  PUBLIC SECTION.
    METHODS calculate\_something
      EXPORTING number TYPE numeric.
ENDCLASS.
CLASS class IMPLEMENTATION.
  METHOD calculate\_something.
    number = '1000 -'.
    ...
  ENDMETHOD.
ENDCLASS.

Good Example

The following source code demonstrates an assignment using globally valid notation that is easy to read and which produces the same result, the value -1000, for all numeric data types.

METHOD calculate\_something.
number = '-1000'.
...
ENDMETHOD.

Selecting the Numeric Type

Background

Multiple numeric types with various properties and value ranges are available in ABAP, which can be used for storing numbers and for calculations:

-   Signed 4-byte integer numbers (type i) and 8-byte integer numbers (type int8) (1-byte and 2-byte-integers with the internal types b and s are also available.) However, these data objects cannot be created based on a predefined ABAP type. Instead, the predefined ABAP Dictionary types INT1 and INT2 are required.

-   Packed numbers in BCD format (binary coded decimals, type p)

-   Binary floating point numbers (type f)

-   Decimal floating point numbers (types decfloat16, decfloat34)

The decimal floating point numbers meet the requirements for highly exact processing of decimal numbers in a large value ranges, where the data types p and f only cover a single aspect each.

Rule

Choose suitable numeric types for numbers and calculations

Choose a numeric type to suit the values to be represented to achieve the highest possible speed and accuracy. Here is a general rule of thumb:

-   i and int8 for integers

-   p for fixed point numbers

-   decfloat16 or decfloat34 for floating point numbers

-   f in exceptional cases only

Details

The calculation speed and accuracy are generally contradictory requirements and depend on the data type of the objects to be processed. Therefore, when choosing the numeric type, both these two requirements must be weighed up. These considerations must also include the value range to be represented:

-   If the values to be mapped are integers, type i or int8 must usually be used. This guarantees the highest possible calculation speed. Examples of these integers include counters, indexes, offsets and time intervals. If the values to be mapped exceed the value range of type int8 or i, you can use type p without decimal places instead. The calculation speed is slower, but decimal places are still represented accurately (except for rounding errors). If this value range is still not sufficient, a floating point type (decfloat16 and decfloat34) can be used instead.

-   If non-integer values that have a fixed number of decimal places are to be represented, the type p can be used. However, calculations with type p are executed in the ABAP kernel and not by the hardware. Examples of non-integer values include lengths, weights, or monetary amounts. If this value range is still not sufficient, a decimal floating point type (decfloat16 and decfloat34) can be used instead. The binary floating point type f is less suitable because it cannot represent all decimal fractions. This is a further impediment for calculation accuracy (in addition to the unavoidable rounding errors).

-   For non-integer values with a variable number of decimal places or a large value range, the decimal floating point types decfloat16 or decfloat34 should be used. Decfloat34 has a greater number of places and a greater value range. However, this also leads to increased memory consumption.

Thanks to the hardware support available on all platforms, binary floating point type f allows fast calculations. However, it is inferior to the new decimal floating point types due to the following reasons:

-   Type f can only accurately represent fractions with the power of two in the denominator (1/2, 1/4, 1/8, etc.) and totals. Other values are rounded according to this representation. This rounding process does not correspond to the decimal rounding process (and usually does not meet the expectations of the developer or user). For example, the value 0.815 is approximated internally as 8.1499999999999995E-01. This means when the value is rounded to two decimal places, 0.81 is returned instead of the expected value 0.82.

-   Very large numbers can no longer be represented exactly (working in line with IEEE 754) if the difference between the largest and smallest exponent is greater than 52 (in the total of powers of two). For example, 1E+23 is represented as 9.9999999999999992E+22.s

-   A number of type f cannot be rounded to a specific number of decimal places, if the result needs to be assigned to another number of type f.

-   Divisions by powers of 10, which often occur when converting metric units, for example, are not exact. 8.0500000000000005E-01 is returned for 805/1000, for example.

-   Simple calculations often produce unexpected results. 123456.15 - 123455 returns 1,1499999999941792, for example.

-   The conversion of binary floating point numbers to other number formats is not clearly defined in line with IEEE 754. Consequently, when data is stored in the database, the rounding behavior depends on the platform and how numbers of type f are represented in the database.

-   The decimal floating point types decfloat16 and decfloat34 do not have these problems. Both have a greater value range than type f, and decfloat34 has 34 places instead of 16 places. However, the following restrictions apply:

-   Currently, calculations with decimal floating point types are generally even slower than calculations with the type f (the speed is comparable to calculations with the type p). Until now, only IBM's Power6 architecture provided hardware support for floating point calculations of this type in accordance with IEEE-754-2008. On other platforms, calculations with decimal floating point numbers have to be performed on the software side in the ABAP kernel, in a similar way to calculations with the type p.

-   Decimal floating point types are not yet supported by associated data types on all database platforms. As an interim solution, ABAP Dictionary provides a set of predefined data types DF16\_..., DF34\_..., based on existing types (DEC and RAW). In most cases, the benefits of the decimal floating point types compensate for the current slow calculation speed. However, it might still be necessary to use type f if there are stringent requirements for performance and less stringent requirements for calculation accuracy. Remember that the speed advantage currently possible for calculations with f, may be outweighed by the fact that conversions from f to other numeric types are relatively slow.

Note

For programs that are currently created with decimal floating point types, the performance is increased as soon as the processor architecture supports decimal floating point calculations and the ABAP runtime environment starts using this hardware support. Calculations with decimal floating point numbers then become faster than calculations with packed numbers.

Bad Example

The following source code shows a declaration of a binary floating point number. The start value 0.815 is assigned. The true start value, however, is 8.1499999999999995E-01.

DATA number TYPE f VALUE '0.815'.

Good Example

The following source code shows a declaration of a decimal floating point number. The start value 0.815 is assigned. The true start value is actually 8.15E-01.

DATA number TYPE decfloat34 VALUE '0.815'

Rounding Errors

Background

In the case of assignments between floating point numbers (types f, decfloat16, decfloat34) and fixed point numbers (types i and p), rounding errors usually occur that produce an incorrect value. However, values of type p (and also decfloat16 and decfloat34) assigned to type f are not always displayed accurately.

Rule

Avoid unnecessary rounding errors

Avoid unnecessary or frequent conversions between floating point numbers and fixed numbers as this can cause rounding errors.

Details

In a program, the value of a number should always be stored for as long as possible in a data object with the numeric data type of the highest required level of accuracy. This applies especially to saving intermediate results of calculations.

The data input or output requirements (for example, formatting on the screen or in a spool list) cannot change the way numbers are saved internally. If a number is to be formatted using a specific number of decimal places, the actual value should not be converted to the corresponding packed number. Instead, a suitable format should be configured in a character-like field using the relevant constructs. These are character string templates and previously the statement WRITE TO.

Bad Example

The following source code shows a calculation where results can be assigned to a numeric field intended for output. The result 55.55 is rounded to 56.00.

DATA: output     TYPE p DECIMALS 2,
      percentage TYPE decfloat34,
      value TYPE decfloat34.
percentage = '55.55'.
value      = '100.0'.
output = percentage / 100.
output = value \* output.

Good Example

The following source code corrects the above example by separating the code into data objects intended for calculations and a character-like data object for the formatted output.

DATA: result TYPE decfloat34,
      percentage TYPE decfloat34,
      value TYPE decfloat34.
DATA output TYPE c LENGTH 40.
percentage = '55.55'.
value      = '100.0'.
result = percentage / 100.
result = value \* result.
WRITE result TO output DECIMALS 2 EXPONENT 0.

Division by Zero

Background

Division by zero is forbidden in all recognized programming languages and raises an exception. This is also the case in ABAP, but with the difference that the exception cx\_sy\_zerodivide is not raised if the dividend is also zero when divided by zero. In this case, the division in ABAP produces the result 0.

Rule

Prevent division by zero

Do not exploit the fact that ABAP permits division by zero if the dividend itself is zero.

Details

This ABAP behavior is arbitrary and does not produce the result expected by the user. Avoid using it if at all possible. Instead, set preconditions that avoid division by zero or specify explicitly that the correct exception is raised for the case 0/0.

Example

The following source code always raises an exception when the divisor has the value 0.

IF divisor <> 0.
   result = dividend / divisor.
ELSE.
   RAISE EXCEPTION TYPE cx\_sy\_zerodivide.
ENDIF.

Casting

Background

Casting refers to the process of handling a data object by assuming a certain data type. This definition is different to the meaning of the concept in other programming languages, such as Java. Here, casting means a different concept which is referred to as 'conversion' in ABAP. Casting in ABAP is either explicit or implicit:

-   Explicit casting is possible by using the CASTING addition with the ASSIGN statement and by using the ASSIGNING addition in statements for processing internal tables. Assignments between reference variables allow [up casts](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenup_cast_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and [down casts](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendown_cast_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). Obsolete explicit casting is also possible for formal parameters and field symbols, if the STRUCTURE addition is used.

-   Implicit casting is sometimes performed for special assignments or during operand handling at certain operand positions. A common example is the handling of flat structures using character-like-only components as a single field of type c.

Rule

Avoid implicit casting

Avoid implicit casting. If a cast to another data type is required, it can usually be implemented explicitly using ASSIGN ... CASTING.

Details

Implicit casting can potentially occur if structures are used as follows:

-   Assignments between incompatible structures or structures and elementary data objects

-   Comparisons between structures and elementary data objects

-   Using structures in operand positions where elementary data objects are expected

-   Reads from the database using SELECT \* ... INTO wa

-   Using the INCREMENT addition for the ASSIGN statement

The use of implicit casting is prone to errors and produces source code that is difficult to understand. If the CASTING addition is used when handling field symbols, explicit casting can be implemented, which is easier to follow and understand. The explicit casting option is a very important reason to [use field symbols](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendyn_access_data_obj_guidl.htm "Guideline").

Bad Example

The following source code shows the assignment of a text string to a structure with only character-like components. An implicit casting occurs here, which is regarded as unwanted according to the above rule. The entire structure is handled as a text field of type c and length 6.

TYPES: BEGIN OF structure,
         comp1 TYPE c LENGTH 2,
         comp2 TYPE c LENGTH 4,
       END OF structure.
DATA structure TYPE structure.
DATA text TYPE string.
...
text        = ...
structure = text.

Good Example

The following source code improves the example above, by assigning the structure to a field symbol of type c. Explicit casting occurs. Only the character-like field symbol is used to handle the structure as a character-like field.

...
FIELD-SYMBOLS <text> TYPE c.
...
ASSIGN structure TO <text> CASTING.
<text> = ...

Runtime Errors When Accessing Data Objects

Background

Using data objects can cause runtime errors if the data object contains unsuitable content or the access to the data object is unsuitable. Examples:

-   Assigning values outside the value range of a target variable

-   Using values that cannot be converted to the required type. In other words, a conversion rule exists but the source field content is not convertible. For example, you are trying to assign a character field (with content that cannot be interpreted as a number) to a numeric field.

-   Access to parts of data objects (substring access). Either offset access/length access or the use of predefined subfunctions such as substring.

Rule

Prevent runtime errors when accessing data objects

You need to prevent runtime errors that can occur when accessing data objects. Robust applications should always be programmed to avoid these errors.

Details

If it is not possible to determine whether subsequent access causes errors by filling data objects appropriately, either the relevant properties must be checked before the data is accessed or possible exceptions (subclasses of CX\_SY\_CONVERSION\_ERROR or CX\_SY\_DATA\_ACCESS\_ERROR) must be caught during data access.

Bad Example

The following source code illustrates a typical situation that can easily cause a runtime error if the subarea defined by offset and length is not defined in text.

DATA text TYPE string.
...
substring = text+offset(length).
...

Good Example

The following two pieces of source code illustrate how the above example can be changed to avoid runtime errors using prevention or exception handling.

IF strlen( text ) > offset + length.
  substring = text+offset(length).
ELSE.
  ...
ENDIF.

TRY.
  substring = text+offset(length).
CATCH cx\_sy\_range\_out\_of\_bounds.
   ...
ENDTRY.

Anonymous Containers

Background

Anonymous containers are character-like or byte-like data objects of type c or string type (or x/xstring type). Data objects of other types (especially structures) are assigned using [casting](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencasting_guidl.htm "Guideline") to these objects, to store them persistently in these containers.

Rule

Do not use character or byte fields as containers

Do not store structured data in unstructured character-like or byte-like variables.

Details

The direct storage of structured data in unstructured character-like or byte-like data objects is problematic, particularly with data exchanges using remote function calls (RFC), input/output through the file system or output to a printer. Unexpected results can occur due to platform-specific byte orders (endianness), alignment requirements and different character sets (code pages).

For example, if a container is stored and imported to an application server with a different byte order, problems will occur if the container is used for content for which the byte order is critical. In other words, the numeric fields of types i, decfloat16, decfloat34 and f. The order of the character-like data objects of bytes is also dependent on the platform in the character representation [UCS-2](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenucs2_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the programming language ABAP.

Even without these technical problems, it can difficult to correctly import data that has been stored as described above. You usually have to perform another casting operation for the data type of the data stored in the container. However, as the relevant type information is not saved with the data, it might not be possible to perform type-friendly casting.

Note

If data needs to be saved in an unstructured container, the statement EXPORT ... TO DATA BUFFER can be used. This type of data storage is robust compared to different platform properties. However, you cannot use EXPORT and IMPORT to directly edit reference variables or instances referenced by them. As a workaround, you can serialize these variables and instances for storage by using the statement CALL TRANSFORMATION. A class must include the IF\_SERIALIZABLE\_OBJECT tag interface, so that its objects can be serialized using CALL TRANSFORMATION.

Pass by Reference of Global Data

Background

In a local context you can normally directly access the [data objects](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendata_type_obj_guidl.htm "Guideline") of superordinate more global contexts. For example, it is possible in a method to perform writes on the attributes of itsc class and on any global data of the current program.

Therefore, if a more global data object is passed to a procedure by reference, access is granted there both through its name and the formal parameter.

Rule

Do not pass global data to local contexts using pass by reference

Do not use global data as actual parameters for formal parameters of procedures if you can change them in the procedure in another way, and the parameter is passed by reference.

Details

If a global data object that has also been passed by reference is changed in a procedure ([method](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenfunct_module_subroutine_guidl.htm "Guideline")), this also changes the formal parameter and vice versa. This behavior is not usually anticipated when writing the procedure.

Global data is only supposed to be passed to formal parameters for which [pass by value](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentype_transf_formal_para_guidl.htm "Guideline") is declared, or to procedures that are guaranteed not to have any unwanted consequences for this data.

Bad Example

After the do\_something method has been called in the main method in the following source code, the attr attribute contains the unexpected value 2.0, because the first assignment to the c\_value changing parameter, which has been passed by reference, also changes attr.

CLASS class DEFINITION.
   PUBLIC SECTION.
     METHODS
       main.
   PRIVATE SECTION.
     DATA
       attr TYPE p DECIMALS 2.
     METHODS
       do\_something CHANGING c\_value TYPE numeric.
ENDCLASS.
CLASS class IMPLEMENTATION.
   METHOD main.
     attr = '1.23'.
     do\_something( CHANGING c\_value = attr ).
   ENDMETHOD.
   METHOD do\_something.
     ...
     c\_value = floor( attr ).
     ...
     c\_value = c\_value + attr.
     ...
   ENDMETHOD.
ENDCLASS.

Good Example

If the pass by reference method in the method declaration of do\_something in the above example is converted into a pass by value method, as shown in the following source code, the attr attribute contains the expected value 2.23 after the method has been called.

...
     METHODS
       do\_something CHANGING VALUE(c\_value) TYPE numeric.
...

System Fields

An ABAP program can request the status of the ABAP runtime environment using the [system fields](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensystem_fields.htm). From a technical viewpoint, these system fields are a set of predefined variables - the components of the predefined sy structure of data type SYST from the ABAP Dictionary - that are always available while the program is running.

The system field sy-repid is an exception. This field indicates the name of the program currently running. In this case, we are dealing with a predefined constant and not a component of the predefined sy structure.

Access

Background

The system fields are supplied with values by the ABAP runtime environment. In a program, however, they behave like normal variables. You can assign values to these fields using the ABAP program. This is because both the ABAP kernel and the ABAP components of the ABAP runtime environment have can perform writes on system fields.

Rule

Do not write to system fields

In application progrsms, only perform reads on system fields and never perform writes.

Details

The values of system fields are usually vital for correct program execution. This means performing writes on system fields carries a lot of risk. Write operations in system fields can lead to a loss of important information, which can prevent programs from running correctly. Therefore, you cannot overwrite system fields to change the execution of the program or use the fields to replace explicitly defined variables.

In addition, you cannot misuse system fields as implicit output parameters of procedures, irrespective of whether the fields have been explicitly set within the procedure (due to an illegal write or as the result of an executed statement).

Exception

The only system fields where it was permitted to change the field content (in an application program) are part of classic list processing. This should [no longer be used](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenlist_guidl.htm "Guideline").

Bad Example

The following source code shows a write performed on the system field sy-subrc, which occurs frequently. This write is not harmful but it also is not beneficial: sy-subrc is always set to zero when a function module is called and only adopts a different value by handling a classic exception. Therefore, the statement is redundant.

sy-subrc = 4.
CALL FUNCTION ...
   ...
   EXCEPTIONS ...
CASE sy-subrc.
   ...

Good Example

The source code below omits the write shown above.

CALL FUNCTION...
   ...
   EXCEPTIONS ...
CASE sy-subrc.
   ...

Obsolete and Internal System Fields

Background

Not all system fields are designed to be used in application programs. All available system fields can be displayed as components of the structure SYST in ABAP Dictionary (or as components of the structure sy in the debugger). The meaning of the components is included in the accompanying description. Any system fields that are [obsolete](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensystem_fields_obsolete.htm) or only to be [used internally](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensystem_fields_internal.htm) are clearly marked.

Rule

Do not use obsolete or internal system fields

In application programs, do not use system fields flagged as obsolete or for internal use only in ABAP Dictionary or in the ABAP documentation.

Details

The behavior of obsolete and internal system fields is undefined. This means that ABAP application programs must not make any assumptions about the content of these system fields.

Bad Example

The following source code shows how the system field sy-fodec, flagged for internal use, is used illegally in the structure SYST after the statement DESCRIBE FIELD to count the number of decimal places in a data object.

DATA dobj TYPE p LENGTH 8 DECIMALS 2.
DATA type TYPE c LENGTH 1.
DATA decimal TYPE i.
DESCRIBE FIELD dobj TYPE type.
decimals = sy-fodec.

Good Example

The following source code demonstrates how decimal places can be counted correctly using the appropriate addition of the statement DESCRIBE FIELD.

DATA dobj TYPE p LENGTH 8 DECIMALS 2.
DATA type TYPE c LENGTH 1.
DATA decimals TYPE i.
DESCRIBE FIELD dobj TYPE type DECIMALS decimals.

Evaluation

Background

System fields describe general system states or are set specifically by individual statements. The content of system fields is only defined as described in the documentation of the system fields or in the documentation of ABAP statements that set system fields. In contexts other than those described there, the content of system fields is not defined. Particularly statements whose effects on system fields are undocumented can modify the content of specific system fields, such as the [return value](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenreturn_value_guidl.htm "Guideline") sy-subrc, in an undefined way. This applies especially to statements that call ABAP code implicitly or explicitly when executed.

Rule

Evaluate system fields in the right position

Evaluate system fields only in contexts for which they are defined. If an ABAP statement sets a system field in accordance with its documentation, the field should be evaluated directly after the statement. You must not evaluate system fields after statements, however, whose effects are undocumented.

Details

If possible, a system field should be evaluated directly after the statement that set it, to prevent it from being overwritten by other statements. The bigger the gap between the ABAP statement in question and the evaluation of a system field, the higher the risk that this system field will be influenced by a different statement in the meantime.

If necessary, the values of system fields should be saved in auxiliary variables. This applies in particular to the general [return value](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenreturn_value_guidl.htm "Guideline"), sy-subrc, which is set by very many different statements. Other common examples include the syindex loop counter or the sy-tabix table index.

You should never evaluate statement-related system fields after statements that do not set these fields according to their documentation. As before, a common example is the evaluation of sy-subrc. If it is not documented for a statement that it sets sy-subrc in a defined way, an evaluation after this statement is very risky. Either sy-subrc still has the previous value, or it is set in an undefined way by the statement. Both outcomes can lead to incorrect program behavior. The bad example in the [extended program check](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenextended_program_check_guidl.htm "Guideline") section shows an example of this.

Note

The static methods of the class CL\_ABAP\_SYST also provide important system states. There is no possibility of a previous overwriting in the program.

Bad Example

The following source code shows an example where sy-subrc is evaluated too late. Even if it is not documented for the statements between FIND and IF that they set sy-subrc, the value can be overwritten due to possible side effects.

FIND REGEX ... IN ...
...
... "other statements
...
IF sy-subrc = 0.
   ...
ENDIF.

Good Example

The following source code corrects the above example by assigning sy-subrc to a helper variable directly after FIND. This variable is then evaluated in IF. It can also be necessary to assign sy-index or sy-tabix to a helper variable directly after DO or LOOP loop is entered.

FIND REGEX ... IN ...
find\_subrc = sy-subrc.
...
... "other statements
...
IF find\_subrc = 0.
   ...
ENDIF.

Return Code

Background

The most prominent system field should be the return code sy-subrc. This indicates the successful execution of an ABAP statement or, if you are [using classic exceptions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenuse_exception_class_guidl.htm "Guideline"), a procedure. A return code of 0 usually means that the execution was successful.

Rule

Evaluate the return code sy-subrc

Evaluate the return code sy-subrc after every ABAP statement that sets the value according to the documentation. However, sy-subrc should never be set after statements are executed for which the setting of a return code is not documented.

Details

The system field sy-subrc indicates whether a statement was successfully executed. If the execution was not successful, the program should usually react accordingly. If this does not happen, the program's response will probably be unexpected.

This rule is a specialization of the more general rule [evaluate system fields in the correct place](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenevaluation_guidl.htm "Guideline"). It is specified here again separately due to the prominent role of the return code sy-subrc. The system field sy-subrc must always be evaluated immediately and, if necessary, assigned to a help variable. An evaluation cannot occur after statements that set sy-subrc not defined, because otherwise wrong conclusions could easily be drawn.

Note

Special care must be taken in [functional method calls](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapcall_method_functional.htm). If executed successfully, each method call sets the return code sy-subrc to 0, which means that functional method calls overwrite the return code when used in statements where the setting of the return code is not documented. The same applies to the instance operator [NEW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenconstructor_expression_new.htm) when instances of classes are created.

Exception

If a handling action seems unnecessary because, in the developer's opinion, the statement is always executed successfully, the assumption should at least be saved and documented using an [assertion](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenassertions_guidl.htm "Guideline").

Bad Example

The following source code shows how further processing of data is performed using the work area of a SELECT command, without a request from sy-subrc. However, the content of wa is usually undefined here, if a request from sy-subrc does not guarantee that database access will be successful.

SELECT ...
       INTO wa
       ...
... "work with wa

Good Example

The following source code corrects the above example. This means the successful execution of the SELECT statement is checked.

SELECT ...
       INTO wa
       ...
IF sy-subrc <> 0.
  ...
ENDIF
... "work with wa

Using System Fields as Actual Parameters

Background

The structure sy exists once in an [internal session](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abeninternal_session_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and is shared by all programs in this internal session. The components of sy represent the system fields. System fields are global for all programs of an internal session and their procedures.

Rule

Do not use system fields as actual parameters

Never use system fields as actual parameters - especially not for passing by reference.

Details

This rule reinforces the rule [do not pass global data to local contexts by reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenref_transf_global_data_guidl.htm "Guideline"). Since system fields are set implicitly, it is important to be even more careful. If the value of a system field changes implicitly within a procedure, the value of the parameter passed by reference, which refers to this system field, also changes. Procedures are never prepared for this behavior.

Even pass by value should be avoided for system fields. This is because a procedure might be switched to pass by reference in an enhancement process, without the consumer of the procedure being notified. The only secure method is to assign the value of a system field to a normal variable and then use this variable as the actual parameter when calling the program.

Bad Example

Looking at the method do\_something in the following source code, it could be expected that the parameter index in the loop to contain the unchanged value that was passed to the procedure. In fact, index references sy-index, which is set to the current loop counter in the DO loop.

CLASS class DEFINITION.
  PUBLIC SECTION.
    METHODS main.
  PRIVATE SECTION.
    METHODS do\_something IMPORTING index TYPE i.
ENDCLASS.
CLASS class IMPLEMENTATION.
  METHOD main.
    DO 2 TIMES.
      do\_something( sy-index ).
    ENDDO.
  ENDMETHOD.
  METHOD do\_something.
    DO 3 TIMES.
      ... index ... .
    ENDDO.
  ENDMETHOD.
ENDCLASS.

Good Example

The following source code corrects the call of the do\_something method. A helper variable is passed with the corresponding value instead of sy-index.

...
CLASS class IMPLEMENTATION.
  METHOD main.
    DATA index TYPE sy-index.
    DO 2 TIMES.
      index = sy-index.
      do\_something( index ).
    ENDDO.
  ENDMETHOD.
  ...
ENDCLASS.

Using System Fields on the User Interface

Background

As system fields are defined using the syst structure in ABAP Dictionary, you can technically use them to define input fields in dynpros/in Web Dynpro.

Rule

Do not use system fields on the user interface

Never use system field types to define input or output fields for dynpros or selection screens in application programs.

Details

This rule is derived from the [SoC](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenseperation_concerns_guidl.htm "Guideline") rule and the [use of data types rule](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenusing_types_guidl.htm "Guideline"). System fields are purely technical. Their semantic attributes, are defined in ABAP Dictionary (documentation and other texts), do not allow meaningful use in the user dialogs of application programs.

Note

Similarly, you can apply the rule [only use semantically appropriate data types](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenusing_types_guidl.htm "Guideline") to the use of SYST structure components (for typing interface parameters of procedures). The semantic meaning of a system field (expressed in the short text) does not generally match the meaning of the parameter.

Example

When the program PGL\_SYSTEM\_FIELD\_ON\_UI is executed, input fields for document output language are displayed on a classic dynpro. The first input field is declared with reference to data type syst-langu of system field sy-langu. The second input field is declared with reference to a semantically suitable ABAP Dictionary data type. The displayed F1 help clearly indicates that syst-langu is not suited for language fields in a user dialog. This is because the help only describes the behavior of the sy-langu field in a program. It does not describe the meaning of the language field in the relevant application.

Using Elements in Operand Positions

Background

Statements that modify the content of system fields generally evaulate the operands first and then set the system fields. In some complex statements, however, a system field could be set first, before all operand positions are evaluated.

Rule

Do not use system fields in statements that set the fields

For reasons of robustness, do not use system fields as operands of statements that themselves set these system fields.

Details

A program does not always define whether a particular system field is set in a statement before or after an operand is evaluated. This means that, to reduce risks and to make the program easier to read, the content of a system field should always be copied to an auxiliary variable and only this copy should be used within the statement in question.

Note

Also take note of how functional methods are used in operand positions. These methods also modify important system fields. Also be careful here when using system fields in operand positions of the same statement.

Bad Example

The following source code shows how the system field sy-tabix is used in a READ statement that sets the system field itself. The case shown here does not itself present any difficulties, however we still recommend you follow the rule above, not least to make the code more readable.

LOOP AT itab1 ... WHERE ...
   ...
   READ TABLE itab2 ... INDEX sy-tabix.
   ...
ENDLOOP.

Good Example

The following source code makes the example above more robust by assigning the value of the system field sy-tabix to an auxiliary variable before it is used.

LOOP AT itab1 ... WHERE ...
   index = sy-tabix.
   ...
   .... itab2\[ index \] ...
   ...
ENDLOOP.

Modularization units

Die wesentlichen Modularisierungseinheiten bzw. aufrufbaren Einheiten innerhalb eines ABAP-Programms werden als Verarbeitungsblöcke bezeichnet. Hierbei wird nach Prozeduren auf der einen und Dialogmodulen sowie Ereignisblöcken auf der anderen Seite unterschieden. Während Dialogmodule und Ereignisblöcke aus der Dynpro-Ablauflogik oder im Rahmen der Ereignissteuerung durch die ABAP-Laufzeitumgebung aufgerufen werden, sind die Prozeduren für den direkten Aufruf aus einem ABAP-Programm heraus vorgesehen. Neben Verarbeitungsblöcken können auch noch Makros als aufrufbare Einheiten angelegt werden.

Procedures can be:

-   Methods

-   Function modules

-   Subroutines

Only procedures support parameter interfaces and have a local data context.

Dialog modules and event blocks do not have parameter interfaces and generally do not have a local data context.

Macros are a kind of halfway house between callable units and source code modularization.

Function Modules and Subroutines

Background

Function modules and subroutines are the [procedures](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenmodularization_guidl.htm "Guideline") of the structured programming model that already existed before the introduction of ABAP Objects.

-   Function modules in function groups are independent repository objects that the structured model provides for [external calls](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenintern_extern_proc_call_guidl.htm "Guideline") or for the provision of reusable functions.

-   Before the introduction of ABAP Objects, subroutines could be created in any programs and were intended for internal calls or for the internal modularization of programs in the structured model.

The introduction of ABAP Objects means that methods now have both roles.

Rule

No implementations in function modules and subroutines

Only use function modules and subroutines if they are necessary from a technical viewpoint. In these cases, do not implement the required function. Instead, call the relevant (local) methods.

Details

This rule is directly derived from rule [Use ABAP Objects](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenabap_obj_progr_model_guidl.htm "Guideline"). This rule states that only methods should be created. You are only [allowed](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenabap_obj_progr_model_guidl.htm "Guideline") to create other types of procedures if is technically not possible to use a method:

-   Function modules for RFC, updates, and access to classical dynpros or selection screens

-   Subroutines for PERFORM ON COMMIT/ROLLBACK and GENERATE SUBROUTINE POOL

These subroutines should only be used for wrapping method calls to ensure that ABAP Objects is also used in these cases.

All the rules in these programming guidelines that relate to procedures actually refer to methods because, strictly speaking, no other procedures with nontrivial code are supposed to occur. If you strictly adhere to the above rule, is almost impossible for any of the rules that refer to implementations of procedures to be applied to function modules and subroutines, because they only serve to wrap calls. For example, function modules and subroutines should no longer contain any of the local declarations that are described in ["Defining Local Declarations at the Start of a Procedure"](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenlocal_declar_guidl.htm "Guideline").

If you cannot adhere to the rule ["Use ABAP Objects"](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenabap_obj_progr_model_guidl.htm "Guideline") and the above rule because, for example, existing legacy function modules and subroutines need to be maintained or enhanced and you cannot switch to methods, the rules in these programming guidelines that refer to procedures also apply to function modules and subroutines.

Type of Formal Parameters in Procedures

Background

The parameter interface of a procedure consists of formal parameters and specifies the [exceptions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenclass_exception_guidl.htm "Guideline") possible in the procedure. The possible types of formal parameters are:

-   Input parameters
    Defined using IMPORTING in methods and function modules and using USING in subroutines.

-   Output parameters
    Defined using EXPORTING in methods and function modules.

-   Input/output parameters
    Defined using CHANGING in methods, function modules, and subroutines.

-   Return codes
    Defined using RETURNING in methods.

The actual behavior of a formal parameter, however, is in part determined by the combination of the parameter type and the [pass by type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentype_transf_formal_para_guidl.htm "Guideline").

Rule

Choose the appropriate formal parameter type

Select a formal parameter type that corresponds to the parameter semantics:

-   Input parameters for parameters that are evaluated but not changed in the procedure.

-   Output parameters or return codes for parameters that are not evaluated but changed in the procedure.

-   Input/output parameters for parameters that are evaluated and changed in the procedure.

Details

For the consumer of a procedure, the parameter types provide important information about how they are used in the procedure and leads the user to expect the procedure to behave in a certain way. If an unsuitable parameter type is selected, the risk of inappropriate use increases.

-   Input-only parameters should always have the IMPORTING type (or USING for subroutines). Be aware that, when using pass by reference, writes performed on an input parameter defined using USING are possible without a syntax error being produced (as is the case with input parameters of methods or function modules defined using IMPORTING). Yet another reason to not use subroutines.

-   Output-only parameters should always be EXPORTING or RETURNING.

-   Parameters that are received and changed should always be of the CHANGING type. In particular, in a procedure ([method](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenfunct_module_subroutine_guidl.htm "Guideline")) the fact that an EXPORTING parameter (or a USING parameter in the case of subroutines) passed by reference [behaves](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenref_transf_output_param_guidl.htm "Guideline") (from a technical perspective) like a CHANGING parameter should not be exploited.

Input parameters or input/output parameters that are not necessarily required for the execution of a procedure should be defined as optional by using OPTIONAL or by specifying a DEFAULT value. Otherwise, calling programs are forced to pass unnecessary parameters and create helper variables especially for this purpose.

A narrow parameter interface in line with a [procedure with an appropriate number of statements](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenproc_volume_guidl.htm "Guideline") only requires a few input parameters and one return value. However, this cannot really be applied consistently in practice and is therefore not set out as a rule here.

Note

Another parameter type are table parameters that can be declared for function modules and subroutines using TABLES. Basically, they have the same effects as input/output parameters for internal tables. This parameter type is obsolete and should no longer be used.

Bad Example

The following source code shows a formal parameter that is declared as an output parameter using EXPORTING, but is used in the method like an input/output parameter declared with CHANGING. This does not correspond to the semantics that a calling program expects.

CLASS class DEFINITION.
  PUBLIC SECTION.
    METHODS do\_something
      EXPORTING e\_parameter TYPE ...
ENDCLASS.

CLASS class IMPLEMENTATION.
  METHOD do\_something.
    "evaluate e\_parameter
    ...
    "set e\_parameter
    ...
  ENDMETHOD.
ENDCLASS.

Good Example

The following source code corrects the above example by declaring the parameter as an input/output parameter with CHANGING according to its use.

CLASS class DEFINITION.
  PUBLIC SECTION.
    METHODS do\_something
      CHANGING c\_parameter TYPE ...
ENDCLASS.

CLASS class IMPLEMENTATION.
  METHOD do\_something.
    "evaluate c\_parameter
    ...
    "set c\_parameter
    ...
  ENDMETHOD.
ENDCLASS.

How Formal Parameters Are Passed

Background

Parameters can be passed to procedures either by reference or by value.

-   Pass by reference
    In the case of pass by reference, a reference to the actual parameter is passed to the procedure when it is called. The procedure then works with the actual parameter. No local data object is created for the actual parameter. Input parameters that are passed by reference cannot be changed in the procedure (exception: USING parameters of subroutines).

-   Pass by value
    In the case of pass by value, a type-friendly local data object is created as a copy of the actual parameter for the formal parameter. The system initializes output parameters and return values when the procedure is started. Input parameters as well as input/output parameters receive the value of the actual parameter. A changed formal parameter is only passed to the actual parameter if the procedure is completed without errors.

IMPORTING parameters that are passed by reference are protected from explicit changes within the procedure. This is not the case for the pass by value method. RETURNING parameters always require the pass by value method.

Rule

Choose a suitable pass-by type

When selecting the pass-by type, consider both speed and security:

-   Pass by value for small data sets for security reasons

-   Pass by reference for large data sets for performance reasons

Details

The pass by reference method generally has a higher performance than pass by value because no values need to be copied. This speed advantage can be noticed especially in the case of large parameters, such as internal tables or strings, or in mass data processing. In the case of small, flat parameters, the pass by value method usually does not lead to problems because the copy costs incurred are not high here. Furthermore, for strings and internal tables, sharing takes effect in the case of pass by value. Consequently, only references are passed here. The time-intensive copy process is skipped if the data objects involved are only to be read-accessed, such as in the case of EXPORTING parameters that are filled within a procedure ([method](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenfunct_module_subroutine_guidl.htm "Guideline")), and are not modified by the calling program after the pass.

Despite the speed advantage, the pass by reference method can lead to problems due to the following aspects:

-   EXPORTING parameters that are passed by reference are not initialized automatically. Therefore, such parameters are [not supposed to be read](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenref_transf_output_param_guidl.htm "Guideline") until the first value has been assigned to them.

-   Writes performed on EXPORTING and CHANGING parameters with the pass by reference method work directly on the actual parameters. Their values are also modified if the procedure ([method](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenfunct_module_subroutine_guidl.htm "Guideline")) is left early due to an exception.

-   IMPORTING parameters that are passed by reference change if the actual parameter changes. The actual parameter can change, for example, if it is a [global variable](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenref_transf_global_data_guidl.htm "Guideline") or a [system field](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenuse_actual_parameters_guidl.htm "Guideline").

If passing by value does not cause performance problems, that is, if small data sets are passed or sharing can be used, this method should be used for security reasons. If speed is an issue, pass by reference should be chosen. In this case, the potential risks of implementing the procedure ([method](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenfunct_module_subroutine_guidl.htm "Guideline")) must be [considered](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenref_transf_output_param_guidl.htm "Guideline").

Example

See the example in the section about [Code Inspector](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencode_inspector_guidl.htm "Guideline"). In this example, an internal table is passed by reference due to performance reasons, while an elementary parameter is passed by value due to robustness reasons.

Pass By Reference for Output Parameters

Background

When parameters are passed to a procedure by reference, this procedure directly uses the data object that has been passed as a parameter. Its value is consequently determined by the calling program of the procedure. Particular notice must be made of this behavior for EXPORTING parameters, whose value is (unlike the pass by value method) not initialized when the procedure is called. After the procedure has started, an output parameter that was passed by reference has the value of the supplied actual parameter.

Rule

Use output parameters correctly with pass by reference

Do not evaluate EXPORTING parameters that are passed by reference in a procedure ([method](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenfunct_module_subroutine_guidl.htm "Guideline")) until a value has been explicitly assigned.

Details

Because the value of an output parameter that has been passed by reference is undefined from the procedure’s perspective, it cannot be evaluated within the procedure in a useful manner. Therefore, no assumptions can be made regarding the content of the parameter until the first value has been assigned to it.

If a parameter like this is an internal table or a string, a simple write is not sufficient. First, an initialization must be implemented. For example, if new rows are to be inserted in an internal table that is supposed to be produced by reference, its current content needs to be deleted first. Pass by reference means that it cannot be guaranteed that the table is actually empty when the procedure is started. The same applies to strings that are filled using concatenation operations within the procedure.

Note

If the described properties are to be exploited for writable parameters that have been passed by reference in a procedure ([method](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenfunct_module_subroutine_guidl.htm "Guideline")), that is, a read is to be performed prior to the write or an existing dynamic data object is to be extended, the [appropriate formal parameter type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentype_formal_param_proc_guidl.htm "Guideline") must be specified, that is, input/output parameter (CHANGING parameter).

Exception

Strictly speaking, optional output parameters that have been passed by reference must be initialized only if the parameter is bound to an actual parameter when called. This can be determined using the IS SUPPLIED query. The obsolete query, IS REQUESTED, in contrast, should no longer be used.

Example

The following source code shows how an internal table that, for performance reasons, is implemented by reference is returned. For this reason, it cannot be declared as a RETURNING parameter. The tabular output parameter is explicitly initialized at the beginning of the method before new lines are inserted.

Typing of Formal Parameters

Background

The typing of formal parameters can be full or generic. Formal parameters of methods must be, and formal parameters of function modules and subroutines should be, explicitly typed using the TYPE or LIKE addition. When you connect actual parameters to formal parameters, the system checks whether the data type of the actual parameter corresponds to the typing of the formal parameter.

-   Full typing completely defines the data type of a formal parameter and applies to both dynamic access and static access to the formal parameter.

-   Generic typing does not define the data type of a formal parameter in full. Instead, the actual data type of the supplied actual parameter is used. The attributes of the actual parameter apply to dynamic access performed on formal parameters like this. The attributes defined by the typing apply to static access.

For generic typing, a set of predefined generic types is available in ABAP, which are only intended for the typing of formal parameters and field symbols. Using them in any other way can lead either to errors or to missing attributes being filled with default values. The generic types are: any, any table, c, clike, csequence, data, decfloat, hashed table, index table, n, numeric, object, simple, sorted table, standard table, table, x, and xsequence. Self-defined table types without fully specified table keys are also generic.

Rule

Be as specific as possible when typing formal parameters

Be only as generic as necessary when typing formal parameters. Fully generic types (any) should be the exception rather than the rule. When used, a formal parameter must be compliant with all possible fixed types.

Details

Absolute type security within a procedure can only be achieved using full typing. It should always be used when providing a generic service is not a defined goal. It is much easier to carry out [tests](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencorrectness_quality_guidl.htm "Guideline") for non-generic services than for generic services.

A generically typed procedure interface usually involves more implementation effort within the procedure ([method](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenfunct_module_subroutine_guidl.htm "Guideline")) to avoid [runtime errors](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenruntime_error_dyn_proc_guidl.htm "Guideline"). Therefore, use the following principle when providing generic interfaces: as little generic typing as possible and as much generic typing as necessary. You should use specific generic types, such as numeric or csequence, instead of any or data, for example, if services are involved that are supposed to process numeric values or character strings. If csequence is used, the potential fixed types c and string must display different behavior with respect to trailing blanks or the potential numeric types in calculations for numeric must produce different [calculation types](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencalculation_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). More specifically, when existing typings are generalized, it may be necessary to modify the implementation accordingly.

Generic typing can be a pitfall if you are not aware that you have used generic typing instead of full typing, because only the technical type attributes are checked when an actual parameter is connected, but no component names, for example. This can lead to different behavior than expected.

Note

These rules for typing also apply to [field symbols](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendyn_access_data_obj_guidl.htm "Guideline").

Bad Example

The following method shows different behavior when a blank is passed as a string of the type string or as a text field of the type c.

CLASS demo DEFINITION.
  PUBLIC SECTION.
    CLASS-METHODS main IMPORTING flag TYPE csequence.
ENDCLASS.
CLASS demo IMPLEMENTATION.
  METHOD main.
    IF flag = abap\_false.
      ...
    ENDIF.
  ENDMETHOD.
ENDCLASS.

Good Example

Using the predefined function [condense](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencondense_functions.htm) produces the same behavior when a blank is passed, regardless of the fixed type.

CLASS demo DEFINITION.
  PUBLIC SECTION.
    CLASS-METHODS main IMPORTING flag TYPE csequence.
ENDCLASS.
CLASS demo IMPLEMENTATION.
  METHOD main.
    IF condense( flag ) = abap\_false.
      ...
    ENDIF.
  ENDMETHOD.
ENDCLASS.

Bad Example

The example in the following source code shows the trap you can fall into, particularly when working with table types, if the table key is not specified in full their declaration (in a program or in ABAP Dictionary). Due to the missing key specification, the table type that is used to type the formal parameter of sort\_itab is generic. While the first static sort is successful, the second SORT statement fails and triggers a runtime error. For the dynamic component specification, the attributes of the actual parameter apply to the formal parameter, and the actual parameter does not have the col2 component (this can also be tracked in the ABAP Debugger).

CLASS class DEFINITION.
  PUBLIC SECTION.
    TYPES: BEGIN OF struc,
              col1 TYPE type1,
              col2 TYPE type2,
           END OF struc,
           itab TYPE STANDARD TABLE OF struc.
    METHODS: main,
             sort\_itab CHANGING c\_itab TYPE itab.
ENDCLASS.

CLASS class IMPLEMENTATION.
  METHOD main.
    TYPES: BEGIN OF struc,
             col1 TYPE type1,
             col3 TYPE type2,
           END OF struc.
    DATA itab TYPE STANDARD TABLE OF struc
              WITH NON-UNIQUE KEY col1 col3.
              ...
     sort\_itab( CHANGING c\_itab = itab ).
  ENDMETHOD.
  METHOD sort\_itab.
     SORT c\_itab BY col1 col2.
     SORT c\_itab BY ('COL1') ('COL2'). "<- Runtime error!
  ENDMETHOD.
ENDCLASS.

Good Example

The following source code shows a very simple correction of the typing in the above example. Because the primary table key is specified in full, the type used is no longer generi, and dynamic sorts work like static sorts.

...
itab TYPE STANDARD TABLE OF struc
     WITH NON-UNIQUE KEY col1 col2.
...

Internal and External Procedure Calls

Background

When a procedure is called, a distinction is made between internal and external procedure calls. An internal call calls a procedure of the same program, whereas an external call calls a procedure of a different program. The major difference between internal and external procedure calls is that the program might have to be loaded first for an external call. With internal calls, the program is already loaded. Possible external calls, where a program might have to be loaded, include:

-   Methods of global classes in class pools

-   Function modules in function groups

-   Subroutines in all programs that can contain subroutines (PERFORM...IN PROGRAM)

-   Methods of local classes, where the name of the class is specified dynamically using an absolute type name (\\PROGRAM= ... \\CLASS=...\\)

The programs loaded within an [internal session](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abeninternal_session_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") are grouped into program groups. There is always one main program group and a number of optional additional program groups. Each program group contains a main program and possibly several additional programs (loaded due to external use). The loaded programs are not always the result of a call. The reason could also have to do with other references to components of external programs, such as a reference to a visible data type of a global class. The loaded programs are not always the result of a call. The reason could also have to do with other references to components of external programs, such as a reference to a visible data type of a global class.

If shared resources of the program group are accessed in an externally called procedure, the information about which program group the program was loaded into is very important. Whether a program creates a separate program group when loaded or whether it is loaded into an existing program group, largely depends on the program type:

-   Class pools and function groups (and external calls of global class methods or function modules) always create a new program group when loaded.

-   If subroutines or methods of local classes of other program types (not class pools and function groups) are called externally, the programs are loaded into the program group of the calling program.

Rule

Only call suitable procedures externally

Only call procedures externally that are intended for external calls. The methods of global classes and function modules are intended for external calls. Subroutines and the methods of local classes are not designed for external calls.

Details

The only procedures designed for external calls are the visible methods of global classes and function modules. The master programs of these procedures are always main programs of their program groups and the procedure always works with the resources of this program group.

However, external calls of subroutines and dynamic calls of methods in local classes of other programs are problematic. Usually, subroutines and local classes are intended for internal use within their program. External calls are not anticipated during the development phase. (On the other hand, no problems occur when an already loaded program deliberately passes a reference to an object of a local class to another program). Therefore, these subroutines and local classes should always be handled as private components of the program, even though they are technically public.

In addition, an assignment to a particular program group is not statically defined. Because the call order can depend on user actions or data contents, the program of the called procedure can belong to the main program group in one instance and can belong to an additional program group in another instance. This does not define which program group the shared resources belong to. The shared resources are:

-   Classic dynpros (including selection screens and classic lists) and GUI statuses

The classic dynpros and GUI statuses are always shared within a program group (the classic dynpros and GUI statuses of the main program in this program group). For example, the CALL SCREEN statement in an externally called procedure always calls a dynpro of the main program of the program group and not a dynpro of the master program of the procedure. The response to user actions in the dynpro (called as described above) is also handled in the main program of the program group.

-   Interface work areas

Interface work areas are defined as table work areas using the TABLES and NODES statements or using the obsolete statement DATA ... COMMON PART. They are only created once for each program group and are shared by the main program and the loaded additional programs.

Note

Except for the warning regarding dynamic calls of methods of local classes from other programs, this rule is basically intended to raise the awareness of problems when using existing programs. In new programs, the creation of new subroutines and the use of [shared resources](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentable_work_area_guidl.htm "Guideline") are largely obsolete anyway. The problems mentioned above can only occur if classic dynpros or selection screens (and therefore GUI statuses and table work areas) are used.

Example

The following source code demonstrates how to assign interface work areas to program groups, in the case of external subroutine calls. The table work area dbtab declared in sapssubr is shared either with sapmprog or with saplfugr. If share has the value 'FUGR', saplfugr and sapssubr share the table work area. Otherwise it is shared by sapmprog and sapssubr. It is not possible to rely on a specific assignment.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*
PROGRAM sapmprog.

...
IF share = 'FUGR'.

Exiting Procedures

Background

You can exit procedures in the usual way using the END... statement or by using one of the following statements:

-   RETURN

-   EXIT

-   CHECK log\_exp

These statements end a procedure properly, that is, the system passes output parameters for which passing by value is specified and returns values to the assigned actual parameters. In addition, you can terminate the processing of a procedure as follows, without supplying the actual parameters with values:

-   Calling another unit (program, dynpro) without returning to the procedure

-   Triggering an exception or sending a dialog message if an [error occurs](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenerror_handling_guidl.htm "Guideline")

Rule

Only use RETURN to exit procedures

Use the statement RETURN to properly exit a procedure (method, see rule [no implementations in function modules and subroutines](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenfunct_module_subroutine_guidl.htm "Guideline")) early.

Details

The statement RETURN is used to exit procedures and always has this result. The behavior of the EXIT and CHECK statements (conditional exit), in contrast, is context- dependent: Within a loop, only the loop is exited; outside a loop, the surrounding procedure is exited. This ambiguity limits the legibility of source code. Therefore, EXIT and CHECK should only be used to exit loops, and RETURN only to exit procedures. Only RETURN enables you to exit a procedure in a loop context.

Note

As well as the statements RETURN, EXIT, and CHECK specified here, the statements REJECT and STOP can be used to exit special [event blocks](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendial_mod_event_block_guidl.htm "Guideline"). Conversely, RETURN, EXIT, and CHECK can also exit processing blocks other than procedures. In both cases, you must consider the particular behavior of the ABAP runtime environment regarding the exited processing block. Because other processing blocks are only supposed to contain one method call according to the rules [use ABAP Objects](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenabap_obj_progr_model_guidl.htm "Guideline") and [no implementations in dialog modules and event blocks](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendial_mod_event_block_guidl.htm "Guideline"), these cases should no longer occur in new programs.

Exception

An exception to the rule to only use RETURN to exit procedures are CHECK statements that are located at the beginning of a procedure and that check the prerequisites for the execution of the procedure there. Using the CHECK statement in such a way does not impair the legibility and is thus allowed. However, this exception does not apply to other positions within a procedure and outside loops.

Bad Example

The following source code shows how a method is left early with a CHECK statement, whose meaning cannot be identified by simply looking at it. You have to know that CHECK exits the procedure if the following logical expression is wrong, which is why a double negation is necessary here.

METHOD some\_method.
   ...
   CHECK is\_finished = abap\_false.
   ...
ENDMETHOD.

Good Example

The following source code corrects and simplifies the above example by implementing a conditional exit with an IF control structure that is easy to read.

METHOD some\_method.
   ...
   IF is\_finished = abap\_true.
      RETURN.
   ENDIF.
   ...
ENDMETHOD.

Dialog Modules and Event Blocks

Background

Besides procedures, there are two further types of processing blocks. However, they do not have a parameter interface and do not allow declaration of local data: (AT SELECTION-SCREEN and GET are exceptions but they should not be exploited):

-   Dialog modules
    Dialog modules are introduced using the statement MODULE and ended using the statement ENDMODULE. These modules form the functional interface between classic dynpros and the associated ABAP program. They are called from within the dynpro flow logic.

-   Event blocks
    Event blocks are introduced by the corresponding keyword and implicitly ended by the next processing block. The processing of an event block is triggered by the ABAP runtime environment when the relevant event occurs. There are event blocks for:

-   Loading a program (LOAD-OF-PROGRAM)

-   Reporting events that occur during the processing of an executable program (with a logical database) (INITIALIZATION, START-OF-SELECTION, GET, END-OF-SELECTION)

-   Selection screen events (AT SELECTION-SCREEN ...)

-   List events of classic list processing (AT LINE-SELECTION, AT USER-COMMAND)

Rule

No implementations in dialog modules and event blocks

Only use dialog modules and event routines if they are necessary from a technical viewpoint. In these cases, do not implement the required function. Instead, call the relevant (local) methods.

Details

Since it is not possible to declare local data in dialog modules and event blocks, you cannot implement any useful program logic. Therefore, dialog modules and event blocks — provided that they are still necessary — should only contain one method call. If you [use ABAP Objects](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenabap_obj_progr_model_guidl.htm "Guideline") consistently, only the following elements are required:

-   LOAD-OF-PROGRAM or INITIALIZATION as the program constructor in cases where [program types](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenprogram_type_guidl.htm "Guideline") other than class pools are used

-   Dialog modules and AT SELECTION-SCREEN when [classic dynpros and selection screens](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenencap_class_interf_guidl.htm "Guideline") are processed

-   START-OF-SELECTION in [executable programs](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenprogram_type_guidl.htm "Guideline") for background processing To improve readability, you should always specify the statement explicitly (although it is optional in many situations).

-   Although possible in the syntax, you should never specify an event block more than once within a program.

Note

Using LOAD-OF-PROGRAM in a function group is basically the same as using a static constructor in a global class. In executable programs, you can use INITIALIZATION instead, if any parameters passed using SUBMIT need to be evaluated.

Example

The following source code shows the PAI modules of the function group DEMO\_CR\_CAR\_RENTAL\_SCREENS from the package SABAP\_DEMOS\_CAR\_RENTAL\_DYNPRO. The screens in this package can be called using transaction DEMO\_CR\_CAR\_RENTAL. These dialog modules adhere to the above rule. They do not contain their own implementations. They call methods of a local class of the function group.

MODULE cancel INPUT.
  screen\_handler=>cancel( ).
ENDMODULE.

MODULE user\_command\_0100 INPUT.
  screen\_handler=>user\_command\_0100( ).
ENDMODULE.

MODULE customers\_mark INPUT.
  customer\_table=>mark( ).
ENDMODULE.

MODULE reservations\_mark INPUT.
  reservation\_table=>mark( ).
ENDMODULE.

Macros

Background

A [macro](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenabap_macros.htm) is a summary of a statement list for internal reuse within a program between [DEFINE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapdefine.htm) and [END-OF-DEFINITION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapend-of-definition.htm). The statement list is included in another position in the program by specifying the macro name. A macro can contain up to nine placeholders, &1 to &9, in place of ABAP words and operands (or parts of operands). These placeholders must be replaced by fixed words when the macro is included.

Rule

Only use macros in exceptional cases.

We recommend that procedures ([methods](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenfunct_module_subroutine_guidl.htm "Guideline")) or expressions with appropriate operators are used instead of macros.

Details

Macros are often used as callable units, instead of real procedures. This is rarely a good idea however. Macros do not have a real context, and cannot be executed in steps in ABAP Debugger. This makes it practically impossible to look for errors in programs that use large or complex macros. For these reasons, a macro cannot be viewed as a worthy replacement for a genuine procedure.

In addition, in the past macros were not just used to replace procedures, they were also used to perform recurrent declarations of structured data. Today, macros are, of course, avoided and [standalone types](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenbound_independent_dtype_guidl.htm "Guideline") are used instead.

Nowadays, expressions can be used instead of macros in many cases. One example is using the value operator [VALUE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenconstructor_expression_value.htm) to fill internal tables, which makes it unnecessary to use macros (which mostly contain the statement APPEND.

In certain cases, however, the use of macros could be justified, as long as the statement patterns are simple and recurring. Here, a macro can be seen as a design-time generation tool. The following (good) example shows how a macro can be used in this way. In a situation like this, a macro may be preferable to a procedure for the following reasons:

-   The statement list in the macro is clear and simple enough that it does not matter that it cannot be debugged.

-   The syntax check performs static checks on the correctness of the statements. When using the dynamic language methods required in a procedure, any errors (in this case, incorrect names) would not be detected until runtime. [Dynamic access](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendynamic_prog_technique_guidl.htm "Guideline") would also be more time-consuming.

-   Unlike listing all statements separately, using these macros makes the source code clearer, particularly if the statement list is repeated frequently. There is a lower risk of trivial typing errors being made, since there is no need to create and edit a large volume of similar source code. It is easier to make subsequent changes to the logic.

This means that, in certain cases, using macros can improve the correctness and maintainability of source code. Macros that contain non-trivial control structures, however, always present a maintenance problem because they cannot run in steps in ABAP Debugger. For this reason, use macros very sparingly and only if they contain no more than a few lines. Errors in macros are almost impossible to analyze.

Note

As well as existing in the source code of a program, macros can also be saved as cross-program macros in type groups. However, no new macros should be defined in type groups.

Bad Example

The following source code is an example where a macro is an unsuitable replacement for a genuine procedure. In this case, the macro could only be used once and in a single context, since the work area wa can only be declared once there. In this example, a procedure with dynamic components would be a better idea.

DEFINE get\_data.
  DATA wa TYPE &1.
  SELECT SINGLE \*
         FROM &1
         WHERE &2 = @&3 AND
               &4 = @&5
         INTO @wa.
END-OF-DEFINITION.

get\_data spfli carrid 'LH' connid '0400'.

Good Example

The following source code shows an example where using a macro could be a good idea. Here, a few simple statement lists (assignments enclosed in IF) are to be repeated often. The names of the operands are also very regular. This function could also be implemented using other means (such as a procedure) by using dynamic means to access the variables or by expanding every IF block. In this particular case, however, using a small macro makes the program far easier to understand and edit.

TYPES: BEGIN OF value\_and\_flag,
         value TYPE string,
         flag TYPE c LENGTH 1,
       END OF value\_and\_flag.

TYPES: BEGIN OF structure,
         component\_up TYPE value\_and\_flag,
         component\_down TYPE value\_and\_flag,
         ...
         component\_top TYPE value\_and\_flag,
       END OF structure.

DATA struct TYPE structure.

DEFINE macro\_set\_value\_if\_flag\_is\_set.
   IF struct-component\_&1-flag = abap\_true.
      struct-component\_&1-value = &2.
   ENDIF.
END-OF-DEFINITION.

...

macro\_set\_value\_if\_flag\_is\_set up 'ABC'.
macro\_set\_value\_if\_flag\_is\_set down 'IJK'.
...
macro\_set\_value\_if\_flag\_is\_set top 'XYZ'.

Using Dynamic Programming Techniques

Background

The use of dynamic programming techniques includes the following:

-   Accessing dynamic memory objects, that is, dynamic data objects (strings and internal tables), as well as instances of classes and anonymous data objects

-   Dynamically accessing data objects using reference variables and field symbols (to a certain extent, this also includes accessing generically typed formal parameters in procedures)

-   Dynamically invoking procedures or entire programs

-   Creating data types generically and using them to create anonymous data objects

-   Generic progam development, where parts of the statements are specified using dynamic tokens or entire programs are not created until runtime

In this sense, handling reference variables can also be considered a dynamic technique. The dynamic type (the object to which the reference refers) can be more specific than the static type of the variable, which entails polymorphic behavior and becomes apparent during assignments in the form [up casts](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenup_cast_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or [down casts](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendown_cast_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Rule

Use dynamic programming techniques with care

Use dynamic programming techniques only when this is necessary and reasonable. Use only as many dynamic language elements as required to carry out the assigned task.

Details

The advantage of dynamic programming techniques is an increased flexibility when creating programs. Dynamic programming techniques enable flexible and generic services to be developed that meet various requirements. The price to be paid for this advantage is that dynamic programming techniques may decrease the static checkability, legibility, maintainability, testability, performance, and also [security](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenabap_security.htm). [Security standards](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencorrectness_quality_guidl.htm "Guideline") may even prohibit the use of high-risk dynamic programming techniques.

This section describes various dynamic programming techniques. These range from [using strings](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenstrings_guidl.htm "Guideline"), which we explicitly recommend, and [using internal tables](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenitab_guidl.htm "Guideline"), which form a basis of ABAP programming, to [generating entire programs](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abengeneric_progr_guidl.htm "Guideline"), which we advise against. The higher the dynamics, the more comprehensive the precautionary measures to be taken when using these techniques. Already the simple access to data objects involves a corresponding partial aspect, which was addressed in the rule for [Runtime Errors when Accessing Data Objects](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenruntime_error_dyn_proc_guidl.htm "Guideline"). The rules in this section expand these specific rules and provide a more general framework.

Always consider the following aspects when deploying dynamic techniques:

-   Programs that work with dynamic techniques are usually more complex and harder to understand than programs that use only static techniques. This has a negative effect on maintainability.

-   In dynamic programming, many checks that are otherwise performed in compilations can be performed only at runtime. This considerably increases the risk of exceptions or runtime errors.

-   Checking the dynamic parts at runtime can reduce the processing speed, as the checks must be repeated each time the parts are used again.

-   More tests are required, since numerous states of a dynamic program and possible error situations must be checked.

-   If used wrongly, dynamic programming techniques can present a serious security risk. Any dynamic content that is passed to a program from the outside must be checked thoroughly or escaped before being used in dynamic statements. This can be done using the system class CL\_ABAP\_DYN\_PRG or the predefined function [escape](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenescape_functions.htm).

The significance of these aspects differs for the various dynamic programming techniques. For example, a program that uses strings is by no means more complex than a program that works only with text fields. In cases like this, a range of details must nevertheless be taken into account.

Runtime Errors in Dynamic Processing

Background

When dynamic techniques are used, various exception situations can arise that can never occur when the corresponding static techniques are used because they can be checked statically.

Rule

Prevent runtime errors in dynamic processing

Respond appropriately to all possible error situations when using dynamic techniques.

Details

The different dynamic techniques also require different reactions to the possible exception situations. Examples:

-   When dynamic data objects are accessed, [their limitations must not be violated](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenruntime_error_data_obj_guidl.htm "Guideline"). For internal tables, for example, no row numbers must be specified for which no row exists.

-   Before data objects are accessed dynamically by using data references or field symbols, it must be ensured, before execution, that these are bound to a data object and this binding checked using IS BOUND or IS ASSIGNED, if necessary. Afterwards, the return value should be checked to see whether execution was successful.

-   In dynamic calls, exceptions must be caught that are raised due to nonexistent programs, classes, or procedures, or due to inappropriate parameters.

-   In the case of a dynamically specified token, for example, a dynamic WHERE condition in Open SQL or internal tables, possible exceptions must be caught and responded to accordingly.

-   If programs are developed generically, the programs in question must checked using the statement SYNTAX-CHECK.

These examples illustrate how the use of dynamic techniques can lead to more complex and less clear code due to the numerous possible exception situations. Of course, the more the mentioned techniques are combined, the more complex and less clear the code becomes. Therefore, [dynamic programming techniques must always be used with care](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenuse_dynamic_progr_tech_guidl.htm "Guideline").

Note

If it is not possible to particular error situations, for example, because no exception that can be handled exists, it must be ensured that this error situation never occurs and this then verified in extensive test scenarios.

Bad Example

The seemingly legible source code section uses almost only dynamic operands and tokens. Neither ABAP Compiler nor the reader can know the content of the specified variables at runtime. An error in one of these variables results in a termination of the program.

READ TABLE where\_clauses ASSIGNING <where\_clause> WITH ...
DELETE FROM (dbtab\_name) WHERE (<where\_clause>).
IF sy-subrc = 0.
  CALL METHOD (class\_name)=>(method\_name).
ENDIF.

Good Example

The following source code corrects the above example with an appropriate error handling — this reduces the legibility, of course. Here, the fact that an initial dynamic WHERE condition means that no restrictions are imposed is also taken into account. As shown here, this case must be explicitly avoided. Otherwise, the entire table content will be deleted.

UNASSIGN <where\_clause>.
ASSIGN where\_clauses\[ ... \] TO <where\_clause>.
IF sy-subrc <> 0.
   RAISE EXCEPTION ...
ENDIF.
ASSERT <where\_clause> IS ASSIGNED.
IF <where\_clause> IS NOT INITIAL.
   TRY.
       DELETE FROM (dbtab\_name) WHERE (<where\_clause>).
     CATCH cx\_sy\_dynamic\_osql\_error.
       ...
   ENDTRY.
   IF sy-subrc = 0.
      TRY.
            CALL METHOD (class\_name)=>(method\_name).
          CATCH cx\_sy\_dyn\_call\_error.
            ...
       ENDTRY.
   ENDIF.
ENDIF.

Using Dynamic Data Objects

Background

Dynamic data objects are a subgroup of [dynamic memory objects](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenmem_cons_dyn_mem_obj_guidl.htm "Guideline") and simply consist of:

-   Strings

-   Internal tables

The data type statically defines all properties for dynamic data objects, apart from memory consumption. Although the objects are managed internally using references, they are addressed by their names and value semantics applies. This means the referenced internal reference is always used for access.

Rule

Use appropriate dynamic data objects

To store dynamic data sets transiently when using dynamic data objects, always select the type that best corresponds to the content and the required access:

-   Strings for data that cannot be divided

-   Internal tables for data that can be divided

To avoid memory bottlenecks for large data sets, you might need to use other procedures as well.

Details

When using dynamic data objects, selecting the type is a key decision. The general rule is:

-   Data that can be handled as one piece is stored as a character string or byte string (string or xstring data type).

-   Structured data or data that can be sensibly divided into individual sections is stored as internal table rows.

However, if you need to store a very large data set as dynamic data objects, different aspects must be considered. String and xstring data objects must be stored as one piece in the memory, whereas the content of internal tables is stored in blocks. This is more likely to cause resource bottlenecks when strings are used. Even if sufficient [memory](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenmem_cons_dyn_mem_obj_guidl.htm "Guideline") space is available, the memory cannot handle a string of the requested length, due to fragmentation. In these cases, it makes more sense to store the data as an internal table instead of storing the data in a string as one piece.

The EXPORT statement for storing data in a cluster supports both storage types, for example: EXPORT ... TO DATA BUFFER stores the cluster in a single long byte string, whereas EXPORT ... TO INTERNAL TABLE distributes the cluster across numerous rows of an internal table. The latter possibility (EXPORT ... TO INTERNAL TABLE) is more secure (for the reason explained above), if the cluster needs to contain a very large data set.

Note

Strings and internal tables are predefined in the ABAP language as data types and the corresponding access statements. In other programming languages, however, they are often implemented as libraries (such as string classes and container classes). In ABAP, it is usually [neither necessary nor useful](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenobj_oriented_guidl.htm "Guideline") to define specific classes for storing strings or table-like data. However, in rare cases, it may be useful to wrap internal tables in classes, to release more [memory](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenadmin_costs_dyn_mem_obj_guidl.htm "Guideline") when data is deleted.

Memory Consumption of Dynamic Memory Objects

Background

In dynamic objects, the actual data is addressed using a reference. This means that dynamic memory objects are always deep objects. Possible dynamic memory objects are:

-   Table bodies of internal tables addressed using internal table references

-   Text strings or byte strings addressed using internal string references

-   Anonymous data objects created using CREATE DATA and addressed using data references in data reference variables

-   Instances of classes created using CREATE OBJECT and addressed using object references in object reference variables

The maximum total size and number of all dynamically managed memory objects in an [internal session](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abeninternal_session_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") are defined in principle by the maximum amount of memory that this session can request to execute programs.

Alongside the available memory on the application server, there are two further technical limits that can restrict the size of individual dynamic memory objects:

-   The upper limit is 2³¹-1 for the size of a string in bytes (in the character representation [UCS-2](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenucs2_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") used by the ABAP programming language, every character in a string occupies 2 bytes) and the number of rows in an internal table.

-   The memory for the content of a string and for hash management of an internal hashed table must be provided as one piece. Therefore, the ztta/max\_ memreq\_mb profile parameter is relevant for these two memory object types. It defines the maximum amount of memory that can be requested as one piece. A maximum size for strings and a limitation on the number of rows in hashed tables can be directly derived from this amount. This limitation does not depend on the width of table rows. Only the hash management (and not the table content) must be provided as one piece in the memory. The current limitation is the highest power of two, which is less than or equal to an eighth of the value specified by the profile parameter. For example, if the profile parameter specifies 250MB, a hashed table can contain approximately 16 million rows.

Any attempt to exceed these limits produces a runtime error and the termination of the program.

Rule

Avoid memory bottlenecks

When using dynamic memory objects, ensure that the program is not terminated due to a lack of memory.

Details

Memory limits are fixed limitations that cannot be deactivated with programming. To avoid memory bottlenecks, we recommend that you account for:

-   The limits of the available physical memory when developing a program

-   The specified technical limits for strings and hashed tables

The only way to prevent memory limits from being exceeded is to use programming to restrict the data loaded into the memory. This applies to processing large data sets and also to object creation. The latter can produce memory bottlenecks if overly large objects or too many small objects are created. Memory leaks (unused, unreleased memory) can also cause memory problems.

Editing Large Data Sets
You need to process large data sets that are stored in a persistent repository as one piece, but the sets do not fit into the available memory. In this case, you must import and process these data sets, either in packages or sequentially. A common language element here is the PACKAGE SIZE addition. You can this addition when importing large data sets to internal tables with the SELECT Open SQL statement. Memory-saving processing of large strings (Large Object, LOB) in database tables is also possible. Locators enable you to access substrings of strings in database tables. Streaming allows a sequential and gradual transfer of data into the memory. Both concepts were predominantly introduced in ABAP to avoid memory bottlenecks.

Releasing Memory
The main advantage of dynamically managed memory is that it can be released again. Use this option to delete data and objects no longer required, to avoid memory leaks and possible memory bottlenecks:

-   You can delete strings using the CLEAR statement.

-   You can use CLEAR or FREE to delete internal tables. FREE releases the entire memory space occupied by rows, whereas the initial memory requirement of the table remains reserved if CLEAR is used. An appropriate size for the [initial memory requirement](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abeninitial_memory_requ_guidl.htm "Guideline") is usually defined by the ABAP runtime environment itself. However, it can also be predefined using the INITIAL SIZE addition.

-   Anonymous data objects and instances of classes are deleted by the Garbage Collector, after all reference variables that refer to these objects have been initialized. Here, you must ensure that all references are actually identified during initialization. This is not always straightforward, particularly in the case of complex object networks. To analyze memory problems and detect memory leaks, you can use Memory Inspector and the ABAP Debugger memory analysis. You can display memory consumption rankings for all dynamically managed memory objects.

Note

Note that statically managed data objects can also involve unnecessary memory consumption. For example, large flat structures with unused or initial components, whose initial values require a lot of memory space. Here, strings that only contain blanks occupy 2 bytes for each blank. The situation can become particularly critical if these structures are combined with dynamic techniques (if they are used as internal table rows, for example). Consequently, boxed components were introduced. They support initial value sharing for initial substructures, which means that the initial value of a substructure is created only once in memory. For structures with substructures that have a sparse fill level, this can reduce memory consumption and copy costs significantly.

Bad Example

In the following source code, all the data in a very large database table is imported into an internal table. Here there is an obvious risk of memory bottlenecks.

SELECT \*
       FROM very\_large\_table
       INTO TABLE ...

Good Example

In the following source code, the PACKAGE SIZE addition is used. This restricts the maximum size of the internal table to a secure level.

SELECT \*
       FROM very\_large\_table
       INTO TABLE ... PACKAGE SIZE 1000.
       ENDSELECT.

Administration Costs of Dynamic Memory Objects

Background

Dynamic memory objects provide flexibility, but this comes at a price. The administration of these objects incurs internal costs, which are reflected in increased memory consumption, and in the worst case possibly far too high.

The total memory requirements of a dynamic memory object comprise the requirements of the objects themselves and the requirements of the administration data. The administration data consists of the reference, with a fixed size of 8 bytes, and a header that contains the address of the data itself and additional administration information. The reference initially points to a header and not directly to the object. The size of the header is itself dynamic and depends on the category of memory object as follows:

-   String headers of strings whose length is less than approximately 30 characters or 60 bytes require between 10 and 40 bytes approximately, depending on the string length. For longer strings, the header requires approximately 50 bytes, regardless of the string length.

-   Table headers require approximately 150 bytes (in 32 bit architecture) or approximately 200 bytes (in 64 bit architecture).

-   Object headers of anonymous data objects and instances of classes require approximately 30 bytes, regardless of the object.

The headers are created when dynamic data objects are provided with content or when objects are created. When a dynamic data object (a string or internal table) is initialized, only the content itself is deleted, while the header is retained to be used again. Only the statement FREE deletes (some) table headers that are too big. When it deletes an object, Garbage Collector also deletes the object header.

For internal tables, in addition to the administration data (mostly independent of the number of rows) in the header, extra memory is required for each row, for example, for index or hash management. This memory is not created in the table header. Instead it is created in parallel to the table body. Depending on the table category, every table has at least one primary index (standard tables, sorted tables) or hash management (hashed tables). The costs are:

-   6 bytes on average per each table row for the primary index.

-   18 bytes per table row on average, provided that the table is not accessed using the DELETE or SORT statements. If one of these access types occurs, an average of 30 bytes is required per table row.

With each additional secondary table key, the [memory](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensecondary_key_guidl.htm "Guideline") requirement increases by the memory needed for secondary key management (secondary index or secondary hash management).

Rule

Consider the ratio of administration and application data

When using dynamically managed memory objects, it should remembered that memory is required for administration purposes, in addition to memory for the actual data. The size of the administrative memory should be relatively small compared to the application data.

Details

Memory management of dynamic memory objects is generally invisible for developers and cannot be controlled by developers. However, it is important to consider administration costs during the design and development phases, to ensure that the costs do not become disproportionately high compared to the actual data content. For internal tables, for example, the administration data consists of a part that is mainly independent of the number of rows and a part for each row. Consequently, tables with only a few rows and tables with very narrow rows are unfavorable. A sorted table of integers, for instance, always uses more memory for its administrative information than for the actual application data. Hashed tables require even more administration for each row.

In addition, the fill level of complex data objects assumes a significant role. If the application data is only stored in a small number of large memory objects, the administrative part usually does not play a role. However, if complex data objects (structures, internal tables) have a lot of deep components, care must be taken: For example, a disproportionate amount of memory space is lost for tables with a lot of relatively small strings or for nested tables containing relatively small tables. We distinguish the following three cases:

-   Complex data objects with a sparse fill level
    These data objects contain a lot of deep components and most of them are initial.

-   Complex data objects with a duplicative fill level
    These data objects contain a lot of deep components and most of them point to the same application data by means of a reference variable or sharing.

-   Complex data objects with a low fill level
    These data objects contain a lot of deep components that refer to different objects, strings, or internal tables, which only contain a small amount of application data or are empty.

Deep data objects with a fill level that is sparse or duplicative can usually be used without problems. But for complex data objects with a low fill level, a disparity between administration data and application data can easily occur. ABAP is inappropriate for large-scale use of data objects with a low fill level.

At a low dataset level, class wrapping can be considered as an alternative to internal tables. This is because the extra costs for objects are comparatively low and objects can be completely deleted from the memory (unlike dynamic data objects). This is an exception to the rule that [dynamic data objects](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenuse_dyn_data_object_guidl.htm "Guideline") should be used wherever possible.

Note

Besides the ratio of administration data to application data, the ratio of the [memory allocated](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abeninitial_memory_requ_guidl.htm "Guideline") for application data and the memory actually used is also interesting for internal tables.

Example

The executable example [DEMO\_MEMORY\_USAGE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenmemory_usage_abexa.htm) demonstrates the administration costs of deep components with low data content.

Accessing Data Objects Dynamically

Background

Field symbols and data references are used to access data objects whose name and attributes are not known until runtime.

-   Field symbols
    A field symbol is a symbolic name for a data object declared with FIELD-SYMBOLS, to which memory areas can be assigned using the ASSIGN statement or, if internal tables are processed, using the ASSIGNING addition. Field symbols are typed either generically or completely and can be used like a data object in all appropriate operand positions. For typing, the same rules apply as for [formal parameters of procedures](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentype_formal_param_guidl.htm "Guideline"). When accessing field symbols, value semantics applies, which means that the assigned memory content is addressed directly. Field symbols are thus always handled like dereferenced pointers.

-   Data references
    A data reference is the content of a data reference variable that is declared using REF TO and points to any data objects or parts of data objects. Data references are needed to create anonymous data objects using CREATE DATA or [NEW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenconstructor_expression_new.htm). They can also be generated for existing data objects, however, using the statement GET REFERENCE, the reference operator [REF](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenconstructor_expression_ref.htm), or, if internal tables are processed, using the REFERENCE INTO addition. A data reference variable is either completely generic or completely typed. When accessing data reference variables, reference semantics applies, which means that the data reference itself is addressed. To access the referenced memory content, a data reference variable must be dereferenced explicitly using the dereferencing operator (->\*).

Field symbols and data references are closely linked because only completely typed data reference variables can be dereferenced in any operand position. Completely generic data reference variables (REF TO data) can be dereferenced in the ASSIGN statement only.

Data reference variables can be [declared](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendeclaration_variables_guidl.htm "Guideline") in the same context as all other data objects, especially also as attributes of classes. Field symbols, in contrast, can only be declared within procedures ([methods](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenfunct_module_subroutine_guidl.htm "Guideline")) or in the global declaration part. However, the latter is [no longer allowed](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendeclaration_variables_guidl.htm "Guideline").

Rule

Use field symbols and data references in appropriate ways

Use field symbols and data references for the purpose that best matches their semantics:

-   Field symbols for value access (value semantics)

-   Data references for working with the references (reference semantics)

Details

Both field symbols and data references can be understood as pointers to memory areas. The main difference is in the different access semantics.

-   Due to their value semantics, field symbols should always be used if the focus is on the access to referenced data. Field symbols provide specific functions for this purpose, which are not available for data references:

-   Dynamic access to attributes of classes and objects
    ASSIGN (class\_name)=>(attr\_name) ...
    ASSIGN oref->(attr\_name) ...

-   Dynamic access to structure components
    ASSIGN ... COMPONENT ...

-   Explicit casting
    ASSIGN ... CASTING ...

-   Dereferencing of generic data reference variables
    ASSIGN dref->\* ...

-   Due to their reference semantics, data references are to be used if the focus is on the explicit handling of references to data objects. Data references are vital for creating anonymous data objects or complex dynamic data structures, such as trees or chained lists in the [internal session](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abeninternal_session_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or in the shared objects memory. Furthermore, data references are the preferred element for implementing explicit sharing between any data objects, and for passing pointers to data objects to procedures.

Note

Actually, data reference variables can be better used in programs that are based on [ABAP Objects](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenabap_obj_progr_model_guidl.htm "Guideline") because they have the same semantics as object reference variables and therefore represent a more [modern](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenmodern_abap_guidl.htm "Guideline") programming concept. Field symbols, on the other hand, provide more functions than data references and can thus not always be replaced by them. Consequently, the usage of field symbols for dynamic accesses to data objects is still recommended, although the sole use of data references would be preferred for consistency and simplicity reasons.

Bad Example

The following source code shows a loop for an internal table in which the system is supposed to directly [access the current row](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentable_output_guidl.htm "Guideline"). If a generic data reference variable is used for this purpose, a field symbol is also needed for its dereferencing.

METHOD some\_method.
  "IMPORTING i\_itab TYPE INDEX TABLE
  DATA dref TYPE REF TO data.
  FIELD-SYMBOLS <fs> TYPE data.
  ...
  LOOP AT i\_itab REFERENCE INTO dref.
    ASSIGN dref->\* TO <fs>.
    <fs> = ...
  ENDLOOP.
  ...
ENDMETHOD.

Good Example

The following source code simplifies the above example by using a field symbol, which is required to access table rows anyway, directly and without using a data reference. The direct use of the field symbol thus also complies with the [KISS principle](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenkiss_principle_guidl.htm "Guideline").

METHOD some\_method.
  "IMPORTING i\_itab TYPE INDEX TABLE
  FIELD-SYMBOLS <fs> TYPE data.
  ...
  LOOP AT i\_itab ASSIGNING <fs>.
    <fs> = ...
  ENDLOOP.
...
ENDMETHOD.

Generic Programming

Background

Generic programming (dynamic creation of source code) makes programs as dynamic as possible. The following methods can be used to achieve this:

-   Dynamic token specification
    Dynamic token specification involves specifying individual operands or whole parts of statements (clauses) in the form of character-like data objects. These are usually enclosed in parentheses and must contain source code with correct syntax at runtime. Important examples:

-   Dynamic access to attributes of classes (Dynamic Access)

-   Call procedures dynamically, especially methods (Dynamic Invoke)

-   Dynamic type specifications when anonymous data objects are created. In this case, types can be used that are only created at runtime using Runtime Type Services ([RTTS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenrtti.htm)).

-   Dynamic specifications of clauses when internal tables are accessed or in Open SQL.
    Dynamic token specifications are often used in combination with [dynamic access to data objects](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendyn_access_data_obj_guidl.htm "Guideline").

-   Program generation
    Program generation involves preparing complete programs as content for internal tables and then creating the programs. A distinction is made between the following cases:

-   Transient program generation using GENERATE SUBROUTINE POOL, where the generated programs only exist in the [internal session](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abeninternal_session_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current program.

-   Persistent program generation with INSERT REPORT. The generated programs are saved as repository objects.

Rule

Avoiding Program Generation

Program generation should only be used as a last resort for generic programming. Other dynamic methods (especially in application programs) should be tried first, such as dynamic token specification, runtime type services (RTTS) and dynamic access to data objects.

Details

Program generation has a lot of conceptual problems such as checking, testing, and editing the new programs. In addition, programs generated hastily can be a security risk because they cannot be statically checked. Creating programs is usually very intensive in terms of runtime and resources. Due to the above reasons, program generation should be avoided wherever possible and other dynamic methods used instead:

-   The dynamic token specification has the advantage that only parts of the statements are dynamic. The rest can be checked statically.

-   Runtime type services (RTTS) can be used as follows:

-   RTTS define the type attributes of data objects at runtime (Runtime Type Information, RTTI). The capabilities of RTTI extend far beyond the statement DESCRIBE FIELD.

-   It creates types at runtime (Runtime Type Creation, RTTC). RTTC should be used if the CREATE DATA statement does not offer sufficient options for the planned implementation (for example, building new structures).

These methods, combined with [field symbols and data references](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abendyn_access_data_obj_guidl.htm "Guideline"), are now usually sufficient for most tasks that could only be solved using program generation in older releases.

Exception

Program generation should only be used as a last resort if the other methods are not sufficient to achieve dynamic program control. Another reason is the processing speed. When program generation is used, the costs incurred due to checking and generation occur less frequently than with the other dynamic methods. However, program generation is usually associated with worse system performance than dynamic token specification. The conceptual problems explained at the start are still applicable here and therefore careful consideration is needed.

Unlike application programs, system programs usually frequently rely on program generation and the associated language constructs. Examples include the generation of proxy classes for Web Dynpro or Web Services. ABAP Editor itself also uses statements such as READ REPORT and INSERT REPORT.

Note

Even generated programs should always adhere to the predefined guidelines. For example, the program logic should be implemented/generated in a generated subroutine pool in the form of [local classes](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenabap_obj_progr_model_guidl.htm "Guideline"). The generated functions are usually called by means of a single [subroutine](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenfunct_module_subroutine_guidl.htm "Guideline") that is used as an entry point into the generated local classes (see the following example).

To minimize the risks involved, it can be useful to save templates with correct syntax that adhere to the guidelines in the repository. READ REPORT can then be used to load the templates as templates for dynamically generated programs, in which only small parts are changed or added at runtime.

Subroutines in generated subroutine pools are an exception to the [rule](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenabap_obj_progr_model_guidl.htm "Guideline"), which states that subroutines should no longer be created, and an exception to the [rule](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenintern_extern_proc_call_guidl.htm "Guideline"), which states that subroutines should no longer be called. In addition, absolute type names can be used to access the local classes of a generated subroutine pool. However, this violates the rule [Only call suitable procedures externally](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenintern_extern_proc_call_guidl.htm "Guideline").

Bad Example

The following source code demonstrates unnecessary program generation. The only reason for generating the program are dynamic reads on a database table. The name of the database table and the row type of the internal table (into which data is read) are replaced by a parameter value in the source code of the program to be generated. The value operator [VALUE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenconstructor_expression_value.htm) is used to create the internal table. As recommended, the subroutine of the generated subroutine pool only contains the call for a method of a local class where the actual implementation is located. Instead of filling the program table row by row, it would have also been possible in this case to create a corresponding program in the repository and load this program using READ REPORT.

PARAMETERS dbtab TYPE c LENGTH 16.

DATA table TYPE REF TO data.
FIELD-SYMBOLS <table> TYPE STANDARD TABLE.

DATA: source TYPE TABLE OF string,
      program TYPE string,
      mess TYPE string.

source = VALUE #(

  ( \`class main definition.\` )
  ( \`   public section.\` )
  ( \`     class-data\` )
  ( \`       dyn\_table type standard table of dyn\_name.\` )
  ( \`     class-methods meth\` )
  ( \`       exporting table type ref to data.\` )

  ( \`            into table @dyn\_table.\` )
  ( \`     get reference of dyn\_table into table.\` )
  ( \`   endmethod.\` )
  ( \`endclass.\` )
  ( \`form subr changing table type ref to data.\` )
  ( \`   main=>meth(\` )

  ( \`endform.\` ) ).

   PERFORM subr IN PROGRAM (program) CHANGING table.
   IF table IS BOUND.
     ASSIGN table->\* TO <table>.
   ENDIF.
ELSE.
   ...

ENDIF.

Good Example

The following source code produces the same result as the example above, when executed successfully. In other words, the field symbol <table> points to an internal table that is filled with data from the dynamically specified database table. However, this task is performed much more efficiently in the example below due to the creation of an anonymous data object and a dynamically specified token. If the target table cannot be structured in exactly the same way as the database table, Runtime Type Creation (RTTC) must also be used.

PARAMETERS dbtab TYPE c LENGTH 20.
DATA table TYPE REF TO data.
FIELD-SYMBOLS <table> TYPE STANDARD TABLE.

TRY.
   CREATE DATA table TYPE TABLE OF (dbtab).
   ASSIGN table->\* TO <table>.
   SELECT \*
         FROM (dbtab)
         INTO TABLE @<table>.
  CATCH cx\_sy\_create\_data\_error cx\_sy\_dynamic\_osql\_error.
  ...
ENDTRY.

Internationalization

Business software used by internationally operating enterprises has to meet certain localization requirements, for example by providing different logon languages or by meeting different legal requirements. In the SAP environment, the language aspect is known as internationalization and is part of the Globalization [product standard](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencorrectness_quality_guidl.htm "Guideline"). As a consequence, translatable text sources must be used when developing in ABAP, and the technical requirements for handling variable character sets must be respected.

Storing System Texts

Background

In ABAP programs, texts are used as parts of processed data but also as a means to communicate with the user. The latter are called system texts, which are delivered with an ABAP application. The ABAP Workbench manages system texts in such a way that they can be translated from the [original language](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenoriginal_langu_guidl.htm "Guideline") into other languages independently of the actual development object. The following are examples of translatable system texts:

-   Texts and documentation of data elements in the ABAP Dictionary

-   Short texts and documentation of the components of local classes

-   UI texts of dynpros, in Web Dynpro applications and in menu entries

-   Message texts

-   Text pools of ABAP programs that include the text elements of the program, for example, text symbols

-   Texts of the Online Text Repository (OTR)

In addition to translatable system texts, an ABAP program can also contain untranslatable texts. These are usually the [character literals](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenliterals_guidl.htm "Guideline") and the [comments](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abencomments_guidl.htm "Guideline") that are stored as a part of the source code.

Rule

Send only translatable system texts to the user

Specify all texts that a program uses to communicate with the user as translatable system texts. When translatable system texts are created, there must be enough space for translations.

Details

This rule is not only critical when programs are used in an international environment; it applies when working in [multilingual development groups](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenoriginal_langu_guidl.htm "Guideline") too. The prohibition of the use of character literals in the ABAP source code for all texts that are relevant for user dialogs is derived from this rule. Character literals cannot be translated. Their content is independent of the respective logon language. Instead of character literals, [text symbols](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentext_symbol_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") should be used or character literals associated with text symbols. This is also checked in the [extended program check](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenextended_program_check_guidl.htm "Guideline").

When system texts are created, there must be enough space. It is not usually possible to change the text length during translation, so the translator relies on there being sufficient space for a reasonable translation defined at the development stage. This aspect is very important for longer texts, particularly if the original language is English, because facts can normally be expressed in fewer words in English than in other languages. The opposite can be true for short texts, for example, “Feld” (German) and “field” (English), or for compound words that are written as two or more words in English.

Exception

For purely technical texts (such as HTML tags or regular expressions) that are not to be translated, character literals or literal content of character string templates can be used. These should be marked as not relevant for translation for the extended program check using pragmas.

Good Example

The following source code shows how to handle translation-relevant and non-translation-relevant text elements in source code: Technical texts that are not relevant for translation are specified as character literals. Other texts are associated with a text symbol. If the additions of the CONCATENATE statement do not play any role (for example, SEPARATED BY), it is preferable to use the chaining operator &&, as shown here, since this makes the source code clearer.

html\_line = '<title>' && 'Some Title'(ttl) && '</title>'.
APPEND html\_line TO html\_body.
...

Translation-Friendly Message Texts

Background

Message texts are translatable [system texts](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensystem_text_guidl.htm "Guideline"). You can use placeholders in the short and long texts of messages. Placeholders in short texts can either be defined uniquely in the form &i, where i can be a digit between 1 and 4, or anonymously with &.

When the message is display using the statement MESSAGE, you can use the addition WITH dobj1 ... dobj4, which replaces the placeholders &1 to &4 and & of the short text with the content of data objects dobj1, ..., and dobj4. The content of the first data object replaces the placeholder &1 and the first &, the content of the second replaces &2 and the second &, and so on. In addition, the content of the data objects dobj1, ..., dobj4 is assigned in order to the system fields sy-msgv1 to symsgv4.

Rule

Do not use anonymous placeholders (&) in message texts

Create placeholders in message texts with the unique names &1, &2, &3, and &4 only.

Details

As the syntax in the various languages differs, a translator may need to change the order of the replacement texts when translating message texts. However, the translator can adapt the order of replacement texts only if the different placeholders in a message text each have unique names. In messages with multiple placeholders, you should therefore work with the numbered placeholders &1, &2, &3, and &4, instead of using the anonymous placeholder (&).

Note

The same applies to all other constructs in which such placeholders are possible, for example, GUI titles of classic dynpros. In cases where text in text symbols is explicitly replaced by self-defined placeholders, the placeholders in the text symbol must have unique names and must be clearly identifiable for translators as placeholders that are not supposed to be translated.

Bad Example

A bad example of a message text might look as follows:

"In Tabelle & wurde der Eintrag & nicht gefunden"

If this message text was translated to

"In table & the entry & was not found"

this would not cause any problems.

If this message text was translated to

The entry & was not found in table &

a MESSAGE statement when logged on in English would produce an incorrect text.

Good Example

The following message text corrects the bad example:

In Tabelle &1 wurde der Eintrag &2 nicht gefunden

For both translations,

In table &1 the entry &2 was not found

and

The entry &2 was not found in table &1

a MESSAGE statement when logged on in English would produce a correct text.

Text Environment

Background

The [text environment](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentext_environment_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is part of the runtime environment of an ABAP program and is made up of a text environment language, a locale, and a system code page. All programs in an [internal session](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abeninternal_session_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") have a common text environment.

By default, the text environment of an internal session is determined by the [logon language](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenlogon_language_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and can be set programmatically by the statement [SET LOCALE LANGUAGE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapset_locale.htm). The current text environment language is contained in the system field sy-langu and is returned by the method GET\_LANGUAGE of the class CL\_ABAP\_SYST.

Rule

If possible, do not switch the text environment within the code

Set the statement [SET LOCALE LANGUAGE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapset_locale.htm) in exceptional cases only, and reverse any text environment switches in good time.

Details

ABAP-coded services usually expect the text environment to be specified by the current user's logon language. The services are not designed to handle text environment switches of internal sessions within the coding.

If the text environment has to be switched for a specific service due to the following exceptions, this must be done only temporarily. This means that a switched text environment must be reset within the same program context to prevent unexpected behavior in other programs within the same internal session.

Exception

Switching the text environment within the code may be necessary in the following cases:

-   Sorting of texts not written in the logon language using [SORT ... AS TEXT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapsort_itab.htm) or [CONVERT TEXT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapconvert_text.htm)

-   For accessing external files

Bad Example

The following source code shows a text environment switch within a method, where the text environment is not reset before exiting the method. This poses the danger of continuing within the wrong text environment after returning from the method.

METHOD ...
   SET LOCALE LANGUAGE ...
   ...
ENDMETHOD.

Good Example

The following source code shows a text environment switch within a method, where the text environment is reset to its original state before exiting the method.

METHOD ...
  DATA env\_lang TYPE tcp0c-langu.
  GET LOCALE LANGUAGE env\_lang.
  SET LOCALE LANGUAGE ...
  ...
  SET LOCALE LANGUAGE env\_lang.
ENDMETHOD.

Character Set of ABAP Source Code

Background

[ABAP source code](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenabap_source_code_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is edited in the ABAP Editor tool in ABAP Workbench, itself an ABAP program. ABAP Editor saves and processes the ABAP source code internally in a data object (an internal table).

The source code is processed in the current

[text environment](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentext_environment_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the developer, using the associated code page.

Rule

Use only 7-bit ASCII characters in source code

Use only characters from the 7-bit ASCII character set in ABAP source code. This avoids problems in systems with different code pages.

Details

The 7 bit ASCII character set contains only characters that also exist in all other code pages. Restricting the characters used in source code to this character set guarantees that this code can be edited and executed regardless of the [logon language](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenlogon_language_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or [text environment language](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abentext_env_langu_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). Source code that contains characters from other character sets could, in the worst case, have incorrect syntax in a system with a different code page.

ABAP words in ABAP statements use only 7-bit ASCII characters anyway, which means that this rules to names, literals, and comments.

Note

Since the programs with the ABAP language version [Standard ABAP (Unicode)](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenunicode_program_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") are now the only possible programs, so names comply with the rule above automatically. Comments are supposed to be [written in English](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenlangu_choice_guidl.htm "Guideline") anyway, which removes the need for any country-specific special characters.

In a current system, all [ABAP source code](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenabap_source_code_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is stored in Unicode and this is why this problem does not occur there. If a guarantee could be given that a program was written only for Unicode systems, the rule above would not be needed for literals and comments (at the very least). It is not possible to ensure that a program is not used in any non-Unicode systems, which is why general robustness rules should always be followed. This ensures that programs can be transported from Unicode systems to non-Unicode systems without conversion losses.

Splitting Texts

Background

Usually the characters in a character string are displayed in a code page using a fixed number of bytes. This means that it is always known in the memory where a character begins and ends. However, in some code pages, a character can be formed from a combination of multiple separately saved characters. This applies in particular to the characters of the surrogate area of the Unicode character set, that are collectively represented in the Unicode character display [UTF-16](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenutf16_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") by two consecutive 16-bit replacement codes ([surrogate](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abensurrogates_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")). The surrogate area, for example, includes several Chinese characters that are predominantly used in Hong Kong. The ABAP programming area does not support this area. ABAP supports the subset of UTF-16 covered by [UCS-2](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abenucs2_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), in which each character occupies two bytes. One character in the surrogate area occupies four bytes and is handled as two characters by ABAP.

Rule

Only split texts between characters

Make sure that statements do not split character strings in any places with composite characters or surrogates.

Details

Operations that split character strings include:

-   Substring accesses with offsets/lengths or substring functions

-   The SPLIT statement

-   Every assignment to a character-like field that is too short, where one side of the original value is cut off

If texts containing combined characters or surrogates are split, this can produce undefined characters that cannot be displayed. If there is a risk of this occurring, you can define a suitable separation position by using the method SPLIT\_STRING\_AT\_POSITION of classCL\_SCP\_LINEBREAK\_UTIL.

Code Pages for Files

Background

When you open text files on the application server using the OPEN DATASET statement, you specify the following options that are very important for internationalization:

-   The ENCODING addition specifies the character representation where the content of the file is handled.

-   The WITH BYTE-ORDER MARK addition, which is only possible for UTF-8 files, specifies that a byte order mark (BOM) is inserted at the beginning of a text file when it is written.

If the code page is not specified explicitly when a file is written, it is set implicitly (to UTF-8 in a Unicode system). If nothing is specified, a BOM is not set.

Rule

Write text files in UTF-8 and with a byte order mark.

Open text files for output explicitly in the UTF-8 code page. The byte order mark should be inserted and taken into account when the file is read.

Details

When a file is read, the code page used is usually very difficult to identify. However, if the byte-order mark is inserted, a file is clearly defined as a UTF-8. Therefore, you should always specify the ENCODING UTF-8 WITH BYTE-ORDER MARK additions when opening a text output file with the OPEN DATASET statement. When a text file of this type is read, it should only be opened with the SKIPPING BYTE-ORDER MARK addition, so that the byte order mark is automatically skipped and does not appear in the read application data.

Exception

Files used for data exchange with applications that do not support UTF-8 format must be output in a suitable code page.

Bad Example

The following source code shows how a text file is opened for writes without explicitly specifying the code page. In Unicode systems, UTF-8 is selected implicitly, but a byte order mark is not inserted.

OPEN DATASET dset
  FOR OUTPUT IN TEXT MODE
  ENCODING DEFAULT.

Good Example

The following source code shows how a text file is opened for writes by explicitly specifying the UTF-8 code page and using the byte order mark.

OPEN DATASET dset
  FOR OUTPUT IN TEXT MODE
  ENCODING UTF-8 WITH BYTE-ORDER MARK.
