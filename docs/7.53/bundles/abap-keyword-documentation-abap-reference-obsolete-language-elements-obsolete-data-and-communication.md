CALL FUNCTION - IN BACKGROUND TASK

[Quick Reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abapcall_function_shortref.htm)

Obsolete Syntax

CALL FUNCTION func IN BACKGROUND TASK
                   *\[*AS SEPARATE UNIT*\]*
                   *\[*DESTINATION dest*\]*
                   [parameter\_list](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abapcall_function_background_para.htm).

Addition:

[... AS SEPARATE UNIT](#!ABAP_ONE_ADD@1@)

Effect

Transactional call (tRFC) of a [remote-enabled function module](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abenremote_enabled_fm_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") specified in func using the [RFC interface](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abenrfc_interface_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). Using the addition DESTINATION, a unique [destination](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abenrfc_destination.htm) can be specified in dest. If the destination is not specified, the destination "NONE" is used implicitly. func and dest expect character-like data objects.

The transactional call registers the name of the called function, together with the destination and the actual parameters passed in [parameter\_list](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abapcall_function_background_para.htm) for the current [SAP LUW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abensap_luw_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in the database tables ARFCSSTATE and ARFCSDATA of the current [AS ABAP](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abensap_nw_abap_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") under a unique transaction ID (abbreviated as TID, stored in a structure of type ARFCTID from ABAP Dictionary, viewed using transaction SM58). After registration, the calling program is continued after the statement CALL FUNCTION.

When the [COMMIT WORK](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abapcommit.htm) statement is executed, the function modules registered for the current SAP LUW are started in the order in which they were registered. The statement [ROLLBACK WORK](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abaprollback.htm) deletes all previous registrations for the current SAP LUW.

If the specified destination is not available when COMMIT WORK is executed, an [executable program](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abenexecutable_program_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") called RSARFCSE is started in [background processing](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abenbackround_processing_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). By default, this tries to start the function modules registered for a SAP LUW in their destination every 15 minutes and up to 30 times. Changes can be made to these parameters using transaction SM59. If the destination does not become available within the defined time, it is recorded in the database table ARFCSDATA as the entry "CPICERR". By default, this entry in database table ARFCSSTATE is deleted after eight days.

Note

[background RFC (bgRFC)](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abenbg_remote_function_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") executed with the statement [CALL FUNCTION IN BACKGROUND UNIT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abapcall_function_background_unit.htm) is the enhanced successor technology of transactional RFC (tRFC) and makes this technology obsolete. It is strongly recommended to use bgRFC instead of tRFC.

More Information

More information about tRFC can be found in the RFC documentation on [SAP Help Portal](http://help.sap.com).

Addition

... AS SEPARATE UNIT

Effect

When using the addition AS SEPARATE UNIT, the relevant function module is executed in a separate [RFC session](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abenrfc_session_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), in which the global data of the function group is not influenced by previous calls. Each function module that is registered with the addition AS SEPARATE UNIT is given a separate transaction ID. Without the addition AS SEPARATE UNIT, the usual [description](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abenrfc_context.htm) applies to the [RFC session](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abenrfc_session_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the called function modules. This means that, when using the same [RFC destination](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abendestination_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") for multiple calls of function modules belonging to the same function group, the global data of this function group is accessed collectively.

Notes

-   The function module ID\_OF\_BACKGROUNDTASK can be used after a transactional RFC to determine the transactional ID (TID) of the current [SAP LUW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abensap_luw_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
    
-   The transactional RFC (tRFC) is suitable for realizing LUWs in distributed environments (a typical application is ALE). Note that, although the execution of the function modules within a transaction ID is specified, the order of the [LUWs](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abenluw_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") on the RFC servers is not necessarily the same as the order of the SAP LUWs on the RFC client. To ensure the same serialization is also used on RFC servers, the tRFC can be enhanced as ([queued RFC (qRFC)](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abenqrfc_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")). For this, the function module TRFC\_SET\_QUEUE\_NAME can be called before a transactional RFC. More information about qRFC can be found in the RFC documentation on [SAP Help Portal](http://help.sap.com).
    
-   If [tRFC](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abentrfc_2_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or [qRFC](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abenqrfc_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") are registered in a [dialog module](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abendialog_module_object_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and are not started with COMMIT WORK, they are not executed by the COMMIT WORK of the caller.
    
-   The new variant [CALL FUNCTION IN BACKGROUND UNIT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abapcall_function_background_unit.htm) ([bgRFC](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abenbgrfc_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")) includes and enhances the existing tRFC and qRFC variants. For this reason, we strongly recommend using bgRFC instead of tRFC.
    
-   The statements [COMMIT WORK](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abapcommit.htm) and [ROLLBACK WORK](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abaprollback.htm) must not be executed within a LUW. In addition, no implicit [database commit](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abendatabase_commit_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") can be triggered there.
    
-   When handling the registration entries in the database tables ARFCSSTATE and ARFCSDATA, note that they are subject to the regular administration rules for a [database LUW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abendatabase_luw_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). For example, the database LUW is ended by a [database rollback](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abendatabase_rollback_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), all registration entries of the current database LUW are deleted.

Obsolete Syntax

... OBJECTS *{*o1 = e1 o2 = e2 ...*}**|*(otab) ...

Effect

This addition of the statement [CALL TRANSFORMATION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abapcall_transformation.htm) can be used to pass object references e1 e2 ... to an XSL transformation as external objects o1 o2 ... to call their methods here.

Instead of using a static parameter list, the objects can be passed dynamically as value pairs in the columns of the internal table otab with the type ABAP\_TRANS\_OBJBIND\_TAB from the [type group](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abentype_group_1_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") ABAP.

Note

The addition OBJECTS is obsolete. External objects are handled like parameters and object references must be passed accordingly with the addition [PARAMETERS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abapcall_transformation.htm).

COMMUNICATION

[Quick Reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abapcommunication_shortref.htm)

Obsolete Syntax

COMMUNICATION [comstep](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abapcommunication_comstep.htm) ID id *\[* [cpic\_options](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abapcommunication_options.htm)*\]*.

Effect

This statement enables cross-system communication between two ABAP programs, or between an ABAP program and a program written in another programming language. The whole communication process takes place in individual communication steps, which involve repeated execution of the statement COMMUNICATION with the corresponding additions [comstep](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abapcommunication_comstep.htm). For both partner programs, communication is based on the [CPI-C](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abencpi-c_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") interface, which has been defined as a communication standard by IBM as a part of the SAA standard. This interface provides the following functions in the form of the CPI-C starter set:

-   Creating, accepting, and closing a connection
    
-   Sending and receiving data
    

Coordination of the individual communication steps, recording any errors that occur in the database table TCPIC and, if necessary, data conversion, take place in the individual programs themselves. The parameters that determined the physical partner system for a connection are administrated in the database table TXCOM.

Once the connection is initialized, the system writes an eight-digit connection number in the data object id. This number can be used to identify individual connections. As standard, 2\*\*16 connections are possible for each calling program. id expects only [flat](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abenflat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") character-like data types, with a minimum length of eight digits.

After initialization, the connection must be created. Then, in the first connection step, all the necessary administration data is sent to the partner system. The data sent in this connection step must have a specific structure and must be available in an [EBCDIC](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abenebcdic_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") format. The example below shows how a specifically formed structure can be converted into the EBCDIC format. The subsequent response also exists in EBCDIC format. After this initial connection has been established, data can be transferred without the need for further conversion.

In communications, the [internal session](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abeninternal_session_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in the called program must not be changed. Screen output is ignored or, in the case of list output to the SAP spool system, is diverted if the statement NEW-PAGE is entered beforehand. [Messages](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abenmessage_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of types I, S, and W are ignored, while types A and E cause the program to terminate.

Notes

-   The statement COMMUNICATION is not supported in classes and should not appear in programs anymore, since support for the direct programming of the CPI-C interface has largely been discontinued. Instead, only the [RFC interface](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abenrfc_interface_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is to be used for communication between programs. However, the function of the statement is maintained for supporting existing programs and for internal purposes.
    
-   The EBCDIC format is used in the first connection step because the CPI-C interface was mainly used for connections to R/2 systems.
    

Example

In the simplest case, an ABAP program calls a subroutine in an ABAP program of another [AS ABAP](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abensap_nw_abap_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). To enable this, the calling program must register on the other system by specifying the type of CPI-C service, the logon data, the programs and subroutines, and the type of error handling. The registration is performed by sending a specific structure to the other system in EBCDIC format.

The following example shows a schematic representation of the communication between two ABAP programs P1 and P2 without querying return values. The calling program P1 first creates the connection and sends a field connect\_xstr that contains the content of the connect structure converted into EBCDIC format, with the necessary data. After the connection is confirmed by P2, P1 sends the actual, unconverted application data in the buffer b. When this data has been received, P2 sends a confirmation to P1. The connection from P1 is then closed again and the content of the buffer ("Answer") is produced as output.

[5\. ... RECEIVE BUFFER buf DATAINFO dat STATUSINFO stat](#!ABAP_ALTERNATIVE_5@5@)
[6\. ... DEALLOCATE](#!ABAP_ALTERNATIVE_6@6@)

Effect

There are different alternatives for specifying comstep, each of which is responsible for a connection step.

Alternative 1

... INIT DESTINATION  dest

Effect

The connection between the programs initialized by specifying dest. dest expects a [flat](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abenflat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") character-like data object of the length 8 and, when executing the statement, the data object contains a value from the column SDEST of the database table TXCOM.

On initialization, the system automatically executes an authorization check on the [authorization object](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abenauthorization_object_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") S\_CPIC. The authorization can be checked before the connection is established using the function module AUTHORITY\_CHECK\_CPIC.

Alternative 2

... ALLOCATE

Effect

Establishes a connection to the partner identified in the previous addition DESTINATION. At the same time, a start request is passed to the partner, if it is a program.

Alternative 3

... ACCEPT

Effect

This addition can be used to accept the established connection in a called partner program. After authentication, the called program is in receive status.

Alternative 4

... SEND BUFFER buf

Effect

Sends data to the partner program. A data object can be specified for buf, for which all [flat](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abenflat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") elementary types are permitted and the memory requirement of 32000 bytes cannot be exceeded. If the statement COMMUNICATION is executed, the content of buf is passed to the partner program.

Notes

-   A connection step opened with SEND must be followed by a connection step opened with RECEIVE.
    
-   Information loss, for example as a result of different number formats between the communication partners, is avoided if only character-like types are used for transferring the data. Furthermore, the data is only transferred completely if the sending and receiving buffers have the same structure and length.
    

Alternative 5

... RECEIVE BUFFER buf DATAINFO dat STATUSINFO stat

Effect

Receives data from the partner program. A data object can be specified for buf, for which all flat elementary types are permitted and the memory requirement of 32000 bytes cannot be exceeded. On execution of the statement COMMUNICATION, the content of buf is received by the partner program.

After the execution of the statement, the data object dat contains information about whether the data is sent completely and the content of the data object stat indicates whether the current program is in send or receive mode. Only byte-like data objects are allowed for dat and stat, the length should not be less than 4 bytes. The encoding for the values in dat and stat can be extracted from the [include program](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abeninclude_program_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") RSCPICDF. Here, data objects with a descriptive name and [start values](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abenstart_value_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") are declared which can be compared with dat and stat.

Note

A connection step opened with RECEIVE must be followed by a connection step opened with SEND.

Alternative 6

... DEALLOCATE

Effect

The connection is terminated and all memory areas are released.

Addition 2

... LENGTH leng

Effect

This addition can only be specified in the communication steps SEND and RECEIVE. As a result, the data buffer buffer is only sent or received in the length leng. The length leng expects a data object of the data type i.

Addition 3

... RECEIVED rec

Effect

This addition can only be specified for the communication step RECEIVE. The data object rec contains the number of bytes received by the partner program. Only byte-like data objects of length 4 are allowed for rec.

Addition 4

... HOLD

Effect

This addition can only be specified for the communication step RECEIVE. It prevents the [internal session](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abeninternal_session_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") being changed when receiving data to avoid the possible loss of the [database cursor](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abendatabase_cursor_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). In this case, the current work process waits until all data has been received.

COMMUNICATION

[Quick Reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abapcommunication_shortref.htm)

Obsolete Syntax

COMMUNICATION [comstep](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abapcommunication_comstep.htm) ID id *\[* [cpic\_options](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abapcommunication_options.htm)*\]*.

Effect

This statement enables cross-system communication between two ABAP programs, or between an ABAP program and a program written in another programming language. The whole communication process takes place in individual communication steps, which involve repeated execution of the statement COMMUNICATION with the corresponding additions [comstep](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abapcommunication_comstep.htm). For both partner programs, communication is based on the [CPI-C](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abencpi-c_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") interface, which has been defined as a communication standard by IBM as a part of the SAA standard. This interface provides the following functions in the form of the CPI-C starter set:

-   Creating, accepting, and closing a connection
    
-   Sending and receiving data
    

Coordination of the individual communication steps, recording any errors that occur in the database table TCPIC and, if necessary, data conversion, take place in the individual programs themselves. The parameters that determined the physical partner system for a connection are administrated in the database table TXCOM.

Once the connection is initialized, the system writes an eight-digit connection number in the data object id. This number can be used to identify individual connections. As standard, 2\*\*16 connections are possible for each calling program. id expects only [flat](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abenflat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") character-like data types, with a minimum length of eight digits.

After initialization, the connection must be created. Then, in the first connection step, all the necessary administration data is sent to the partner system. The data sent in this connection step must have a specific structure and must be available in an [EBCDIC](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abenebcdic_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") format. The example below shows how a specifically formed structure can be converted into the EBCDIC format. The subsequent response also exists in EBCDIC format. After this initial connection has been established, data can be transferred without the need for further conversion.

In communications, the [internal session](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abeninternal_session_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in the called program must not be changed. Screen output is ignored or, in the case of list output to the SAP spool system, is diverted if the statement NEW-PAGE is entered beforehand. [Messages](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abenmessage_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of types I, S, and W are ignored, while types A and E cause the program to terminate.

Notes

-   The statement COMMUNICATION is not supported in classes and should not appear in programs anymore, since support for the direct programming of the CPI-C interface has largely been discontinued. Instead, only the [RFC interface](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abenrfc_interface_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is to be used for communication between programs. However, the function of the statement is maintained for supporting existing programs and for internal purposes.
    
-   The EBCDIC format is used in the first connection step because the CPI-C interface was mainly used for connections to R/2 systems.
    

Example

In the simplest case, an ABAP program calls a subroutine in an ABAP program of another [AS ABAP](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abensap_nw_abap_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). To enable this, the calling program must register on the other system by specifying the type of CPI-C service, the logon data, the programs and subroutines, and the type of error handling. The registration is performed by sending a specific structure to the other system in EBCDIC format.

The following example shows a schematic representation of the communication between two ABAP programs P1 and P2 without querying return values. The calling program P1 first creates the connection and sends a field connect\_xstr that contains the content of the connect structure converted into EBCDIC format, with the necessary data. After the connection is confirmed by P2, P1 sends the actual, unconverted application data in the buffer b. When this data has been received, P2 sends a confirmation to P1. The connection from P1 is then closed again and the content of the buffer ("Answer") is produced as output.

ABAP and JavaScript

In the kernel of an AS ABAP, a JavaScript (JS) Engine is integrated, in which execute JavaScript programs can be executed either in normal or in debugging mode (server-side scripting). The JavaScript (JS) Engine used supports JavaScript Version 1.5. Proxies can be used to bind script variables to data objects in ABAP programs.

The class CL\_JAVA\_SCRIPT realizes an API, which can be used in ABAP programs, for the JavaScript (JS) Engine implemented in the kernel. This class encapsulates the JavaScript C Engine API and makes methods and attributes available to the ABAP programmer to perform JavaScript programs.

Note

Support for the binding of JavaScript to ABAP is scheduled to be stopped. This means that the class CL\_JAVA\_SCRIPT can no longer be used.

Example

The program DEMO\_JAVA\_SCRIPT\_MINI\_EDITOR is an example of a minimal JavaScript editor in which JavaScript programs can be edited, executed, and tested. This program was created using ABAP methods only and uses the class CL\_JAVA\_SCRIPT.
