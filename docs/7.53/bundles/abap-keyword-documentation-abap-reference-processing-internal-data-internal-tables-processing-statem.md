Effect

[Table iteration](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abentable_iteration_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") across multiple tables as specified by interval boundaries. The statements PROVIDE and ENDPROVIDE define a loop around a statement block. Any number of internal tables itab1 itab2 ... are edited together in this loop. A single table can appear more than once. A FIELDS addition must be specified for each table itab. After FIELDS, either the character \* must be specified for all components or a list comp1 comp2 ... must be specified for certain components of the table in question. The names of the components comp1 comp2 ... can only be specified directly.

To be able to process internal tables using PROVIDE, all tables itab1 itab2 ... must be fully typed index tables and contain two special columns that have the same data type (d, i, n, or t) for all relevant tables. For every table, the names intliml1 intliml2 ... and intlimu1 intlimu2 ... of these columns must be specified using the addition BOUNDS.

The columns intliml1 intliml2 ... and intlimu1 intlimu2 ... in every row of the relevant internal tables must contain values that can be interpreted as limits of closed intervals. Within a table, the intervals specified in these columns must not overlap and must be sorted in ascending order by the [primary table index](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abenprimary_table_index_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The intervals therefore make up a unique key for every row.

For every table, a work area wa1 wa2 ... compatible with the row type and a variable flag1 flag2 ... (which expects a character-like data type with length 1) must be specified. In the PROVIDE loop, the components specified after FIELDS are filled with values in the relevant work areas wa1 wa2 ... for every specified internal table. The variables flag1 flag2 ... are also filled. A work area wa1 wa2 ... or a variable flag1 flag2 ... cannot be specified more than once.

The BETWEEN addition must be used to specify an interval extliml, extlimu. It must be possible to convert the data objects extliml and extlimu into the data types of the respective columns intliml1 intliml2 ... and intlimu1 intlimu2 ... of the individual tables.

The interval limits intliml1 intliml2 ... and intlimu1 intlim2 for every row of all relevant internal tables itab1 itab2 ... that are within the closed interval made up by extliml and extlimu divide the latter into new intervals and every interval limit closes one interval in the original direction. If, within a relevant table, a lower interval limit follows an upper interval limit with no space or gap between them and the components of the corresponding rows specified after FIELDS have the same content, the two intervals are combined and the corresponding interval limits intliml1 intliml2 ... and intlimu1 intlimu2 ... are ignored for the new intervals.

For every interval that is created in such a way and overlaps with at least one of the intervals of a table involved, the PROVIDE loop is passed once. The components of every work area wa1 wa2 ... specified after FIELDS and the variables flag1 flag2 ... are filled with values as follows:

-   The components intliml1 intliml2 ... and intlimu1 intlimu2 ... of every work area wa1 wa2 ... are filled with the interval limits of the current interval.
    
-   If the current interval overlaps with one of the intervals of an involved table, the remaining components of the corresponding work area are assigned the contents of the relevant components of this table row and the variable flag1 flag2 ... is set to the value "X". Otherwise, the work area components and the variables flag1 flag2 ... are set to their [Initial value](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abeninitial_value_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). For performance reasons, the components of the work areas are provided with values again only if the corresponding content of the table rows has been modified since the preceding loop.
    

Except for intliml1 intliml2 ... and intlimu1 intlimu2 ..., the components not specified after FIELDS are always set to their initial value. The components intliml1 intliml2 ... and intlimu1 intlimu2 ... are always assigned.

The [ABAP runtime environment](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abenabap_runtime_envir_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") checks for every table involved, whether the condition of sorted and non-overlapping intervals is met within the interval made up by extliml and extlimu and, if necessary, raises a handleable exception.

Notes

-   The statement PROVIDE is intended mainly for the editing of internal tables for HR- [info types](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abeninfo_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") declared using the special statement [INFOTYPES](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abapinfotypes.htm) or that have a corresponding layout.
    
-   The relevant internal tables should not be modified in the PROVIDE loop.
    
-   Only reads should be performed on the work areas wa1 wa2 ... as well, since they are not necessarily filled again at the start of each loop.
    
-   The WHERE condition can be used to remove overlaps between the tables involved, or to ensure the sorting of the intervals.
    
-   Any [secondary table keys](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abensecondary_table_key_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the internal tables involved are not supported in the PROVIDE statement. The primary table index is always (implicitly) used for processing.
    
-   Besides this variant of the PROVIDE statement, an[obsolete short form](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abapprovide_obsolete.htm) can also be used outside of classes.
    

Addition 1

... WHERE log\_exp

Effect

The addition WHERE can be used to specify a condition for every table itab1 itab2 ... involved. After WHERE, any [logical expression](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abenlogical_expression_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [log\_exp1](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abenlogexp.htm), [log\_exp2](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abenlogexp.htm) ... can be specified. Here, a [component](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abenitab_components.htm) of the internal table must be specified as the first operand of each [relational expression](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abenrelational_expression_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") (and this component must be the only operand and not part of an expression). Only components that are also specified after FIELDS can be specified. Any [comparison expression](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abenlogexp_comp.htm) and the [predicate expression](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abenpredicate_expression_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [IS INITIAL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abenlogexp_initial.htm) can be specified as relational expressions. No other [predicates](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abenpredicate.htm) can be specified. The other operands of a comparison can be any [suitable](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abenlogexp_rules.htm) individual operands or arithmetic expressions but not components of the internal table. The table entries for which the condition is not met are ignored by the PROVIDE loop. The PROVIDE loop can be exited using the instructions in the section [Exiting Loops](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abenleave_loops.htm).

Addition 2

... INCLUDING GAPS

Effect

If the INCLUDING GAPS addition is specified, the system passes the PROVIDE loop for every interval, which is also the case when the current interval does not overlap with at least one of the intervals of an involved table. In the latter case, the variable flag is of initial value for every relevant table.

System Fields
sy-subrc and sy-tabix are set to the value 0 before every loop pass and in ENDPROVIDE. Only if the loop is not passed at all, is sy-subrc set to 4 in ENDPROVIDE.

Example

In two tables, itab1 and itab2, the respective columns col1 and col2 are interval limits of type i. The filling of the internal tables produces the following intervals (rows two and three):

\-------------------------------------------
|01|02|03|04|05|06|07|08|09|10|11|12|13|14|
\-------------------------------------------
|   Itab1 Int1    |     |Itab1 Int2 |     |
\-------------------------------------------
|        |      Itab2 Int1       |        |
\-------------------------------------------
|  |          ... BETWEEN ...             |
\-------------------------------------------
|  | i1  |   i2   | i3  |   i4   |i5|     |
\-------------------------------------------

The interval specified in the BETWEEN addition of the PROVIDE statement is shown in the fourth row. It produces the five intervals in the fifth row represented by i1 to i5. These can be processed in the PROVIDE loop.

Because each of the five intervals overlaps with one of the intervals from rows two and three, the PROVIDE loop is passed five times.

Only the component col3 of wa1 is filled in the first pass, only the component col3 of wa2 in the third pass, and the components col3 of both work areas in the second and fourth passes. The fields valid1 and valid2 are set accordingly.

DATA: BEGIN OF wa1,
        col1 TYPE i,
        col2 TYPE i,
        col3 TYPE string,
      END OF wa1.
DATA: BEGIN OF wa2,
        col1 TYPE i,
        col2 TYPE i,
        col3 TYPE string,
      END OF wa2.
DATA: itab1 LIKE STANDARD TABLE OF wa1,
      itab2 LIKE STANDARD TABLE OF wa2.
DATA: flag1(1) TYPE c,
      flag2(1) TYPE c.
itab1 = VALUE #( ( col1 = 1 col2 = 6  col3 = 'Itab1 Int1' )
                 ( col1 = 9 col2 = 12 col3 = 'Itab1 Int2' ) ).
itab2 = VALUE #( ( col1 = 4 col2 = 11 col3 = 'Itab2 Int1' ) ).
DATA output TYPE TABLE OF string WITH EMPTY KEY.
PROVIDE FIELDS col3 FROM itab1 INTO wa1
                               VALID flag1
                               BOUNDS col1 AND col2
        FIELDS col3 FROM itab2 INTO wa2
                               VALID flag2
                               BOUNDS col1 AND col2
        BETWEEN 2 AND 14.
  APPEND | { wa1-col1 WIDTH = 2 } { wa1-col2 WIDTH = 2 } {
             wa1-col3 } { flag1 } | TO output.
  APPEND | { wa2-col1 WIDTH = 2 } { wa2-col2 WIDTH = 2 } {
             wa2-col3 } { flag2 } | TO output.
  APPEND INITIAL LINE TO output.
ENDPROVIDE.
cl\_demo\_output=>display( output ).

The output is as follows:

   2           3  Itab1 Int1 X
   2           3
   4           6  Itab1 Int1 X
   4           6  Itab2 Int1 X
   7           8
   7           8  Itab2 Int1 X
   9          11  Itab1 Int2 X
   9           11  Itab2 Int1 X
  12          12  Itab1 Int2 X
  12          12

The PROVIDE loop can be exited using the instructions in the section [Exiting Loops](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abenleave_loops.htm).

Addition 2

... INCLUDING GAPS

Effect

If the INCLUDING GAPS addition is specified, the system passes the PROVIDE loop for every interval, which is also the case when the current interval does not overlap with at least one of the intervals of an involved table. In the latter case, the variable flag is of initial value for every relevant table.

System Fields
sy-subrc and sy-tabix are set to the value 0 before every loop pass and in ENDPROVIDE. Only if the loop is not passed at all, is sy-subrc set to 4 in ENDPROVIDE.

Example

In two tables, itab1 and itab2, the respective columns col1 and col2 are interval limits of type i. The filling of the internal tables produces the following intervals (rows two and three):

\-------------------------------------------
|01|02|03|04|05|06|07|08|09|10|11|12|13|14|
\-------------------------------------------
|   Itab1 Int1    |     |Itab1 Int2 |     |
\-------------------------------------------
|        |      Itab2 Int1       |        |
\-------------------------------------------
|  |          ... BETWEEN ...             |
\-------------------------------------------
|  | i1  |   i2   | i3  |   i4   |i5|     |
\-------------------------------------------

The interval specified in the BETWEEN addition of the PROVIDE statement is shown in the fourth row. It produces the five intervals in the fifth row represented by i1 to i5. These can be processed in the PROVIDE loop.

Because each of the five intervals overlaps with one of the intervals from rows two and three, the PROVIDE loop is passed five times.

Only the component col3 of wa1 is filled in the first pass, only the component col3 of wa2 in the third pass, and the components col3 of both work areas in the second and fourth passes. The fields valid1 and valid2 are set accordingly.

DATA: BEGIN OF wa1,
        col1 TYPE i,
        col2 TYPE i,
        col3 TYPE string,
      END OF wa1.
DATA: BEGIN OF wa2,
        col1 TYPE i,
        col2 TYPE i,
        col3 TYPE string,
      END OF wa2.
DATA: itab1 LIKE STANDARD TABLE OF wa1,
      itab2 LIKE STANDARD TABLE OF wa2.
DATA: flag1(1) TYPE c,
      flag2(1) TYPE c.
itab1 = VALUE #( ( col1 = 1 col2 = 6  col3 = 'Itab1 Int1' )
                 ( col1 = 9 col2 = 12 col3 = 'Itab1 Int2' ) ).
itab2 = VALUE #( ( col1 = 4 col2 = 11 col3 = 'Itab2 Int1' ) ).
DATA output TYPE TABLE OF string WITH EMPTY KEY.
PROVIDE FIELDS col3 FROM itab1 INTO wa1
                               VALID flag1
                               BOUNDS col1 AND col2
        FIELDS col3 FROM itab2 INTO wa2
                               VALID flag2
                               BOUNDS col1 AND col2
        BETWEEN 2 AND 14.
  APPEND | { wa1-col1 WIDTH = 2 } { wa1-col2 WIDTH = 2 } {
             wa1-col3 } { flag1 } | TO output.
  APPEND | { wa2-col1 WIDTH = 2 } { wa2-col2 WIDTH = 2 } {
             wa2-col3 } { flag2 } | TO output.
  APPEND INITIAL LINE TO output.
ENDPROVIDE.
cl\_demo\_output=>display( output ).

The output is as follows:

   2           3  Itab1 Int1 X
   2           3
   4           6  Itab1 Int1 X
   4           6  Itab2 Int1 X
