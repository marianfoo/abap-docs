AS Instance for short. Component of an [AS ABAP](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abensap_nw_abap_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). An AS ABAP can be implemented using one or more AS Instances, usually instantiated on different [host computers](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). It is also possible, however, for multiple AS Instances of one or more AS ABAPs to be instanced on the same host computer. Each AS Instance uses its [work processes](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abenwork_process_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") to execute [ABAP programs](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abenabap_program_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The memory areas of an AS Instance that can be accessed in the ABAP programs are the [shared memory](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abenshared_memory_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), the [user memory](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abenuser_memory_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), the [ABAP memory](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abenabap_memory_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), and the [session memory](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abenroll_area_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in the [internal session](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abeninternal_session_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
