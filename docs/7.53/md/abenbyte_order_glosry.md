Byte Order

Determines the order in which the binary representation of the [data types](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abendata_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [i](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abenbuiltin_types_numeric.htm), [int8](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abenbuiltin_types_numeric.htm), [decfloat16](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abenbuiltin_types_numeric.htm), [decfloat34](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abenbuiltin_types_numeric.htm), [f](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abenbuiltin_types_numeric.htm), [s](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abenbuiltin_types_numeric.htm), or a character is stored in the memory. A distinction is made between [big](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abenbig_endian_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and [little endian](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abenlittle_endian_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). In the former case, the system writes the byte with the highest level, and in the second case the byte with the lowest level, to the first position in the memory.
