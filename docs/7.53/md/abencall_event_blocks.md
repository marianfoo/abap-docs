Call Event Blocks

Event blocks are processing blocks in an ABAP program that are executed when the corresponding event occurs in the [ABAP runtime environment](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abenabap_runtime_envir_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). These types of events can be raised in as program-driven events (and the event blocks where they are implemented called) in two cases:

-   Using the statement [SET USER-COMMAND](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abapset_user-command.htm) in classic list processing

-   Using the statement [PUT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abapput.htm) in logical databases

Both statements are effectively obsolete. More information about them can be found in the relevant sections.
