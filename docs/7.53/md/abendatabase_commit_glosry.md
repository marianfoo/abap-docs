database commit

End of a [database LUW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abendatabase_luw_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), in which changed data records are committed to the [database](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abendatabase_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). All changes are temporary until they have been written using a database commit. Changes are always directly visible to the executing program. The [database system](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abendatabase_system_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that is used determines whether other users can see the database changes immediately or only after the database commit. In [AS ABAP](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abensap_nw_abap_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), database commits are triggered implicitly, as well as by being requested explicitly.
