grouping set

Grouping sets are used in the [GROUP BY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abapgroupby_clause.htm) clause of a [query](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abenquery_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") to aggregate the results set of the query. Each grouping set aggregates the rows with identical content in the columns and/or the rows with the identical results in SQL expressions. The GROUP BY addition GROUPING SETS makes it possible to group multiple aggregations under one [SELECT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abapselect.htm) statement.
