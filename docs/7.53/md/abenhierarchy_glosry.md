hierarchy

Arrangement of objects joined in relationships in [hierarchy levels](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abenhierarchy_level_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). In hierarchies defined using [parent-child relationships](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abenpcr_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), the hierarchy levels are arranged linearly. Each object in a level that is not the first level has parents in the preceding level. Each object can have child objects in the following level. Parents can have more than one child object. If child objects do not have more than one parent, the hierarchy is a tree-like monohierarchy. All other cases are polyhierarchies.
