Logical Databases - Use

There are two ways of using a logical database.

-   [Associated with executable programs](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abenldb_usage_executable.htm)

-   [Called using function modules](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abenldb_usage_function.htm)

When logical databases are associated with executable programs, the selections are entered using the selection screen If called using a function module, the selection screen is not displayed. The calling program needs to provide special subroutines (callback routines) instead of interface work areas. These routines are called by the function module and filled with data.
