Expressions and Functions for Conditions

The flow control of a program is managed by [control structures](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abencontrol_structure_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that are generally controlled by logical expressions. The following options exist for the formulation and analysis of conditions:

-   [Logical expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abenlogexp.htm)

-   [Logical functions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abenlogic_functions.htm)

In addition to control structures, there are also other statements where logical expressions and functions can be specified.
