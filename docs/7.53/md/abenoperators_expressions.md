Operators and Expressions

Generally, an operator joins two operands as an [expression](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abenexpressions.htm) or constructs an expression together with an operand. When a statement containing expressions like this is executed, the result of the expression is determined (known as the operation) and used in the statement. Operators are represented either by special characters or [reserved names](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abenabap_words.htm).
