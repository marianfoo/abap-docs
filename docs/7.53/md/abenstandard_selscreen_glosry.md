standard selection screen

[Selection screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abenselection_screen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") defined outside of the statements [SELECTION-SCREEN BEGIN*|*END OF SCREEN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abapselection-screen_definition.htm). A standard selection screen has the [dynpro number](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abendynpro_number_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") 1000 and is only possible in [executable programs](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abenexecutable_program_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and [logical databases](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abenlogical_data_base_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). When an executable program is associated with a logical database, the two standard selection screens are grouped into one selection screen. When an executable program is executed with the statement [SUBMIT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abapsubmit.htm), the standard selection screen is called automatically if no other screen is specified. See also [standalone selection screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abenstand-alone_sel_screen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
