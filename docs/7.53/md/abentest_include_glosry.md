test include

Special include program used to list the [test classes](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abentest_class_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of an [ABAP program](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abenabap_program_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). With the exception of test includes for [class pools](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abenclass_pool_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and [function groups](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abenfunction_group_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), no test includes can currently be created. The associated [ABAP Workbench](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abenabap_workbench_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") tools or [ABAP Development Tools (ADT)](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abenadt_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") access the associated test include automatically. The name of the test include of a class pool ends in "CCAU" and the name of the test include of a function group ends in "T99". For other programs, the naming convention of the test include is the name of the program padded with "=" up to and including the 34th position and ending in "T".
