unit test

A unit test is created and conducted by developers to verify the functional correctness of individual software modules. A software module in this context is a significant unit of code that has a specific verifiable aim. [Procedures](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abenprocedure_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") are a typical example of this kind of unit in ABAP. Procedures are the smallest functional components of larger units such as [classes](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abenclass_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or [function groups](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abenfunction_group_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). Unit tests are used during the development and quality assurance phases to ensure that the individual components of a larger software unit function correctly. Unit tests are developed and run in [ABAP Unit](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/abenabap_unit_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
