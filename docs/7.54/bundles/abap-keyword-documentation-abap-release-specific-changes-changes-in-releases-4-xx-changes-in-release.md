Catchable Runtime Errors in Release 4.0

With Release 4.0 runtime errors can be caught with [CATCH SYSTEM-EXCEPTIONS ... ENDCATCH](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abapcatch_sys.htm).

In the past the occurrence of a runtime error always resulted in termination of the ABAP program. Special tests had to be programmed at critical locations in programs to ensure that the program would always execute without problems.
With [CATCH SYSTEM-EXCEPTIONS ... ENDCATCH](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abapcatch_sys.htm) such critical program locations can now be caught. After ENDCATCH you can query if the program block was ended correctly or if a runtime error occurred that was detected.

Bit Operations and Bit Comparisons in Release 4.0

New variants SET BIT and GET BIT

[SET BIT n of f](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abapset_bit.htm) sets the nth bit of field f.
[GET BIT n OF f INTO g](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abapget_bit.htm) puts the nth bit of field f in field g.

,,New bit operations BIT-NOT, BIT-AND, BIT-XOR and BIT-OR

In the [COMPUTE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abapcompute_bit.htm) statement, the new operators BIT-NOT, BIT-AND, BIT-XOR and BIT-OR can be used for bit operations.

You can manage complex conditions and sets efficiently with the new variants SET BIT and GET BIT and the new bit operations applied to bits strings.

Changes in Bit Comparisons

The comparison is now performed in the second operand for the [compare operators](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abenlogexp_bitmasks.htm) O, Z and M, where the operand must be of type X.
Up to Release 3.0 the comparison was performed in length 1 and the second field was considerd to be a X field, regardless of its type and length.

Data Types in ABAP Dictionary in Release 4.0

General

Until now data types were administered and defined in different ways in the ABAP programming language and in ABAP Dictionary.

In Release 3.0, many enhancements were made to the type concept in the ABAP programming language. Elementary and structured data types can now be defined independently of each other. Structured data types can be further subdivided into structures and internal tables. Structure components and row types in internal tables can have any data type, which makes it possible to define extremely complex data types. If a complex data type is split into all its component parts, the result is always the elementary ABAP data types.

ABAP data types and ABAP Dictionary data types previously only genuinely corresponded to one another if they were structures with elementary components. In ABAP Dictionary, the ABAP data type 'structure' corresponded to the structure of database tables and standalone structures. From ABAP programs, the addition LIKE could be used to reference database tables and structures in ABAP Dictionary. It was also possible to reference individual components of the dictionary types. Complex ABAP data types, however, like internal tables or non-elementary structures had no direct equivalent in the dictionary. From Release 3.0, type groups based on include technology were made available as an interim solution. These type groups allowed the user to store ABAP data types centrally in the dictionary.

Description of Functions

The following sections describe which dictionary data types correspond to individual ABAP data types and how they are addressed in ABAP:

Elementary Types

Elementary data types in ABAP correspond to the data elements that were until now only found in ABAP Dictionary. From Release 4.5A, data elements will also be called elementary types in the dictionary. For the time being, the two-tiered domain concept for elementary types retains its validity. The actual elementary dictionary data type contains the semantic attributes, while the technical attributes are defined in a domain. Elementary types and all previous dictionary data elements can be referenced directly in ABAP programs using the addition TYPE. This converts all external dictionary data types into their corresponding ABAP data types. Elementary types are the smallest indivisible units of those structured types and table types listed below. This means that all dictionary types contain semantic attributes such as texts, value tables, and documentation.

Structured Types

Structures in ABAP correspond to the structures that up to now were only found in ABAP Dictionary. From Release 4.5A, structures in the dictionary are called structured types. From Release 4.5A, individual structured type components can have any dictionary data type, so making complex structures possible. In ABAP programs, the addition TYPE can be used to reference structured types in ABAP programs. For reasons of compatibility, the LIKE reference to structured types is retained.

Table Types

From Release 4.5A, table types can be defined in ABAP Dictionary. These table types have exactly the same specification as internal tables in ABAP, including an access type, key, and row type. Any dictionary data type can be used as a row type, so making complex nested tables possible. In ABAP programs, the addition TYPE can be used to reference table types in the dictionary.

Database Tables

As well as the central administration of data types, the most important task of ABAP Dictionary is still the administration of database tables. The dictionary describes the elementary types from which the structured type of a data record in the database table is constructed. As in the past, it is still possible to use the addition LIKE in ABAP to reference the structure of database tables and of individual data fields. From 4.5A, it is also possible to use TYPE to reference the structure and fields of database tables.

Outlook

SAP plans to enable the central definition of constants in ABAP Dictionary. This is currently only possible in type groups. Also, a comprehensive bundling concept will make the encapsulation done in type groups available throughout the system.

Editing Large Datasets in Release 4.0

General

Large datasets in ABAP can be managed either as internal tables or [extract datasets](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abenextract_dataset_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Internal tables are dynamic sequential datasets whose rows all have the same structure and a key.

[Extracts](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abenextract_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") are dynamic sequential datasets whose rows can be structured differently. Extracts cannot be accessed using indexes or keys. They are always processed in a loop.

From Release 4.5A, the performance of some crucial operations on internal tables and extracts has improved significantly.

Description of Functions

New Index Management in Internal Tables

Until now, the cost of manipulating indexes increased in linear relation to the number of entries being inserted or deleted from [standard](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abenstandard_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and [sorted tables](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abensorted_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). From Release 4.5A, these index manipulation costs will only increase in logarithmic relation to the number of entries, mainly due to the fact that table indexes are now managed in tree form. This allows for more efficient insertion and deletion in very large standard and sorted tables.
[Internal Tables](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abenitab.htm)

Accessing Individual Internal Table Entries Using Field Symbols

Until now, individual entries in internal tables could only be processed indirectly using separate work areas. From Release 4.5A, field symbols can be used to display internal table entries. It is now possible to both read internal table entries and write to them as well. This allows for better performance when working with large and complex tables and makes processing nested internal tables considerably easier.

To assign a table row to a field symbol, use the following statements:
[LOOP AT itab ASSIGNING <fs>](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abaploop_at_itab.htm).
[READ TABLE itab ASSIGNING <fs>](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abapread_table.htm).

New Repository for Extracts

Until now, [extracts](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abenextract_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") were stored in SAP paging. In an effort to improve sorting and sequential processing performance, extracts of more than 500 kBytes are now stored directly in the file system.
Extracts

New External Sort Process for Internal Tables and Extracts

The main memory cannot sort large datasets all at once. Until now large datasets were sorted by the operating system's own platform-specific sort function. Now SAP's own platform-independent sort procedure is used. This reduces the costs of some sorting operations considerably.

Extracts stored in the file system are always resorted physically. Internal tables are sorted physically if they are longer than 2^19 rows or greater than 12 MB. Physical sorting reduces the costs of any follow-on sequential processing.

Extended Concept for Field Symbols in Release 4.0

The extended field symbol concept can be summarized as follows:

-   The behavior of [typed and untyped field symbols](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abapfield-symbols.htm) has been standardized.
    

-   New predicate expression [<fs> IS ASSIGNED](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abenlogexp_assigned.htm)
    

-   New statement [UNASSIGN <fs>](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abapunassign.htm)
    

Like typed field symbols, untyped field symbols are now, by default, not assigned. This means that a write access in either case (like <fs> = f.) produces a runtime error.
At the same time, read access to typed unassigned field symbols is also not possible.
Read access to untyped, unassigned field symbols is only allowed for the sake of compatibility (default value SPACE).
Unassigned field symbols, however, should no longer be accessed.

The new predicate expression [<fs> IS ASSIGNED](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abenlogexp_assigned.htm) can be used to query whether a field has already been assigned to the field symbol <fs>.

The new statement [UNASSIGN <fs>](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abapunassign.htm) sets the field symbol <fs> so that it is not pointing to a field.

The expression [IS ASSIGNED](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abenlogexp_assigned.htm), and the [ASSIGN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abapassign.htm) and [UNASSIGN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abapunassign.htm) statements enable the state of a field symbol to be established and modified at any time. This makes ABAP programs simpler and less error-prone.

Further changes:

-   Dynamic ASSIGN (ASSIGN (f) TO <fs>.):
    If <fs> is an untyped field symbol and the contents of f are invalid, ,the field symbol is not set.
    

-   ASSIGN with offset and length for VALUE parameters in FORMS and FUNCTIONS:
    A runtime error is produced if ASSIGN f+off(len) TO <fs> is used to address areas beyond the range of the VALUE parameter f.
    

-   Non-assigned field symbols in INSERT, SORT, and AT:
    If the field symbol <fs> was not yet assigned (using [ASSIGN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abapassign.htm)), it is ignored in the following statements:
    ,, [INSERT <fs> INTO fg.](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abapinsert_fg.htm)
    ,, [SORT BY <fs>.](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abapsort_extract.htm)
    ,, [SORT itab BY <fs>.](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abapsort_itab.htm)
    ,, [AT NEW <fs>.](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abapat_extract.htm)
    ,, [AT END OF <fs>.](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abapat_extract.htm)

Internal Tables and Key Tables in Release 4.0

The following features of internal tables have been improved considerably in Release 4.0:

-   Performance improvements, particularly for large tables. This has been achieved by introducing [hashed tables](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abenhashed_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), whose access time is constant, mostly regardless of the number of table entries.
    

-   Introduction of sorted tables. This has removed the need for complex program code, whose tasks are now performed in the kernel.
    

-   Support for generic programming by introducing generic table types.

The term [standard key](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abenstandard_key_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") has been expanded to include a user-defined key. In addition to the previous form of internal tables (standard tables), SAP has introduced new table types for [sorted](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abensorted_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and hashed tables. The key of these tables is an integral part of the type definition. For this reason, tables with these types are also generically known as key tables. For further information, see [internal tables](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abenitab.htm).

New Table Types: STANDARD TABLE, SORTED TABLE, and HASHED TABLE

Internal tables in their old form are now known as standard tables. The old type TABLE has now been replaced by STANDARD TABLE. The new types SORTED TABLE and HASHED TABLE have been introduced.
Sorted tables are always stored sorted by their table key in ascending order. The access time is logarithmically related to the number of table entries.
[Hashed tables](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abenhashed_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") are managed internally using a hash procedure. The access time to a single table entry is essentially constant, that is, the access time is independent of the number of entries.
This means that a complete table type is defined as follows:
1\. Table category (STANDARD TABLE, SORTED TABLE, HASHED TABLE)
2\. Row type
3\. Key (the order is part of the type definition)
4\. Uniqueness attribute (UNIQUE, NON-UNIQUE)
For further information about defining table types and objects, see the documentation for the statements [TYPES](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abaptypes_itab.htm) and [DATA](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abapdata_itab.htm).

Generic Table Types: INDEX TABLE and ANY TABLE

To allow generic programming, there is a [hierarchy](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abaptypes_tabkind.htm) based on the basic internal table types listed above. The generic type INDEX TABLE includes standard and sorted tables. The type ANY TABLE can be used for any table.
Furthermore, further generic types can be defined by omitting the row type, key, or uniqueness attribute of a table (see [TYPES](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abaptypes_itab.htm)). This enables the types of parameters to be defined in generic [procedures](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abenprocedure_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Typing of Procedure Parameters

Since the old internal table type corresponds to the new standard table, only standard tables can be passed to a TABLES parameter. The new tables types can be passed to [FORM](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abapform.htm) and [FUNCTION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abapfunction.htm) parameters using the additions USING or CHANGING or the additions IMPORTING, EXPORTING, and CHANGING.

New Table Operations

Entries in key tables are located using their key. This means that it must also be possible to add, modify, and delete table entries using the appropriate table key. The following new table operations have therefore been introduced:

-   [INSERT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abapinsert_itab.htm) ... INTO TABLE ...

-   [MODIFY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abapmodify_itab.htm) TABLE ...

-   [READ](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abapread_table.htm)   TABLE ... *\[*FROM ... *|*WITH TABLEKEY ...*\]*

-   [DELETE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abapdelete_itab.htm) TABLE ... *\[*FROM ... *|*WITH TABLE KEY ...*\]*

The new operations are valid for all table categories and are, in this respect, generic (for details of the semantics, refer to the corresponding keyword documentation). In each of the statements, the key can be specified using a work area, either explicit or implicit (table with [header line](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abenheader_line_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")). The key values are then taken from the work area. In the statements READ and DELETE, the key can be specified explicitly in the form
... WITH TABLE KEY k1 = v1 ... kn = vn
Unlike the previous form of the READ statement, "WITH KEY k1 = v1 ... kn = vn", the new form must specify the key in full. This is tested within the syntax check.
The syntax of the new operations has been modeled as far as possible on the existing statements for reading, inserting, modifying and deleting table entries. Note the following rules of thumb:

-   In the new operations, the word TABLE comes directly before the table name itself

-   Use the addition WITH TABLE KEY to specify the key explicitly

Integration of the New Table Types

The new table types can be used both in the new table operations listed above and in existing ABAP statements. This means that the following statements can also be used on key tables:

-   [LOOP](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abaploop_at_itab.htm)

-   [AT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abapat_itab.htm)

Internal Tables and Extracts in Release 4.0

Modification 1

New addition for MODIFY: TRANSPORTING f1 f2 ...
Using the addition [TRANSPORTING f1 f2 ... *\[*WHERE cond*\]*](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abapmodify_itab.htm) of the statement MODIFY, it is now possible to target the content of individual fields and modify it (known as a selective field transport).

Modification 2

Unassigned field symbols for INSERT, SORT, and AT
If the field symbol <fs> was not yet assigned (using [ASSIGN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abapassign.htm)), it is ignored in the following statements:

-   [INSERT <fs> INTO fg.](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abapinsert_fg.htm)

-   [AT NEW <fs>.](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abapat_extract.htm)
    
-   [AT END OF <fs>.](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abapat_extract.htm)
    

Modification 3

LOOP ... WHERE for unstructured row types
A WHERE condition ([LOOP](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abaploop_at_itab.htm)) can now be formulated using the addition TABLE LINE for tables without structured row types (for example, tables with type I).
The same applies to the WHERE variants of the statements [DELETE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abapdelete_itab.htm) and [MODIFY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abapmodify_itab.htm).

ABAP SQL in Release 4.0

INNER JOIN and LEFT OUTER JOIN

It is now possible to read records from multiple logically associated database tables using a single SELECT command. This can be done using the new constructs INNER JOIN and LEFT OUTER JOIN in the [FROM clause](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abapfrom_clause.htm). In the past this was normally done using a nested SELECT loop. Replacing these loops with joins produces greatly improved runtime performance.

Subqueries

[Subqueries](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abensubquery_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") are now possible in the WHERE conditions of SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE commands. Tasks that previously required multiple SQL statements can now be solved more efficiently. A description of these subqueries is available in the documentation of the [relational expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abenwhere_logexp.htm).

HAVING Clause

The new [HAVING clause](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abaphaving_clause.htm) makes it possible to define further conditions for a set of results of a SELECT command created using [aggregation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abapselect_aggregate.htm) and [grouping](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abapgroupby_clause.htm).

RFC - Remote Function Call in Release 4.0

Asynchronous RFC

Modification 1

[WAIT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abapwait_until.htm) *\[*UNTIL condition*\]* UP TO time SECONDS
The command WAIT makes it possible to wait for a response from a
function module called asynchronously. This requires the addition PERFORMING form ON END OF TASK. WAIT must be executed in the same [internal session](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abeninternal_session_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Modification 2

RECEIVE RESULTS FROM FUNCTION func [KEEPING TASK](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abapreceive.htm)
The KEEPING TASK addition preserves the remote context in the subroutine for reuse.

Other Changes

Modification 3

Error messages from the remote system
If an error occurs in the target system in RFC, details of the [error message](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abenerror_message_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") are passed to the calling system (SY-MSGNO, SY-MSGID, SY-MSGTY, SY-MSGV1, SY-MSGV2, SY-MSGV3, and SY-MSGV4). These fields are set to initial in each RFC call.

Modification 4

Load checks for asynchronous RFC
For each RFC [destination](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abendestination_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), an improved load check is performed for asynchronous RFCs (menu path Destination -\>ARFC Options in the RFC destination maintenance screen in [AS ABAP](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abensap_nw_abap_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). Before the function module is executed, the system makes sure that the target host has enough resources. If the host is overloaded, the execution of the function module is delayed (internally) for a short time. The algorithm used to determine the load situation on the target machine is the same used in asynchronous RFC with the addition [DESTINATION IN GROUP](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abapcall_function_starting.htm). Be aware that this option can only be used for target hosts from Release 3.1H.

Modification 5

SNC option maintenance for RFC destinations
It is possible to define security options for each RFC destination. This is also possible for RFC Secure Network Communication. The SNC component (Secure Network Communications) provides added protection, for example by encrypting data transfers and applying secure mutual authorization between communication partners.
To use SNC, an external security product must be installed and entered in the profile (see, for example, parameter snc/enable). If SNC is used, it is possible to specify whether additional protection functions are used for this destination in the SNC Mode setting. If this is the case, additional SNC options must be defined in the menu bar: Destination -> SNC Options.

Modification 6

RFC clients as trusted systems
An RFC client that is registered as a trusted system can log on to the RFC server without a password. Trusted systems must be defined in the trusting system (the RFC server) using the transaction SMT1. In the trusted system, the transaction code SMT2 can be used to define which systems act as trusting systems.

Modification 7

Authorization check
If RFC communication takes place within a single system and in the same user context (with the same client and user name), no RFC authorization check based on function groups (using the [authorization object](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abenauthorization_object_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") S\_RFC) is performed. More information about this topic can be found in [RFC Authorizations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abenrfc_authority.htm).

Selection Screens in Release 4.0

[1\. Selection screens can now be used universally: CALL SELECTION-SCREEN.](#!ABAP_MODIFICATION_1@1@)

[2\. Variants can be assigned to more than one selection screen.](#!ABAP_MODIFICATION_2@2@)

[3\. Specifying a selection screen in the statement SUBMIT.](#!ABAP_MODIFICATION_3@3@)

[4\. The initial selection screen and variant can now be specified in transaction code maintenance for report transactions.](#!ABAP_MODIFICATION_4@4@)

[5\. More user-friendly design of the multiple selection GUI window](#!ABAP_MODIFICATION_5@5@)

[6\. Parameters and selection criteria with dynamic dictionary references](#!ABAP_MODIFICATION_6@6@)

[7\. Function modules RS\_SELECTIONSCREEN\_READ and RS\_SELECTIONSCREEN\_UPDATE for self-programmed F4 on selection screens.](#!ABAP_MODIFICATION_7@7@)

Modification 1

[Selection screens](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abenselection_screen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") can now be used universally: [CALL SELECTION-SCREEN  scrn](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abapcall_selection_screen.htm)
The language elements [SELECTION-SCREEN BEGIN/END OF SCREEN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abapselection-screen_definition.htm) can be used to define multiple selection screens in module pools and function groups. These selection screens are called using [CALL SELECTION-SCREEN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abapcall_selection_screen.htm).

Modification 2

Variants can be assigned to one or more selection screens. [CALL SELECTION-SCREEN scrn USING SELECTION-SET variant](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abapcall_selection_screen.htm)
Only the objects from the assigned screens are saved with the variant. Only the variants assigned to a screen are presented on that screen.

Modification 3

Specifying a selection screen in the statement [SUBMIT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abapsubmit.htm).
[SUBMIT report USING SELECTION-SCREEN scrn](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abapsubmit.htm) can be used to start a report using different selection screens.

Modification 4

Specifying the initial selection screen for a variant in transaction code maintenance for [report transactions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abenreport_transaction_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
This allows the initial screen to be set for a report started using a transaction code. A variant can also be made active when the transaction is called (including all of the usual features of variants, such as variables, hiding objects and so on). For example, different transactions can use the same report, but with different [selection screens](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abenselection_screen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or variants.

Modification 5

More user-friendly design of the multiple selection GUI window
This screen is now organized in a much clearer manner using
[tabstrip controls](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abentabstrip_control_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and table controls.

Modification 6

Parameters and selection criteria with dynamic dictionary references.
This allows dictionary references (and hence the type, length,
documentation, and value help) to be set at runtime.

Modification 7

Function modules RS\_SELECTIONSCREEN\_READ and RS\_SELECTIONSCREEN\_UPDATE.
In the same way as the function modules DYNP\_VALUES\_READ and DYNP\_VALUES\_UPDATE for regular [dynpros](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abendynpro_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"),
both function modules allow access to user entries on selection screens or values to be modified on selection screens with their own F4. These function modules were created with the multiple selection screen in mind, since the field names used there are unknown to the application program.

Logical Databases in Release 4.0

[1\. "Logical Nodes": Any node name, link to Dictionary or local type.](#!ABAP_MODIFICATION_1@1@)

[2\. Adjustment of maintenance transaction and program structure to Function Builder.](#!ABAP_MODIFICATION_2@2@)

[3\. Free callability without change of program memory using the function module LDB\_PROCESS.](#!ABAP_MODIFICATION_3@3@)

Modification 1

"Logical Nodes": The nodes of a logical database can have any name; the names are no longer strictly linked with the Dictionary tables. Instead, a node can have any Dictionary or local type. For example, a dictionary structure can be used for multiple nodes and a [logical database](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abenlogical_data_base_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") can return a complex data object "in one portion". New language element: NODES.

Modification 2

Adjustment to [Function Builder](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abenfunction_builder_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"): The created program structure and the Logical
Database Builder were adjusted to the form known to the Function Builder.

Modification 3

Free callability without change of program memory using the function module LDB\_PROCESS.
The restriction that logical databases can only be used with
[SUBMIT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abapsubmit.htm) is no longer valid. A logical database therefore can be used by any program to collect data. You can also call the same logical database more than once and nested calls of different logical databases are also allowed.
See documentation on the function module.

Time Stamps in Release 4.0

When time stamps were introduced in ABAP in Release 4.0, special attention was paid to the following:

-   Making the time stamp meaningful to a user in his or her particular time zone
    
-   Making objects uniquely identifiable by their time stamp by guaranteeing a hight level of precision
    

A current time stamp can be created in an ABAP program using the new variant [GET TIME STAMP FIELD f](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abapget_time-stamp.htm). It is always globally unique since it is not stored in local time, but always in [UTC](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abenutc_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") time (Universal Time Coordination, previously Greenwich Mean Time).
You can generate a time stamp with normal precision (to one second), or accurate to around one microsecond (1E-6 seconds).

To convert the time stamp to local time or to ABAP time and date format (data type T or D), use the following variants:
[CONVERT TIME STAMP tst INTO *\[*DATE*|*TIME*\]* ...](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abapconvert_time-stamp.htm)
and
[WRITE tst TIME ZONE tz](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abapwrite_to_options.htm)
.

Modification 1

Improved Behavior in [EDITOR-CALL FOR itab](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abapeditor-call_for_itab.htm)
The table is only returned with changes if saved in the editor. The new addition ... BACKUP INTO is used to return the table to its original state. Return Code is used to indicate whether change operations were performed in the editor.

Modification 2

New Variant [DESCRIBE FIELD f INTO td](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abapdescribe_field_into.htm)
This new variant can be used to determine all of the attributes of a data object f.
Also, a simple DESCRIBE can be used with the addition "HELP-ID hlp" to determine which help ID belongs to f if any.

Modification 3

[DATA:](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abapdata.htm) Fields ending with a '+' or '()' are no longer allowed.

Modification 4

ABAP Types 1 and 2
In Release 3.x, the ABAP types 1 and 2 were still supported in some areas in a very basic manner to retain R/2 compatibility. This is no longer the case in Release 4.0.

Modification 5

[WRITE: New Formatting Option NO-GROUPING](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abapwrite_to_options.htm)
If a field of type I or type P is displayed, its thousands separator is suppressed.

Modification 6

[WRITE: Improved Behavior in WRITE (name)...TO](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abapwrite_to.htm)
If the content of the field name is invalid, a return code is set and the target field is left unchanged.

Modification 7

[SET RUN TIME ANALYZER ON/OFF](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abapset_run_time_analyzer.htm)
The addition MODE is no longer used.

Modification 8

Arithmetic Using DICTIONARY types INT1 and INT2
Assignments and arithmetic using DICTIONARY types INT1 and INT2 as target fields must remain within the following value ranges:

-   INT1: 0 to 255
    
-   INT2: -32768 to 32767.
    

Otherwise a runtime error is produced.

Modification 9

PERFORM form(prog): Improved Behavior for Addition IF FOUND
The PERFORM statement is ignored if the program specified cannot be found.
