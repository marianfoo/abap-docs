Calling Transactions

A transaction is the execution of a program using a [transaction code](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abentransaction_code_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The program process flow depends on which [initial screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abeninitial_dynpro_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or [selection screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abenselection_screen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), or which method, the transaction code is linked to.

There are two statements for calling transactions:
