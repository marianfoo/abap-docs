Declaration Statements

This section describes the declaration statements (or declarative statements) for

-   [data types and data objects](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abentypes_and_objects.htm),

the statements for defining

-   [classes and interfaces](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abenclasses_and_interfaces.htm) and their components,

and the statement for declaring

-   [field symbols](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abenabap_field_symbols.htm)

The statements [PARAMETERS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abapparameters.htm) and [SELECT OPTIONS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abapselect-options.htm) for declaring input fields in [selection screens](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abenselection_screen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") are also declarative statements, but are executed separately in the respective sections.

Note

Alongside the explicit ways of declaring data objects described here, there are also statements and additions that declare data objects implicitly, such as [SELECTION-SCREEN COMMENT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abapselection-screen_comment.htm). However, most of these statements are obsolete (for example [SUMMING](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abapsumming.htm)).
