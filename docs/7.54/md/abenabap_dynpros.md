General Dynpros

Dynpro (sometimes also known as a screen) is an abbreviation for "dynamic program". A dynpro is a [repository](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abenrepository_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") object and is always a component of an ABAP program (a function group, executable program, or module pool). It consists of the [screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abenscreen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") with its screen elements and the [dynpro flow logic](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abendynpro_flow_logic_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). [Dynpro fields](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abendynpro_field_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") are assigned to the screen elements.

The flow logic contains processing blocks for events that are triggered before a screen is sent, and after user action on the displayed screen. General dynpros are edited using the [Screen Painter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abenscreen_painter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") tool. Special dynpros such as selection screens and lists are generated from ABAP statements.
