ABAP Objects - Overview

ABAP Objects is the object-oriented part of ABAP.

ABAP Objects adds a complete set of [language elements](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abenobjects_keywords.htm) to ABAP (previously only a procedural language) that allow [object-oriented programming](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abenobject_orientation.htm). This object-oriented extension of ABAP builds on the previous range of languages, and is fully compatible with them. ABAP Objects can be used in existing programs, and the [statements](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abenabap_objects_differences.htm) that can be used in ABAP Objects correspond to practically all of the remaining SAP language scope. Certain [obsolete language elements](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abenoo_differences_obsolete.htm), however, are not permitted in conjunction with ABAP objects due to a previous cleanup of the ABAP language.

ABAP Objects supports:

-   [Classes](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abenclasses.htm)

-   [Interfaces](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abeninterfac.htm)

-   [Objects](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abenobject.htm)

-   [Object references](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abenreferences.htm)

-   [inheritance](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abeninheritance.htm)

Note

The package SABAP\_DEMOS\_CAR\_RENTAL contains a complete example application written in ABAP Objects. Its presentation logic is implemented using a dynpro or Web Dynpro. The Web Dynpro calls interface methods that are implemented in a class and that, in turn, access classes that implement database accesses.
