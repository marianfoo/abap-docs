ABAP BDL - Syntax

The syntax of the Behavior Definition Language (BDL) is oriented to the [Data Definition Language](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abenddl_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") (DDL) used to define CDS entities. The artifacts in question have some technical differences however: BDL artifacts are managed by ABAP Compiler. This means ABAP Compiler is responsible for syntax checks and semantic checks and for generating the [behavior definitions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abenabap_behavior_definitions.htm).
