Built-In Functions

ABAP provides a set of built-in functions. A built-in function returns a return value for one or more arguments. Built-in functions can be called by functions in certain operand positions.

Built-in functions can be called functionally in [certain operand positions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abenoperands_expressions.htm). When a built-in function is called in an [operand position](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abenexpression_positions.htm), the function is executed before the operand is used and the return value of the built-in function is used as the operand, in accordance with its data type.
