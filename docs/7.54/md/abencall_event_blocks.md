Call Event Blocks

Event blocks are processing blocks in an ABAP program that are executed when the corresponding event occurs in the [ABAP runtime environment](javascript:call_link\('abenabap_runtime_envir_glosry.htm'\) "Glossary Entry"). These types of events can be raised in as program-driven events (and the event blocks where they are implemented called) in two cases:

-   Using the statement [SET USER-COMMAND](javascript:call_link\('abapset_user-command.htm'\)) in classic list processing

-   Using the statement [PUT](javascript:call_link\('abapput.htm'\)) in logical databases

Both statements are effectively obsolete. More information about them can be found in the relevant sections.
