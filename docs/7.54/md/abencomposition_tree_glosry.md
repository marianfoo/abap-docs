Composition Tree

Hierarchy of nodes in the structure of a [business object](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abenbusiness_object_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") where the nodes are linked by the [composition relationship](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abencomposition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Each node in a composition hierarchy has elements that are modeled in the [ABAP RESTful Programming Model](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abenr_a_p_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") using CDS entities, with the [root entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abenroot_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") as the top node in the business object’s structure.
