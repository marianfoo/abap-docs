directory traversal

Unauthorized access to files or directories. Directory traversals are possible in ABAP when external physical file names or file paths passed to programs are then passed to the [ABAP file interface](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abenfile_interface_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") without being checked or escaped. Directory traversals must be prevented by [validating file names](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abendataset_auth_self.htm),
