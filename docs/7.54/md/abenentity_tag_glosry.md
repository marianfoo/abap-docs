Entity Tag

Short: ETag

A field that is used to determine changes made to the requested resource.

A field flagged as an ETag field is typically used to describe, uniquely, the state of a requested resource (for example a specific entity instance). Often fields containing time stamps, check sums, or version numbers are used for this.
