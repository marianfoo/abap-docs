executable program

[ABAP program](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abenabap_program_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that can be executed using the [SUBMIT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abapsubmit.htm) statement. An executable program can be started by choosing System → Services → Reporting, or from other services such as [report transactions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abenreport_transaction_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). Whichever method is chosen, a SUBMIT is always executed internally. An executable program can have its own [dynpros](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abendynpro_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), be associated with a [logical database](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abenlogical_data_base_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), and be executed in [background processing](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abenbackround_processing_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
