grouping set

Grouping sets are used in the [GROUP BY](javascript:call_link\('abapgroupby_clause.htm'\)) clause of a [query](javascript:call_link\('abenquery_glosry.htm'\) "Glossary Entry"). A grouping set is specified either as an empty grouping set or as a comma-separated list. Columns and SQL expressions can also be used in the list. The GROUP BY addition GROUPING SETS makes it possible to define multiple grouping sets under a GROUP BY clause. The grouping sets are aggregated separately and grouped in a results set.
