grouping set

Grouping sets are used in the [GROUP BY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abapgroupby_clause.htm) clause of a [query](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abenquery_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). A grouping set is specified either as an empty grouping set or as a comma-separated list. Columns and SQL expressions can also be used in the list. The GROUP BY addition GROUPING SETS makes it possible to define multiple grouping sets under a GROUP BY clause. The grouping sets are aggregated separately and grouped in a results set.
