Association between multiple [database tables](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abendatabase_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in which each pair of tables involved are joined using conditions between one or more columns. Joins can be implemented declaratively as [views](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abenview_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in [ABAP Dictionary](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abenabap_dictionary_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), or programmatically as [join expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abenjoin_expression_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in the [SELECT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abapselect_join.htm) statement or in the [CDS DDL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abencds_ddl_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in [ABAP CDS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abenabap_cds_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). [CDS associations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abencds_association_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and [CTE associations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abencte_association_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), too, define join relationships, instances of which are created when the associations are used in [SQL path expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abencds_path_expression_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
