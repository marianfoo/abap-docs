Introducing ABAP Objects in Release 4.5

Outlook

The kernel functions of ABAP Objects are available from Release 4.5A. The following enhancements are planned for the coming functional releases: simple inheritance for classes, composition of interfaces, dynamic invocation interfaces, persistent objects, GUI integration, virtual attributes, friends, final classes and methods, embedded objects.

ABAP Objects will first be used productively in pilot projects, which will probably produce minor changes to the language. Activities that prepare for the introduction of ABAP Objects in the applications will be performed in parallel. This should answer any fundamental questions about object-oriented programming in ABAP centrally.
