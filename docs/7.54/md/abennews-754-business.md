Modification 1

Business Service

The [business service](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abenrpm_business_service.htm) is defined by the fact that the relevant data artifacts and the behavior model are made available for consumption. The business service is split into two different artifacts:

-   Business service definition (or service definition for short)
    A projection of the data model and of the associated behavior that is to be offered for consumption.

-   Business service binding (or service binding for short)
    Implements protocols (for example, OData) that are to be offered for consumption.
