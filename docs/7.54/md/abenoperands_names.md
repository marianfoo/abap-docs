Names for Individual Operands

An individual operand, meaning an operand that is not an expression, can be elementary or made up of components. Composite operands are:

-   Structured data types or data objects (structure)

-   Instances of classes (objects)

-   Classes

-   Interfaces

Accordingly, names for operands are either elementary names or names constructed from multiple names separated by component selectors. An elementary name is used for addressing:

-   elementary operands

-   components that are unique in the current context

-   superunits made up of components

[Naming conventions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abennaming_conventions.htm) apply to the elementary names. Composite names with component selectors are used for addressing individual components. A component can itself be a superunit of further components. Subcomponents can be addressed by [chaining](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abenchaining_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") multiple names.

As well as the component selectors specified here, [ABAP SQL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abenopen_sql_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") has a [column selector](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abentable_comp_selector_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") (~).
