pseudo component

table\_line expression that can be specified in reads on [internal tables](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abeninternal_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") instead of a [component](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abencomponent_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The entire row of the internal table is then interpreted as a single component. The name table\_line is a reserved name. In ABAP and in [ABAP Dictionary](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abenabap_dictionary.htm), no structure components called table\_line can be defined or created.
