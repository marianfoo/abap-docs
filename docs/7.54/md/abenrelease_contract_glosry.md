release contract

Classification of a [repository object](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abenrepository_object_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that specifies how it can be used as an API. There are currently three different release contracts: C0, which permits enhancement fields to be added at specified enhancement points, C1, which guarantees a stable interface for use within [AS ABAP](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abensap_nw_abap_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), and C2, which guarantees a stable interface for use outside AS ABAP too. Objects are classified in [ADT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abenadt_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or using special transactions such as SCFD\_REGISTRY.
