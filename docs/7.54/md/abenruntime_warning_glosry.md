runtime warning

A runtime warning indicates any critical situations, such as high memory use, that arise when executing a program and that could produce a [runtime error](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abenruntime_error_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). A runtime warning creates a [short dump](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abenshort_dump_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), but does not cancel the current program.
