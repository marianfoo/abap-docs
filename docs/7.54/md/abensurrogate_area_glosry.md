surrogate area

Set of the characters displayable in [Unicode](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abenunicode_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") (U+10000 to U+10FFFF) that includes, for example, musical notes or special Asian characters. Addressed directly in [UTF-8](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abenutf8_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and [UTF-32](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abenutf32_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"); addressed using [surrogates](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abensurrogates_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in [UTF-16](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abenutf16_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). [UCS-2](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abenucs2_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") (supported by the ABAP programming language) does not support characters from the surrogate area. ABAP interprets a character from the surrogate area as two characters.
