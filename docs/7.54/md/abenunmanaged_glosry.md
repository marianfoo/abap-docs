unmanaged

An implementation type of the [business object behavior](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abenbehavior_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in the context of the [ABAP RESTful programming model](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abenr_a_p_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

For this implementation type, all important components of the REST contract must be implemented first. All required operations (create, update, delete, plus any application-specific actions) must be defined in the associated [behavior definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_754_index_htm/7.54/en-US/abenbehavior_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") before being implemented in ABAP.
