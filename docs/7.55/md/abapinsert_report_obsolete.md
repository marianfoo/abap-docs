INSERT REPORT, UNICODE ENABLING

[Short Reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapinsert_report_shortref.htm)

Obsolete Syntax

INSERT REPORT ... UNICODE ENABLING ...

Effect

The addition UNICODE ENABLING of the statement [INSERT REPORT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapinsert_report.htm) has the same semantics as the addition VERSION which replaces it. If VERSION is specified, UNICODE ENABLING cannot be specified.

Hint

Before [ABAP language versions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_versions.htm) were introduced, the addition UNICODE ENABLING was used exclusively to configure the [Unicode check](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenunicode_check_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The general addition VERSION, on the other hand, makes it possible to configure further versions as well.
