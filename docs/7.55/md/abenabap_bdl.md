CDS BDL

\* Work in progress \*

The transactional behavior of a CDS entity is modeled using the Behavior Definition Language (BDL).

BDL describes the functions and properties of one or more [RAP business object](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrap_bo_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") nodes, such as

-   the [standard operations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbdl_standard_operations.htm) create, update, and delete (the CRUD operations),

-   application-specific operations ([actions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbdl_action.htm)),

-   definition of a [lock property](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbdl_lock.htm) for modifying operations on business object nodes, including the option of propagating locks to child nodes (known as a lock master/lock dependent relationship).
