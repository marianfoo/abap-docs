ABAP Objects - Stricter Syntax Rules

The ABAP language has been cleaned up in ABAP Objects. As part of this language cleanup, stricter syntax checks are performed for constructs that were previously allowed, or obsolete statements are no longer allowed at all. The stricter syntax checks usually result in syntax that should also be used outside of ABAP Objects, but where the old versions cannot be forbidden for compatibility reasons.

The various syntax revisions are listed in the documentation of the language elements and in particular in the list of [obsolete language elements](javascript:call_link\('abenabap_obsolete.htm'\)).

The stricter syntax applies to all [statements in ABAP Objects](javascript:call_link\('abenabap_objects_statements.htm'\)).
