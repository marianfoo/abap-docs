Business Function Set

BFS for short. [Repository object](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrepository_object_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that groups multiple [business functions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbusiness_function_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") to form a unit that covers the requirements of an industry solution within the scope of [Switch Framework](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenswitch_framework_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). For each [AS ABAP](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenas_abap_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") only one business function set can be activated. Within a business function set, it is ensured that all business functions are compatible with one another. Business function sets are created in [transaction](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abentransaction_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") SFW3 and switched in transaction SFW5.
