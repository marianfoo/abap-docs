CDS virtual element

Element in the element list of a [projection view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencds_projection_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") which is not included in the projected entity. Virtual elements are not persistent on the database, but calculated during runtime.
