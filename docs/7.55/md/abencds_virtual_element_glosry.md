CDS virtual element

Element in the element list of a [projection view](javascript:call_link\('abencds_projection_view_glosry.htm'\) "Glossary Entry") which is not included in the projected entity. Virtual elements are not persistent on the database, but calculated during runtime. In order to fill and analyze the virtual elements of a projection view, special frameworks like [SADL](javascript:call_link\('abensadl_glosry.htm'\) "Glossary Entry") have to be involved.
