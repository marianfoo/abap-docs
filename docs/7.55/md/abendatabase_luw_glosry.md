Also referred to as database transaction. Indivisible sequence of database operations concluded by a [database commit](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendatabase_commit_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The database LUW is either executed completely or not at all by the [database system](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendatabase_system_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
