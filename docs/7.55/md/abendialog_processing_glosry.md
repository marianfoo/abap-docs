dialog processing

Execution of programs in a [dialog session](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendialog_session_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). In contrast to [background processing](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbackround_processing_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), the flow of execution is not predefined at program start, but can be controlled by the user during the program flow. For dialog processing, dialog [work processes](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenwork_process_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") must be set up.
