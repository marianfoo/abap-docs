field selection

Property of a node of a [logical database](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenlogical_data_base_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). If a node is defined for field selection, it is possible to control which [fields](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenfield_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the node are supposed to be read from outside the logical database. Field selections are declared using the addition [FIELD SELECTION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapselection-screen_ldb_field.htm) of the statement [SELECTION-SCREEN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapselection-screen.htm) in the logical database.
