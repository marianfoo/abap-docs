internet Transaction Server

ITS for short. [Interface](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenintf_gen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") between an [AS ABAP](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenas_abap_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and the Internet. Internet Transaction Server is based on the data interface between [ABAP programs](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_program_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and [dynpros](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendynpro_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). It enables [users](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenuser_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") to communicate with an AS ABAP directly from the Internet by converting the [screens](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenscreen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of dynpros to HTML files, thus enabling them to be processed in a Web browser. ITS can be installed in addition to an AS ABAP. The ITS is replaced by the [Internet Communication Manager](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeninternet_con_man_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") (ICM) which is an interface to the Internet that is integrated directly as a process in the AS ABAP.
