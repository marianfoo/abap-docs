Expressions and Functions for Conditions

The flow control of a program is performed using [control structures](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencontrol_structure_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that are generally controlled by logical expressions. The following options exist for the formulation and evaluation of conditions:

-   [Logical expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenlogexp.htm)

-   [Logical functions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenlogic_functions.htm)
