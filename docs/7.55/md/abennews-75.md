The term [ABAP platform](javascript:call_link\('abenabap_platform_glosry.htm'\) "Glossary Entry") was introduced with ABAP release 7.53. For the ABAP platform, there is no standalone installation available. It is shipped indirectly with products as SAP S/4HANA on premise. The release number of the ABAP platform corresponds to SAP S/4HANA on premise release.

Hint

The term "ABAP platform" replaces the usage of the term "Application Server ABAP" in SAP Netweaver which itself replaced the term "SAP Basis". Nowadays, an "ABAP platform" plays the same role for ABAP written applications as formerly the SAP basis.
