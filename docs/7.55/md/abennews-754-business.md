Business Service

The [business service](javascript:call_link\('abenbusiness_service_glosry.htm'\) "Glossary Entry") is defined by the fact that the relevant data artifacts and the behavior model are made available for consumption. The business service is split into two different artifacts:

-   Business service definition (or service definition for short)
    A projection of the data model and of the associated behavior that is to be offered for consumption.

-   Business service binding (or service binding for short)
    Implements protocols (for example, OData) that are to be offered for consumption.
