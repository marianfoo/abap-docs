ABAP CDS in Release 7.55

[1\. Defining associations in CDS projection views](#!ABAP_MODIFICATION_1@1@)
[2\. CDS view entities](#!ABAP_MODIFICATION_2@2@)

Modification 1

Defining associations in CDS projection views

It is now possible to define new associations to external data sources in [CDS projection views](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencds_define_view_as_projection.htm).

Modification 2

CDS view entities

A new kind of CDS view is available: the [CDS view entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencds_v2_views.htm). CDS view entities represent an improved version of [CDS DDIC-based views](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencds_v1_views.htm) (DEFINE VIEW). They serve the same purpose and have the same structure as CDS DDIC-based views, but offer many advantages. CDS view entities are planned to replace CDS DDIC-based views in the future. A CDS view entity is defined with the statement DEFINE VIEW ENTITY.
