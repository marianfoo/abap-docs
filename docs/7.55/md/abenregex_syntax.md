regex - Syntax

A [regular expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) is a pattern of literal and special characters that describes a set of character strings. The syntax of regular expressions is widely standardized but there are differences between common standards as [Perl](https://www.perl.org/) or [POSIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX).

The following topics describe the syntax of regular expressions that can be used in ABAP behind additions PCRE*|*REGEX in statements or for arguments pcre*|*regex of built-in functions.

-   [PCRE syntax](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenregex_pcre_syntax.htm)

-   [POSIX syntax](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenregex_posix_syntax.htm)

ABAP specific restrictions or modifications to the standard syntax might apply.

Hint

The PCRE syntax is more powerful than the POSIX syntax. Furthermore, PCRE regular expressions generally perform better than the POSIX regular expressions supported by ABAP.
