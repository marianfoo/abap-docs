release contract

Classification of a [repository object](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrepository_object_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that controls its usability as an API. There are currently three different release contracts: C0, which allows enhancement fields to be added at specified enhancement points, C1, which allows a stable interface for use within the [AS ABAP](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenas_abap_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), and C2, which also guarantees a stable interface for use outside the AS ABAP. Objects are classified in [ADT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenadt_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or using special transactions such as SCFD\_REGISTRY.
