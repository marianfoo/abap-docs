Shared Objects - Areas

An area is a repository object for storing shared objects. It forms the template for [area instance versions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenarea_instance_version_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in the shared memory. An identically named [area class](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenarea_class_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and any [area root class](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenroot_data_class_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") are assigned to each area. Areas are created and managed in transaction SHMA. Various properties can be assigned to an area in transaction SHMA. From a technical perspective, the properties are respected when the area class is generated, or are stored automatically in the attributes of the area class when an [area handle](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenarea_handle_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is created.
