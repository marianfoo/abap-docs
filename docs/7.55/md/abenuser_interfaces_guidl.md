User Interfaces

The user interface is the interface between a (human) user and a machine, in this case between the user and the ABAP program that is running. In the ABAP environment, graphical user interfaces (GUIs) are used which can be operated using a keyboard, mouse, or other input devices. They are based on assorted interface technologies and use either SAP's own SAP GUI or are Web-based technologies that create HTML pages displayed using Web browsers.
