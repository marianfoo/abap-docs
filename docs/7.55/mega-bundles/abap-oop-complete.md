[ABAP - Keyword Documentation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap.htm)¬†‚Üí¬† [ABAP - Dictionary (DDIC)](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_dictionary.htm)¬†‚Üí¬†

DDIC - Replacement Objects

A [CDS view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencds_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") can be assigned to a [transparent](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abentransparent_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [DDIC database table](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenddic_database_tables.htm) and [DDIC database view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenddic_database_views.htm) in ABAP Dictionary as a replacement object using the name of its [CDS entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencds_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). A prerequisite is that the structure type defined by the CDS view matches the structure of the DDIC database table or DDIC database view as follows:

-   The number of components must match.

-   It must be possible to assign a component of the CDS view to each component of the DDIC database table or DDIC database view:

-   A [client column](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenclient_column_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is assigned regardless of its name.

-   For all other components of the DDIC database table, an identically named element of the CDS view must exist.

The order of the components in the DDIC database table and the CDS view does not need to match.

-   The technical type properties [built-in data type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenddic_builtin_types.htm), length, and number of decimal places must match for all assigned components.

-   The CDS view cannot have any input parameters.

-   It is not possible to have both a replacement object defined and table buffering switched on for a DDIC database view whose maintenance status is modifiable.

If a DDIC database table or a DDIC database view is accessed and a replacement object is assigned to the table or view in the following cases, the replacement object is evaluated instead of the DDIC database table or DDIC database view:

-   When used as a [data source](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapselect_data_source.htm) of a [SELECT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapselect.htm) statement in [ABAP SQL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_sql_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). This also applies to [subqueries](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abensubquery_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in any ABAP SQL statement and to the statements [OPEN CURSOR](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_cursor.htm) and [FETCH](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapfetch.htm). This bypasses any [table buffering](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abensap_puffering.htm) defined for the DDIC database table or the DDIC database view.

-   When a [foreign key relationship](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenforeign_key_dependency_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is checked for Web Dynpros or dynpros.

All other access types are still performed on the DDIC database table or DDIC database view, such as:

-   Writes in ABAP SQL

-   [Writes](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenopen_sql_writing.htm) in ABAP SQL

-   Use of the addition [SINGLE FOR UPDATE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapselect_single.htm) in the statement [SELECT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapselect.htm)

Writes of this type produce a syntax check warning.

-   Use in other database objects, such as:

-   Use as a data source of a view defined on the database

-   Access from database procedures or database functions

Here it is not important how the database object was created, which means that, in addition to native views, the views defined for [DDIC database views](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendatabase_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in ABAP Dictionary or for [CDS views](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencds_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") on the database also do not access the replacement object. A similar principle applies to [AMDP procedures](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenamdp_procedure_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and [AMDP functions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenamdp_function_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). Even if ABAP SQL is used to access a DDIC database view in ABAP Dictionary, a CDS view, or a [CDS table function](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencds_table_function_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") comprising DDIC database tables with replacement objects, no redirection is performed. In these cases, the replacement object must be accessed directly. For DDIC database views, a replacement object can be created that performs this task without the need to modify the programs.

-   Access types other than with ABAP SQL, for example:

-   Access using [IMPORT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapimport_data_cluster.htm) FROM [DATABASE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapimport_medium.htm), or [EXPORT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapexport_data_cluster.htm) TO [DATABASE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapexport_data_cluster_medium.htm).

-   Access using [Native SQL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abennative_sql.htm) ([ADBC](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenadbc_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), [EXEC SQL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapexec.htm)), and [AMDP](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenamdp_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

When a replacement object is defined for a DDIC database table for a DDIC database view, the system checks whether the specified CDS view meets the prerequisites. If a CDS view used as a replacement object is changed later and the prerequisites are no longer met, a runtime error DBSQL\_REDIRECT\_INCONSISTENCY occurs when an ABAP SQL read is performed on the DDIC database table or on the DDIC database view.

No replacement objects can be defined for [global temporary tables](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenglobal_temporary_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). In customer systems, replacement objects can only be defined for self-defined database views and not for DDIC database tables.

If there is a diversion to a CDS view for which one or more [CDS roles](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencds_role_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") are defined as part of the [CDS access control,](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencds_access_control_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") the associated access conditions are not evaluated when the replacement object is accessed.

Hints

-   Extreme care should be taken when specifying a replacement object for a DDIC database table or a DDIC database view. Incorrect usage can cause inconsistencies.

-   Replacement objects are mainly intended for existing aggregate tables. These are DDIC database tables, which contain aggregated data from other tables. Instead of aggregating data in an ABAP program and writing data to an aggregate table, which can be exclusively accessed by reads in programs, the aggregation can be performed for every read using the CDS view. This prevents redundant data from being stored. In addition, aggregation on the database can improve performance if it is necessary to read large volumes of data for aggregation in ABAP. Replacement objects can make this possible without invalidating the programs.

-   A prerequisite for assigning a replacement object to an existing DDIC database table or DDIC database view is that the CDS view returns the expected data and that, apart from aggregation, only ABAP SQL reads are performed on the aggregate table.

-   Once a replacement object is defined, no further writes should be performed on an aggregate table. These writes produce a syntax check warning and are scheduled to be disallowed in an upcoming release.

-   Make sure that, apart from the use of ABAP SQL, no other type of access is performed on an aggregate table with a replacement object. More specifically, CDS views used as a replacement object are not allowed to access the replaced object, because the content is usually no longer updated.

-   It is not advisable to transport table content for which a replacement object is defined. This content is scheduled to no longer be transported in an upcoming release.

-   Table buffering should be deactivated for an aggregate table for which a replacement object is defined to prevent buffer invalidations.

-   In customer systems, it may be useful to define a replacement object for a self-defined DDIC database view, if a replacement object was defined for one of their basis tables at SAP. In this case, the replacement object of the view must access the replacement object of the basis table.

-   If a DDIC database table or a DDIC database view , which a replacement object is defined for, is [extended](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenddic_enhancements.htm) in a follow-on system, the assigned CDS view must also be extended accordingly with [EXTEND VIEW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view.htm).

-   The [DDIC projection view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenddic_proj_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), [DDIC maintenance views](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenmaintenance_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), and [DDIC help views](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhelp_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") are not defined on the database. Access to their basis tables is carried out on AS ABAP by using ABAP SQL. If a basis table has a replacement object, its reads are redirected as required.

-   Frameworks that use ABAP SQL, such as [Data Browser](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendata_browser_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), automatically access replacement objects if these objects are defined for a DDIC database table or a DDIC database view. Frameworks that use Native SQL or AMDP, such as [SADL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abensadl_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), have to make sure that they access a replacement object rather than the DDIC database table or the DDIC database view.

-   If possible, programs that previously directly accessed aggregate tables or views with aggregate tables as base tables should be modified converted in such a way that they access the CDS views used as replacement objects directly. However, this cannot generally be done by simply replacing the data source in the SELECT statements concerned, for example because a client-dependent CDS view has no client column and therefore the target objects used no longer match. In addition, when a CDS view is accessed directly, the [CDS roles](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencds_role_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") defined for this CDS view have an effect.

-   Replacement objects cannot be defined for the following:

-   [DDIC Projection Views](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenddic_projection_views.htm)

-   [DDIC maintenance views](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenddic_maintenance_views.htm)

-   [DDIC help views](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenddic_help_views.htm)

Description

This program accesses two DDIC database tables, DEMO\_SUMDIST\_AGG and DEMO\_SUMDIST. These tables are identical except for the fact that the [CDS view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencds_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") DEMO\_CDS\_SUMDIST is defined as a [replacement object](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenddic_replacement_objects.htm) for DEMO\_SUMDIST.

The DDIC database table DEMO\_SUMDIST\_AGG is filled with aggregated data (done here in the static constructor of the class demo). When DEMO\_SUMDIST is accessed, the replacement object performs exactly the same aggregation:

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_SUDI'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
define view demo\_cds\_sumdist(
¬†¬†¬†¬†client,
¬†¬†¬†¬†carrname,
¬†¬†¬†¬†distid,
¬†¬†¬†¬†sum\_distance
¬†¬†)
¬†¬†as select from
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† scarr as s
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†join spfli as p on
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†s.carrid = p.carrid
¬†¬†¬†¬†{
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†key s.mandt,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†key s.carrname,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†key p.distid,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†sum(p.distance)
¬†¬†¬†¬†}
¬†¬†¬†¬†group by
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†s.mandt,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†s.carrname,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†p.distid

Similar access to the DDIC database tables produce similar results, which can be verified using the statement [ASSERT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapassert.htm).

A third SELECT statement accesses the [CDS view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencds_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") DEMO\_CDS\_SUMDIST directly. To produce the same result set for the comparison with the other results as when accessing the DDIC database tables, the [client column](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenclient_column_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") must be added, since the result set of a [client-dependent CDS view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenclient_dependent_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") does not contain a column of this type.

A [DDIC database view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendatabase_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") DEMO\_SUMDIST\_OBS contains the DDIC database table DEMO\_SUMDIST as a basis table. There is no redirect to the replacement object of DEMO\_SUMDIST in a SELECT. A DDIC database view DEMO\_SUMDISTVIEW that is otherwise similar has the following CDS view as a replacement object:

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_SUDIV'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
define view demo\_cds\_sumdistview
¬†¬†as select from
¬†¬†¬†¬†demo\_cds\_sumdist
¬†¬†¬†¬†{
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†key client,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†key carrname,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†key distid,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†sum\_distance
¬†¬†¬†¬†}

This view accesses the replacement object of the DDIC database table DEMO\_SUMDIST. When DEMO\_SUMDISTVIEW is accessed using SELECT, its replacement object is evaluated and the result again matches the preceding result.

ABAP CDS - Behavior Definitions

\* Work in progress \*

A [CDS behavior definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencds_behavior_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is created using [CDS BDL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencds_bdl_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in [BDL source code](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbdl_source_code_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

A business object behavior definition (behavior definition for short) is an ABAP repository object (a source text artifact) that represents the behavior of the [RAP business object](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrap_bo_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in the context of [ABAP RAP](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_rap_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

A behavior definition always references a CDS data model. The matching name of the CDS entity ensures that a behavior definition has a reference to the data model. This also means that the data model must always exist before the behavior definition, as shown in the following example:

The CDS definition define root view /DMO/I\_Travel ... must exist before a behavior definition /DMO/I\_Travel can be created. The CDS view /DMO/I\_Travel is the [root entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenparent_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in the data structure.

Once the behavior definition is created, the root entity becomes a transactional entity and can, in principle, be used in modifying REST operations. All operations in the specific business object that have transactional support must be specified in this behavior definition.

The transactional behavior of a CDS entity is modeled using CDS Behavior Definition Language ([CDS BDL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencds_bdl_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")).

Rules

-   A root entity can have at most one behavior definition, in which the behavior of the child entities may need to be specified too. Conversely, a behavior definition has exactly one root entity.

-   The [implementation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_behavior_pools.htm) of a behavior definition can be made in both a single ABAP class (a [behavior pool](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbehavior_pool_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")) or spread across any number of ABAP classes (behavior pools). This means that any number of behavior pools can be assigned to a behavior definition (a 1:n relation).

CDS BDL

\* Work in progress \*

The transactional behavior of a CDS entity is modeled using the Behavior Definition Language (BDL).

BDL describes the functions and properties of one or more [RAP business object](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrap_bo_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") nodes, such as

-   the [standard operations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbdl_standard_operations.htm) create, update, and delete (the CRUD operations),

-   application-specific operations ([actions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbdl_action.htm)),

-   definition of a [lock property](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbdl_lock.htm) for modifying operations on business object nodes, including the option of propagating locks to child nodes (known as a lock master/lock dependent relationship).

The artifacts in question have some technical differences however: BDL artifacts are managed by ABAP Compiler. This means ABAP Compiler is responsible for syntax checks and semantic checks and for generating the [behavior definitions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencds_behavior_definitions.htm).

CDS BDL - General Syntax Rules

\* Work in progress \*

The following rules apply to the CDS Behavior Definition Language ([CDS BDL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencds_bdl_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")) syntax:

Keywords

-   Keywords must be all lowercase letter.
    Example: Create or CreaTe are both invalid keywords. create,, however, is valid.

Names

-   Names should be written in mixed case style (also referred to as camel case style). Here, uppercase marks the beginnings of words within a combined name.
    Example: TravelEntity, CDSEntityName, Travel\_Entity\_Name are valid names.

Comments

-   Two forward slashes (//) introduce a comment, which continues until the end of the line.
    Example: internal create; //standard operation create

-   Comments within lines or that span multiple lines are enclosed by the characters /\* and \*/.
    Example: /\* Entity properties\*/

Separators

-   Statements must be closed using a semicolon (;).
    Example: implementation unmanaged;

Tip

It is a good idea to use the same spelling of names as in ABAP CDS.

CDS BDL - Structure

\* Work in progress \*

A behavior definition consists of a header part and a sequence of entity behavior definitions. An entity behavior definition consists of a section containing properties of the entity plus operations enclosed in curly brackets {}.

The following depicts the syntax structure of a behavior definition that itself defines the transactional behavior of CDS\_Entity\_name.

/\* Header part of the behavior definition \*/
implementation unmanaged *|* managed *|* abstract
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† *\[*in class class\_name unique*\]*;

}

Rules

-   Not every entity property ([late numbering](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbdl_late_numbering.htm), [etag](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbdl_etag.htm), or [lock](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbdl_lock.htm)) from the [composition tree](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencds_composition_tree_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is a mandatory property.

-   A property can occur a maximum of once in a behavior definition.

-   If an entity does not occur in the behavior definition, the entity does not have a transactional character (it is read-only).

CDS BDL - Syntax

\* Work in progress \*

The syntax of the Behavior Definition Language (BDL) is oriented to the [Data Definition Language](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenddl_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") (DDL) used to define CDS entities. The artifacts in question have some technical differences however: BDL artifacts are managed by ABAP Compiler. This means ABAP Compiler is responsible for syntax checks and semantic checks and for generating the [behavior definitions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencds_behavior_definitions.htm).

CDS BDL - IMPLEMENTATION

\* Work in progress \*

Syntax

implementation unmanaged*|*managed*|*abstract *\[*in class class\_name unique*\]*;

Effect

The implementation type of the [business object behavior](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrap_bo_behavior_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is introduced in the [behavior definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencds_behavior_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") using the keyword implementation.

Implementation types can be split into the following categories:

-   unmanaged
    In the case of the implementation type unmanaged, all important components of the REST contract must be implemented first. All required operations (the [standard operations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbdl_standard_operations.htm) create, update, and delete plus any application-specific [actions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbdl_action.htm)) must be defined in the relevant behavior definition before being implemented in ABAP. This implementation type is best used when using existing legacy business logic for [behavior implementation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbehavior_implement_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

-   managed
    The implementation type managed is best used when implementing completely new business logic. In this case, a behavior definition is sufficient to obtain a ready-to-run business object.

-   abstract
    A behavior definition with the implementation type abstract cannot be implemented using [behavior pools](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbehavior_pool_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and is used as a metadata-only artifact in the representation of external services instead.

A behavior definition can specify one or more classes which allow the behavior implementation of a business object. This can be done by using the addition [in class ... unique](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbdl_in_class_unique.htm) in the behavior definition of the business object.

Effect of in class ... unique:

-   A behavior for the entity in question can only be implemented in a behavior pool with the specified name. Any other class that attempts this raises an ABAP Compiler error.

-   If the addition in class ... unique is specified, an operation must not be implemented multiple times in different [handler classes](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabp_handler_class.htm).

Example

In the following example, the data from the ABAP flight data reference scenario (or flight data scenario for short) is used. It represents a legacy business logic that can be used to create and process flight bookings. The CDS view /DMO/I\_Travel represents the root node of the business object for managing flight trips. The underlying business model is described in CDS BDL - Example.

The following example shows the behavior definition for the root entity Travel. In the example, the implementation type is set to unmanaged because the existing legacy business logic needs to be integrated into the new application for managing flight trips.

implementation unmanaged;
define behavior for /DMO/I\_Travel alias Travel
{
¬†¬†create;
¬†¬†update;
¬†¬†delete;

Effect

Similarly to CDS entities, the [behavior](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrap_bo_behavior_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") for an entity can be divided into a part for once-only specifications (implementation, late numbering, etag, and lock), followed by a part of multiple specifications (field, standard operations, actions, and associations) enclosed in {...}.

Example

In the following example, the data from the ABAP flight data reference scenario (or flight data scenario for short) is used. It represents a legacy business logic that can be used to create and process flight bookings. The CDS view /DMO/I\_Travel represents the root node of the business object for managing flight trips. The underlying business model is described in CDS BDL - Example.

The following example shows the behavior definition for the root entity Travel.

CDS BDL - DEFINE BEHAVIOR, alias

\* Work in progress \*

Syntax

... alias AliasName

Effect

Behavior Definition Language ([CDS BDL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencds_bdl_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")) makes it possible to define an alias name AliasName for a CDS entity.

A BDL alias for an entity makes it possible to introduce a alias name for a CDS entity. This name can be clearer than the entity name itself, since it does not need to be uniquely global in [ABAP Dictionary](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_dictionary_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

The alias name is visible in the method syntax of the [behavior implementation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_behavior_pools.htm) of the business object and in the [derived types](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrpm_derived_types.htm).

The length of an alias name AliasName is restricted to 20 characters.

Example

In the following example, the data from the ABAP flight data reference scenario (short: flight data scenario) is used. It represents a legacy business logic that can be used to create and process flight bookings. The CDS view /DMO/I\_Travel represents the root node of the business object for managing air travel. The underlying data is described in CDS BDL - Example.

The following example shows the behavior definition for the root entity Travel. The business object whose CDS data model is represented by the root entity /DMO/I\_Travel can be given an alias, in this instance Travel.

CDS BDL - DEFINE BEHAVIOR, in class unique

\* Work in progress \*

Syntax

... *\[*implementation*\]* in class ClassName unique

Effect

A behavior definition can specify one or more [global classes](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabp_global_class.htm) that allow the behavior implementation of a business object. This can be specified in two places:

-   In the header of the business object behavior definition.

implementation unmanaged*|*managed in class ClassName unique;
¬†¬†define behavior for CDSEntityName alias AliasName
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†...
or

-   In the behavior definition of each CDS entity.

implementation unmanaged*|*managed;
¬†¬†define behavior for CDSEntityName alias AliasName
¬†¬†¬†¬†implementation in class ClassName unique
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†...

A specification for each business object applies to all entities that do not have their own specification for define behavior (that is, a definition for a single entity overwrites the definition for each business object).

Effect of specifying in class ClassName unique:

-   Behavior for the entity in question can only be implemented in a [behavior pool](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbehavior_pool_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") with the specified name ClassName. Any other class that attempts this raises an ABAP Compiler error.

-   An operation (a [standard operation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbdl_standard_operations.htm) or an [action](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbdl_action.htm)) must not be implemented multiple times in different [handler classes](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabp_handler_class.htm).

CDS BDL - DEFINE BEHAVIOR, late numbering

\* Work in progress \*

Syntax

... late numbering *\[*in place*\]*

Effect

Late numbering is a concept for gapless assignments of unique keys when creating new entity instances. New entity instances are given their final key shortly before the [RAP business object](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrap_bo_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is saved. Until this moment, the application logic uses a temporary key that has to be replaced when the business object data is saved.

The addition in place indicates that a CDS entity uses its own key fields for late numbering. These key fields are written to the special values, which are identified as temporary. This means that the [derived types](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrpm_derived_types.htm) for the entity do not contain an additional field [%PID](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencomponents_derived_types.htm). The task when assigning the keys (TYPE TABLE FOR MAPPED) therefore is to map from a temporary key to the final key and not to map from a %PID to the final key. This means that the mapped structure contains the entity key fields twice, once as a component %TMP and once as a component [%KEY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencomponents_derived_types.htm).

Late numbering must be applied by implementing the method [adjust\_numbers()](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abensaver_adjust_numbers.htm) of the local [saver class](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabp_saver_class.htm) that is part of the [behavior implementation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbehavior_implement_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). When declared in the [behavior definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencds_behavior_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the entity, late numbering causes the runtime to call the method adjust\_numbers() at the time in question. This implementation is then responsible for assigning the final keys and passing them to the method parameter mapped.

Remarks

-   The parameter mapped is used to pass the final keys to the framework and hence replace the temporary keys. Ideally, this replacement action is decoupled from the actual saving of the data but many legacy applications determine their keys when the data is saved. In these cases, it is best to implement the save logic in adjust\_numbers() and leave the method [save](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abensaver_method_save.htm) itself empty.

-   Late numbering modifies the derived types: The tables mapped, reported, and failed are given the additional field %PID to hold a temporary key.

Example

In the following example, the data from the ABAP flight data reference scenario (or flight data scenario for short) is used. It represents a legacy business logic that can be used to create and process flight bookings. The CDS view /DMO/I\_Travel represents the root node of the business object for managing flight trips. The underlying business model is described in CDS BDL - Example.

The following example shows the behavior definition for the root entity Travel.

{
¬†¬†create;
¬†¬†update;
¬†¬†delete;

CDS BDL - DEFINE BEHAVIOR, etag

\* Work in progress \*

Syntax

... etag field|AncestorEntity~Field ( LocalField = MasterField )

Effect

The etag field field of an entity is used for locks in the OData protocol. It references either the entity itself or the parent entity AncestorEntity for which a foreign key relationship LocalField = MasterField must be specified.

A field flagged as an entity tag (ETag) field field is typically used to describe, uniquely, the state of a requested resource (for example a specific entity instance). Any changes made to the requested resource update the etag field. Often fields containing time stamps, check sums, or version numbers are used for this.

In the [behavior implementation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbehavior_implement_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), the method [read](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhandler_method_read.htm) of the [handler class](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabp_handler_class.htm) is called, which then requests the current ETag for the resource as shown in the following example. The process flow is as follows:

-   If an entity has an ETag field in its [behavior definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencds_behavior_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), a write operation (such as update) passes an if match header with the value of the ETag in the query and hence informs the framework of the expected state.

-   The method read then checks whether the requested resource exists in a buffered state or, if not, whether it needs to be read from the database.

-   The value of the ETag is then passed to the framework using the output parameters of the read method.

-   The framework checks both values and calls the write operation only if they match.

Note

An ETag can be used for optimistic locks in shared OData protocol access, where it prevents simultaneous updates on a resource from overwriting each other.

Example

In the following example, the data from the ABAP flight data reference scenario (or flight data scenario for short) is used. It represents a legacy business logic that can be used to create and process flight bookings. The CDS view /DMO/I\_Travel represents the root node of the business object for managing flight trips.

CDS BDL - DEFINE BEHAVIOR, lock

\* Work in progress \*

Syntax

... lock master*|*dependent ( LocalField = MasterField )

Effect

A behavior definition can specify the following for an entity:

-   The entity supports direct locks (by specifying the entity property lock master)
    or

-   the entity is dependent on the lock status of a parent entity or root entity (by specifying the entity property lock dependent).

A foreign key relationship must be defined for any lock dependencies. This relationship describes which field in the child entity references which field in the parent entity, expressed using LocalField = MasterField in BDL syntax.

Remarks [ABAP RAP](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_rap_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") supports lock master for root nodes of the [RAP business object](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrap_bo_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") only.

-   The lock property is only relevant for those entities that provide change operations (such as update).

Example

In the following example, the data from the ABAP flight data reference scenario (or flight data scenario for short) is used. It represents a legacy business logic that can be used to create and process flight bookings. The CDS view /DMO/I\_Travel represents the root node of the business object for managing flight trips.

CDS BDL - DEFINE BEHAVIOR, field

\* Work in progress \*

Syntax

... field(read only *|* mandatory) field*\[*, field, ...*\]*;

Effect

Some fields of a CDS entity can be specified to which certain access restrictions apply:

-   field(read only) FieldName;
    The field FieldName cannot be modified by the operations create and update.

-   field(mandatory) FieldName;
    The field FieldName must be given a value in create operations. In update operations, it must not be given the null value.

Note

Commas can be used to classify multiple fields, Field1, Field2, Field3, ... in the same way:

field(read only) Field1, Field2, Field3;

field(mandatory) Field4, Field5;

Example

In the following example, the data from the ABAP flight data reference scenario (or flight data scenario for short) is used. It represents a legacy business logic that can be used to create and process flight bookings. The CDS view /DMO/I\_Travel represents the root node of the business object for managing flight trips.

CDS BDL - DEFINE BEHAVIOR, Standard Operations

\* Work in progress \*

Syntax

... *\[*internal*\]* create;
¬†¬†¬†¬†*\[*internal*\]* update;
¬†¬†¬†¬†*\[*internal*\]* delete;

Effect

The standard operations create, update, and delete (known as the CRUD operations) are the most important operations for the transactional behavior of a [RAP business object](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrap_bo_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The operations create, update, and delete must be declared appropriately in the [behavior definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencds_behavior_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") for an entity whenever an entity is created, updated, or deleted.

A standard operation can be given the addition internal. This makes it possible to implement the action without making it consumable from outside. Example: internal update;

CRUD operations can be made available for an entity simply by declaring them in the body of the entity in question.

The [behavior](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrap_bo_behavior_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") for the operations create, update, and delete is implemented in the method [FOR MODIFY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhandler_method_modify.htm) of the [handler class](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabp_handler_class.htm).

Note

The [FOR LOCK](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhandler_method_lock.htm) method of the handler class is called automatically before a change operation (such as update) is triggered. However, the corresponding entity must have the lock property in its behavior definition.

Example

In the following example, the data from the ABAP flight data reference scenario (or flight data scenario for short) is used. It represents a legacy business logic that can be used to create and process flight bookings. The CDS view /DMO/I\_Travel represents the root node of the business object for managing flight trips. The underlying business model is described in CDS BDL - Example.

The following example shows the behavior definition for the root entity Travel.

implementation unmanaged;
define behavior for /DMO/I\_Travel alias Travel
lock master
{
¬†¬†create;
¬†¬†update;
¬†¬†delete;
}

The transactional behavior of the business object is defined by the standard operations create, update, and delete. These operations are [implemented](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_behavior_pools.htm) in the association [behavior pools](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbehavior_pool_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

CDS BDL - DEFINE BEHAVIOR, action

\* Work in progress \*

Syntax

... *\[*internal*\]* *\[*static*\]* action ActionName
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† *\[*external LongName*\]*
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† *\[*parameter InputParameterEntity*|*$self*\]*
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† *\[*result cardinality OutputParameterEntity*|*$self*\]*;

Effect

In behavior definitions, actions can be specified as application-specific operations. Actions can either reference an instance (the default case, without the keyword static) or they can be static (with the keyword static).

An action can also be given the keyword internal. This makes it possible to implement the action without making it consumable from outside.

Input and output parameters are optional. Actions can pass CDS entities as input parameters (InputParameterEntity) and as output parameters (OutputParameterEntity). The CDS entity can be a regular CDS view or a CDS abstract entity. If InputParameterEntity and OutputParameterEntity are also the entity for which the action is executed, only the predefined keyword $self is required. In this case, the keyword stands for the type of the entity itself.

InputParameterEntity can be any type defined in ABAP Dictionary or ABAP CDS. OData accepts structured types only. EML can also handle elementary types.

An instance action is always multi-instance-enabled. The result [cardinality](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencardinality_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in instance actions specifies whether an input instance points to 0..1, 1, 0..n, or 1..n instances. The potential cardinality values are therefore as follows: \[0..1\], \[1\], \[0..\*\] or \[1..\*\].

An action can also be given an external name. Here is one example:

action ActionName external 'AVeryLongExternalActionName'
¬†¬†¬†¬† result \[0..1\] OutputParameter;

The external name can be up to 128 characters long. It will only be exposed in the OData metadata. It is ignored within ABAP, for example the action cannot be addressed in [Entity Manipulation Language](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeneml.htm) using the external name.

Note

The BDL syntax specifies that a maximum of one input parameter and a maximum of one output parameter can be specified. If an action requires more than one input or output, a CDS structure type or an abstract entity can be used with components for each input or output.

Example

In the following example, the data from the ABAP flight data reference scenario (short: flight data scenario) is used. It models a legacy business logic that can be used to create and process flight bookings. The CDS view /DMO/I\_Travel represents the root node of the business object for managing air travel.

The following example shows the behavior definition for the root entity Travel.

implementation unmanaged;
define behavior for /DMO/I\_Travel alias Travel
{
¬†¬†create;
¬†¬†update;
¬†¬†delete;
¬†¬†action set\_status\_booked result \[1\] $self;
}

The transactional [behavior](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrap_bo_behavior_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the [RAP business object](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrap_bo_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") travel is defined by the [standard operations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbdl_standard_operations.htm) create, update, and delete plus one action. The end user can use the action set\_status\_booked to set the status of a trip to booked. The action set\_status\_booked is bound to an instance of the type travel, which in this case is also returned by the action. This means the cardinality equals \[1\] and $self is set as the type of the output parameter.

CDS BDL - DEFINE BEHAVIOR, association

\* Work in progress \*

Syntax

... *\[*internal*\]* association AssociationName
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† *\[*abbreviation AbbreviationName*\]* {*\[**\[*internal*\]*create;*\]*};

Effect

An important behavior part of an entity is the transactional enabling of its associations. This affects both reads (Read-By-Association) and creates (Create-By-Association) along CDS associations. Here, the associations in question must be specified explicitly in the behavior definition.

To activate reads for an association, either the statement association AssociationName; or association AssociationName {} can be used.

The keyword {create;} is used to declare that instances of the associated entity can be created along the association. Example: association \_Booking { create; }

An association can be given the addition internal. This makes it possible to implement the action without making it consumable from outside. This affects both read and create actions along CDS associations. Example: internal association \_Booking { create; }

If the create action is internally activated (it can be implemented but is not consumable), the operation create can be given the addition internal. Example: association \_Booking { internal create; }

The addition abbreviation defines an alternative name, in a similar way to alias for entities. AbbreviationName is not an alias, however, which is why a different keyword is used here. Associations are in the namespace of their root entity, which is why their names are usually easy to read and no more than 30 characters long. This is too long for [ABAP RAP](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_rap_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), since certain component names are created by concatenating association names and default suffixes. This why an abbreviation AbbreviationName must be defined if the name of the association in the CDS view exceeds the length of 11 characters.

Example

In the following example, the data from the ABAP flight data reference scenario (short: flight data scenario) is used. It represents a legacy business logic that can be used to create and process flight bookings. The CDS view /DMO/I\_Travel represents the root node of the business object for managing air travel. The underlying data is described in CDS BDL - Example.

The following example shows the behavior definition for the root entity Travel.

implementation unmanaged;
define behavior for /DMO/I\_Travel alias Travel
{
¬†¬†create;
¬†¬†update;
¬†¬†delete;
¬†¬†association \_Booking { create; }
}

The association \_Booking specifies that new instances of the child entity Booking can be created for a specific instance of the entity Travel only. The keyword { create; } indicates that this assignment is activated for the standard operation create. Therefore, booking instances can only be created using a travel instance Travel.

Effect

Similarly to CDS entities, the [behavior](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrap_bo_behavior_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") for an entity can be divided into a part for once-only specifications (implementation, late numbering, etag, and lock), followed by a part of multiple specifications (field, standard operations, actions, and associations) enclosed in {...}.

Example

In the following example, the data from the ABAP flight data reference scenario (or flight data scenario for short) is used. It represents a legacy business logic that can be used to create and process flight bookings. The CDS view /DMO/I\_Travel represents the root node of the business object for managing flight trips. The underlying business model is described in CDS BDL - Example.

The following example shows the behavior definition for the root entity Travel.

CDS BDL

\* Work in progress \*

The transactional behavior of a CDS entity is modeled using the Behavior Definition Language (BDL).

BDL describes the functions and properties of one or more [RAP business object](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrap_bo_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") nodes, such as

-   the [standard operations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbdl_standard_operations.htm) create, update, and delete (the CRUD operations),

-   application-specific operations ([actions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbdl_action.htm)),

-   definition of a [lock property](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbdl_lock.htm) for modifying operations on business object nodes, including the option of propagating locks to child nodes (known as a lock master/lock dependent relationship).

ABAP CDS - Behavior Definitions

\* Work in progress \*

A [CDS behavior definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencds_behavior_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is created using [CDS BDL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencds_bdl_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in [BDL source code](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbdl_source_code_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

A business object behavior definition (behavior definition for short) is an ABAP repository object (a source text artifact) that represents the behavior of the [RAP business object](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrap_bo_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in the context of [ABAP RAP](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_rap_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

A behavior definition always references a CDS data model. The matching name of the CDS entity ensures that a behavior definition has a reference to the data model. This also means that the data model must always exist before the behavior definition, as shown in the following example:

The CDS definition define root view /DMO/I\_Travel ... must exist before a behavior definition /DMO/I\_Travel can be created. The CDS view /DMO/I\_Travel is the [root entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenparent_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in the data structure.

Once the behavior definition is created, the root entity becomes a transactional entity and can, in principle, be used in modifying REST operations. All operations in the specific business object that have transactional support must be specified in this behavior definition.

The transactional behavior of a CDS entity is modeled using CDS Behavior Definition Language ([CDS BDL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencds_bdl_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")).

Rules

-   A root entity can have at most one behavior definition, in which the behavior of the child entities may need to be specified too. Conversely, a behavior definition has exactly one root entity.

-   The [implementation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_behavior_pools.htm) of a behavior definition can be made in both a single ABAP class (a [behavior pool](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbehavior_pool_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")) or spread across any number of ABAP classes (behavior pools). This means that any number of behavior pools can be assigned to a behavior definition (a 1:n relation).

The artifacts in question have some technical differences however: BDL artifacts are managed by ABAP Compiler. This means ABAP Compiler is responsible for syntax checks and semantic checks and for generating the [behavior definitions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencds_behavior_definitions.htm).

CDS BDL - General Syntax Rules

\* Work in progress \*

The following rules apply to the CDS Behavior Definition Language ([CDS BDL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencds_bdl_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")) syntax:

Keywords

-   Keywords must be all lowercase letter.
    Example: Create or CreaTe are both invalid keywords. create,, however, is valid.

Names

-   Names should be written in mixed case style (also referred to as camel case style). Here, uppercase marks the beginnings of words within a combined name.
    Example: TravelEntity, CDSEntityName, Travel\_Entity\_Name are valid names.

Comments

-   Two forward slashes (//) introduce a comment, which continues until the end of the line.
    Example: internal create; //standard operation create

-   Comments within lines or that span multiple lines are enclosed by the characters /\* and \*/.
    Example: /\* Entity properties\*/

Separators

-   Statements must be closed using a semicolon (;).
    Example: implementation unmanaged;

Tip

It is a good idea to use the same spelling of names as in ABAP CDS.

CDS BDL - Structure

\* Work in progress \*

A behavior definition consists of a header part and a sequence of entity behavior definitions. An entity behavior definition consists of a section containing properties of the entity plus operations enclosed in curly brackets {}.

The following depicts the syntax structure of a behavior definition that itself defines the transactional behavior of CDS\_Entity\_name.

/\* Header part of the behavior definition \*/
implementation unmanaged *|* managed *|* abstract
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† *\[*in class class\_name unique*\]*;

/\* Entity behavior definition \*/
define behavior for CDS\_Entity\_name *\[*alias AliasName*\]*

/\* Entity properties \*/
*\[*implementation in class ClassName unique*\]*
*\[*late numbering *\[*in place*\]**\]*
*\[*etag field *|* AncestorEntity~Field ( LocalField = MasterField )*\]*
*\[*lock master *|* dependent ( LocalField = MasterField )*\]*

/\* Curly bracket \*/
{

/\* Access restrictions \*/
field (read only | mandatory) field*\[*, field, ...*\]*;

/\* Standard Operations\*/
*\[*internal*\]* create;
*\[*internal*\]* update;
*\[*internal*\]* delete;

/\* Actions \*/
*\[*internal*\]* *\[*static*\]* action ActionName

*\[*internal*\]* association AssociationName
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† *\[*abbreviation AbbreviationName*\]* {*\[**\[*internal;*\]*create;*\]*};

/\* Curly bracket \*/
}

Rules

-   Not every entity property ([late numbering](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbdl_late_numbering.htm), [etag](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbdl_etag.htm), or [lock](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbdl_lock.htm)) from the [composition tree](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencds_composition_tree_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is a mandatory property.

-   A property can occur a maximum of once in a behavior definition.

-   If an entity does not occur in the behavior definition, the entity does not have a transactional character (it is read-only).

CDS BDL - Syntax

\* Work in progress \*

The syntax of the Behavior Definition Language (BDL) is oriented to the [Data Definition Language](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenddl_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") (DDL) used to define CDS entities. The artifacts in question have some technical differences however: BDL artifacts are managed by ABAP Compiler. This means ABAP Compiler is responsible for syntax checks and semantic checks and for generating the [behavior definitions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencds_behavior_definitions.htm).

CDS BDL - IMPLEMENTATION

\* Work in progress \*

Syntax

implementation unmanaged*|*managed*|*abstract *\[*in class class\_name unique*\]*;

Effect

The implementation type of the [business object behavior](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrap_bo_behavior_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is introduced in the [behavior definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencds_behavior_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") using the keyword implementation.

Implementation types can be split into the following categories:

-   unmanaged
    In the case of the implementation type unmanaged, all important components of the REST contract must be implemented first. All required operations (the [standard operations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbdl_standard_operations.htm) create, update, and delete plus any application-specific [actions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbdl_action.htm)) must be defined in the relevant behavior definition before being implemented in ABAP. This implementation type is best used when using existing legacy business logic for [behavior implementation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbehavior_implement_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

-   managed
    The implementation type managed is best used when implementing completely new business logic. In this case, a behavior definition is sufficient to obtain a ready-to-run business object.

-   abstract
    A behavior definition with the implementation type abstract cannot be implemented using [behavior pools](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbehavior_pool_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and is used as a metadata-only artifact in the representation of external services instead.

A behavior definition can specify one or more classes which allow the behavior implementation of a business object. This can be done by using the addition [in class ... unique](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbdl_in_class_unique.htm) in the behavior definition of the business object.

Effect of in class ... unique:

-   A behavior for the entity in question can only be implemented in a behavior pool with the specified name. Any other class that attempts this raises an ABAP Compiler error.

-   If the addition in class ... unique is specified, an operation must not be implemented multiple times in different [handler classes](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabp_handler_class.htm).

Example

In the following example, the data from the ABAP flight data reference scenario (or flight data scenario for short) is used. It represents a legacy business logic that can be used to create and process flight bookings. The CDS view /DMO/I\_Travel represents the root node of the business object for managing flight trips. The underlying business model is described in CDS BDL - Example.

The following example shows the behavior definition for the root entity Travel. In the example, the implementation type is set to unmanaged because the existing legacy business logic needs to be integrated into the new application for managing flight trips.

implementation unmanaged;
define behavior for /DMO/I\_Travel alias Travel
{
¬†¬†create;
¬†¬†update;
¬†¬†delete;
}

Similarly to CDS entities, the [behavior](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrap_bo_behavior_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") for an entity can be divided into a part for once-only specifications (implementation, late numbering, etag, and lock), followed by a part of multiple specifications (field, standard operations, actions, and associations) enclosed in {...}.

Example

In the following example, the data from the ABAP flight data reference scenario (or flight data scenario for short) is used. It represents a legacy business logic that can be used to create and process flight bookings. The CDS view /DMO/I\_Travel represents the root node of the business object for managing flight trips. The underlying business model is described in CDS BDL - Example.

The following example shows the behavior definition for the root entity Travel.

implementation unmanaged;
define behavior for /DMO/I\_Travel alias Travel
late numbering
lock master
etag LastChangedAt
{
¬†¬†field (read only) Travel\_ID;
¬†¬†field (mandatory) Agency\_ID, Customer\_ID, Begin\_Date, End\_Date;

CDS BDL - DEFINE BEHAVIOR, alias

\* Work in progress \*

Syntax

... alias AliasName

Effect

Behavior Definition Language ([CDS BDL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencds_bdl_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")) makes it possible to define an alias name AliasName for a CDS entity.

A BDL alias for an entity makes it possible to introduce a alias name for a CDS entity. This name can be clearer than the entity name itself, since it does not need to be uniquely global in [ABAP Dictionary](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_dictionary_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

The alias name is visible in the method syntax of the [behavior implementation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_behavior_pools.htm) of the business object and in the [derived types](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrpm_derived_types.htm).

The length of an alias name AliasName is restricted to 20 characters.

Example

In the following example, the data from the ABAP flight data reference scenario (short: flight data scenario) is used. It represents a legacy business logic that can be used to create and process flight bookings. The CDS view /DMO/I\_Travel represents the root node of the business object for managing air travel. The underlying data is described in CDS BDL - Example.

The following example shows the behavior definition for the root entity Travel. The business object whose CDS data model is represented by the root entity /DMO/I\_Travel can be given an alias, in this instance Travel.

CDS BDL - DEFINE BEHAVIOR, in class unique

\* Work in progress \*

Syntax

... *\[*implementation*\]* in class ClassName unique

Effect

A behavior definition can specify one or more [global classes](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabp_global_class.htm) that allow the behavior implementation of a business object. This can be specified in two places:

-   In the header of the business object behavior definition.

implementation unmanaged*|*managed in class ClassName unique;
¬†¬†define behavior for CDSEntityName alias AliasName
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†...
or

-   In the behavior definition of each CDS entity.

implementation unmanaged*|*managed;
¬†¬†define behavior for CDSEntityName alias AliasName
¬†¬†¬†¬†implementation in class ClassName unique
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†...

A specification for each business object applies to all entities that do not have their own specification for define behavior (that is, a definition for a single entity overwrites the definition for each business object).

Effect of specifying in class ClassName unique:

-   Behavior for the entity in question can only be implemented in a [behavior pool](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbehavior_pool_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") with the specified name ClassName. Any other class that attempts this raises an ABAP Compiler error.

-   An operation (a [standard operation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbdl_standard_operations.htm) or an [action](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbdl_action.htm)) must not be implemented multiple times in different [handler classes](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabp_handler_class.htm). Each operation on an entity can be implemented no more than once

CDS BDL - DEFINE BEHAVIOR, late numbering

\* Work in progress \*

Syntax

... late numbering *\[*in place*\]*

Effect

Late numbering is a concept for gapless assignments of unique keys when creating new entity instances. New entity instances are given their final key shortly before the [RAP business object](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrap_bo_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is saved. Until this moment, the application logic uses a temporary key that has to be replaced when the business object data is saved.

The addition in place indicates that a CDS entity uses its own key fields for late numbering. These key fields are written to the special values, which are identified as temporary. This means that the [derived types](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrpm_derived_types.htm) for the entity do not contain an additional field [%PID](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencomponents_derived_types.htm). The task when assigning the keys (TYPE TABLE FOR MAPPED) therefore is to map from a temporary key to the final key and not to map from a %PID to the final key. This means that the mapped structure contains the entity key fields twice, once as a component %TMP and once as a component [%KEY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencomponents_derived_types.htm).

Late numbering must be applied by implementing the method [adjust\_numbers()](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abensaver_adjust_numbers.htm) of the local [saver class](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabp_saver_class.htm) that is part of the [behavior implementation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbehavior_implement_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). When declared in the [behavior definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencds_behavior_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the entity, late numbering causes the runtime to call the method adjust\_numbers() at the time in question. This implementation is then responsible for assigning the final keys and passing them to the method parameter mapped.

Remarks

-   The parameter mapped is used to pass the final keys to the framework and hence replace the temporary keys. Ideally, this replacement action is decoupled from the actual saving of the data but many legacy applications determine their keys when the data is saved. In these cases, it is best to implement the save logic in adjust\_numbers() and leave the method [save](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abensaver_method_save.htm) itself empty.

-   Late numbering modifies the derived types: The tables mapped, reported, and failed are given the additional field %PID to hold a temporary key.

Example

In the following example, the data from the ABAP flight data reference scenario (or flight data scenario for short) is used. It represents a legacy business logic that can be used to create and process flight bookings. The CDS view /DMO/I\_Travel represents the root node of the business object for managing flight trips. The underlying business model is described in CDS BDL - Example.

The following example shows the behavior definition for the root entity Travel.

implementation unmanaged;
define behavior for /DMO/I\_Travel alias Travel

{
¬†¬†create;
¬†¬†update;
¬†¬†delete;
¬†¬†action set\_status\_booked result \[1\] $self;

CDS BDL - DEFINE BEHAVIOR, etag

\* Work in progress \*

Syntax

... etag field|AncestorEntity~Field ( LocalField = MasterField )

Effect

The etag field field of an entity is used for locks in the OData protocol. It references either the entity itself or the parent entity AncestorEntity for which a foreign key relationship LocalField = MasterField must be specified.

A field flagged as an entity tag (ETag) field field is typically used to describe, uniquely, the state of a requested resource (for example a specific entity instance). Any changes made to the requested resource update the etag field. Often fields containing time stamps, check sums, or version numbers are used for this.

In the [behavior implementation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbehavior_implement_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), the method [read](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhandler_method_read.htm) of the [handler class](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabp_handler_class.htm) is called, which then requests the current ETag for the resource as shown in the following example. The process flow is as follows:

-   If an entity has an ETag field in its [behavior definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencds_behavior_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), a write operation (such as update) passes an if match header with the value of the ETag in the query and hence informs the framework of the expected state.

-   The method read then checks whether the requested resource exists in a buffered state or, if not, whether it needs to be read from the database.

-   The value of the ETag is then passed to the framework using the output parameters of the read method.

-   The framework checks both values and calls the write operation only if they match.

Note

An ETag can be used for optimistic locks in shared OData protocol access, where it prevents simultaneous updates on a resource from overwriting each other.

Example

In the following example, the data from the ABAP flight data reference scenario (or flight data scenario for short) is used. It represents a legacy business logic that can be used to create and process flight bookings. The CDS view /DMO/I\_Travel represents the root node of the business object for managing flight trips. The underlying business model is described in CDS BDL - Example.

CDS BDL - DEFINE BEHAVIOR, lock

\* Work in progress \*

Syntax

... lock master*|*dependent ( LocalField = MasterField )

Effect

A behavior definition can specify the following for an entity:

-   The entity supports direct locks (by specifying the entity property lock master)
    or

-   the entity is dependent on the lock status of a parent entity or root entity (by specifying the entity property lock dependent).

A foreign key relationship must be defined for any lock dependencies. This relationship describes which field in the child entity references which field in the parent entity, expressed using LocalField = MasterField in BDL syntax.

Remarks [ABAP RAP](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_rap_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") supports lock master for root nodes of the [RAP business object](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrap_bo_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") only.

-   The lock property is only relevant for those entities that provide change operations (such as update).

Example

In the following example, the data from the ABAP flight data reference scenario (or flight data scenario for short) is used. It represents a legacy business logic that can be used to create and process flight bookings. The CDS view /DMO/I\_Travel represents the root node of the business object for managing flight trips. The underlying business model is described in CDS BDL - Example.

Commas can be used to classify multiple fields, Field1, Field2, Field3, ... in the same way:

field(read only) Field1, Field2, Field3;

field(mandatory) Field4, Field5;

Example

In the following example, the data from the ABAP flight data reference scenario (or flight data scenario for short) is used. It represents a legacy business logic that can be used to create and process flight bookings. The CDS view /DMO/I\_Travel represents the root node of the business object for managing flight trips. The underlying business model is described in CDS BDL - Example.

The following example shows the behavior definition for the root entity Travel.

implementation unmanaged;
define behavior for /DMO/I\_Travel alias Travel

¬†¬†field (read only) Travel\_ID;
¬†¬†field (mandatory) Agency\_ID, Customer\_ID, Begin\_Date, End\_Date;

CDS BDL - DEFINE BEHAVIOR, Standard Operations

\* Work in progress \*

Syntax

... *\[*internal*\]* create;
¬†¬†¬†¬†*\[*internal*\]* update;
¬†¬†¬†¬†*\[*internal*\]* delete;

Effect

The standard operations create, update, and delete (known as the CRUD operations) are the most important operations for the transactional behavior of a [RAP business object](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrap_bo_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The operations create, update, and delete must be declared appropriately in the [behavior definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencds_behavior_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") for an entity whenever an entity is created, updated, or deleted.

A standard operation can be given the addition internal. This makes it possible to implement the action without making it consumable from outside. Example: internal update;

CRUD operations can be made available for an entity simply by declaring them in the body of the entity in question.

The [behavior](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrap_bo_behavior_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") for the operations create, update, and delete is implemented in the method [FOR MODIFY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhandler_method_modify.htm) of the [handler class](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabp_handler_class.htm).

Note

The [FOR LOCK](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhandler_method_lock.htm) method of the handler class is called automatically before a change operation (such as update) is triggered. However, the corresponding entity must have the lock property in its behavior definition.

Example

In the following example, the data from the ABAP flight data reference scenario (or flight data scenario for short) is used. It represents a legacy business logic that can be used to create and process flight bookings. The CDS view /DMO/I\_Travel represents the root node of the business object for managing flight trips. The underlying business model is described in CDS BDL - Example.

The following example shows the behavior definition for the root entity Travel.

implementation unmanaged;
define behavior for /DMO/I\_Travel alias Travel
lock master
{
¬†¬†create;
¬†¬†update;
¬†¬†delete;
}

The transactional behavior of the business object is defined by the standard operations create, update, and delete. These operations are [implemented](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_behavior_pools.htm) in the association [behavior pools](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbehavior_pool_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

CDS BDL - DEFINE BEHAVIOR, action

\* Work in progress \*

Syntax

... *\[*internal*\]* *\[*static*\]* action ActionName
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† *\[*external LongName*\]*
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† *\[*parameter InputParameterEntity*|*$self*\]*
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† *\[*result cardinality OutputParameterEntity*|*$self*\]*;

Effect

In behavior definitions, actions can be specified as application-specific operations. Actions can either reference an instance (the default case, without the keyword static) or they can be static (with the keyword static).

An action can also be given the keyword internal. This makes it possible to implement the action without making it consumable from outside.

Input and output parameters are optional. Actions can pass CDS entities as input parameters (InputParameterEntity) and as output parameters (OutputParameterEntity). The CDS entity can be a regular CDS view or a CDS abstract entity. If InputParameterEntity and OutputParameterEntity are also the entity for which the action is executed, only the predefined keyword $self is required. In this case, the keyword stands for the type of the entity itself.

InputParameterEntity can be any type defined in ABAP Dictionary or ABAP CDS. OData accepts structured types only. EML can also handle elementary types.

An instance action is always multi-instance-enabled. The result [cardinality](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencardinality_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in instance actions specifies whether an input instance points to 0..1, 1, 0..n, or 1..n instances. The potential cardinality values are therefore as follows: \[0..1\], \[1\], \[0..\*\] or \[1..\*\].

An action can also be given an external name. Here is one example:

action ActionName external 'AVeryLongExternalActionName'
¬†¬†¬†¬† result \[0..1\] OutputParameter;

The external name can be up to 128 characters long. It will only be exposed in the OData metadata. It is ignored within ABAP, for example the action cannot be addressed in [Entity Manipulation Language](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeneml.htm) using the external name.

Note

The BDL syntax specifies that a maximum of one input parameter and a maximum of one output parameter can be specified. If an action requires more than one input or output, a CDS structure type or an abstract entity can be used with components for each input or output.

Example

In the following example, the data from the ABAP flight data reference scenario (short: flight data scenario) is used. It models a legacy business logic that can be used to create and process flight bookings. The CDS view /DMO/I\_Travel represents the root node of the business object for managing air travel.

The following example shows the behavior definition for the root entity Travel.

implementation unmanaged;
define behavior for /DMO/I\_Travel alias Travel
{
¬†¬†create;
¬†¬†update;
¬†¬†delete;
¬†¬†action set\_status\_booked result \[1\] $self;
}

The transactional [behavior](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrap_bo_behavior_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the [RAP business object](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrap_bo_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") travel is defined by the [standard operations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbdl_standard_operations.htm) create, update, and delete plus one action. The end user can use the action set\_status\_booked to set the status of a trip to booked. The action set\_status\_booked is bound to an instance of the type travel, which in this case is also returned by the action. This means the cardinality equals \[1\] and $self is set as the type of the output parameter.

CDS BDL - DEFINE BEHAVIOR, association

\* Work in progress \*

Syntax

... *\[*internal*\]* association AssociationName
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† *\[*abbreviation AbbreviationName*\]* {*\[**\[*internal*\]*create;*\]*};

Effect

An important behavior part of an entity is the transactional enabling of its associations. This affects both reads (Read-By-Association) and creates (Create-By-Association) along CDS associations. Here, the associations in question must be specified explicitly in the behavior definition.

To activate reads for an association, either the statement association AssociationName; or association AssociationName {} can be used.

The keyword {create;} is used to declare that instances of the associated entity can be created along the association. Example: association \_Booking { create; }

An association can be given the addition internal. This makes it possible to implement the action without making it consumable from outside. This affects both read and create actions along CDS associations. Example: internal association \_Booking { create; }

If the create action is internally activated (it can be implemented but is not consumable), the operation create can be given the addition internal. Example: association \_Booking { internal create; }

The addition abbreviation defines an alternative name, in a similar way to alias for entities. AbbreviationName is not an alias, however, which is why a different keyword is used here. Associations are in the namespace of their root entity, which is why their names are usually easy to read and no more than 30 characters long. This is too long for [ABAP RAP](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_rap_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), since certain component names are created by concatenating association names and default suffixes. This why an abbreviation AbbreviationName must be defined if the name of the association in the CDS view exceeds the length of 11 characters.

Example

In the following example, the data from the ABAP flight data reference scenario (short: flight data scenario) is used. It represents a legacy business logic that can be used to create and process flight bookings. The CDS view /DMO/I\_Travel represents the root node of the business object for managing air travel. The underlying data is described in CDS BDL - Example.

The following example shows the behavior definition for the root entity Travel.

implementation unmanaged;
define behavior for /DMO/I\_Travel alias Travel
{
¬†¬†create;
¬†¬†update;
¬†¬†delete;
¬†¬†association \_Booking { create; }
}

The association \_Booking specifies that new instances of the child entity Booking can be created for a specific instance of the entity Travel only. The keyword { create; } indicates that this assignment is activated for the standard operation create. Therefore, booking instances can only be created using a travel instance Travel.

Effect

Similarly to CDS entities, the [behavior](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrap_bo_behavior_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") for an entity can be divided into a part for once-only specifications (implementation, late numbering, etag, and lock), followed by a part of multiple specifications (field, standard operations, actions, and associations) enclosed in {...}.

Example

In the following example, the data from the ABAP flight data reference scenario (or flight data scenario for short) is used. It represents a legacy business logic that can be used to create and process flight bookings. The CDS view /DMO/I\_Travel represents the root node of the business object for managing flight trips.

CDS BDL

\* Work in progress \*

The transactional behavior of a CDS entity is modeled using the Behavior Definition Language (BDL).

BDL describes the functions and properties of one or more [RAP business object](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrap_bo_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") nodes, such as

-   the [standard operations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbdl_standard_operations.htm) create, update, and delete (the CRUD operations),

-   application-specific operations ([actions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbdl_action.htm)),

-   definition of a [lock property](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbdl_lock.htm) for modifying operations on business object nodes, including the option of propagating locks to child nodes (known as a lock master/lock dependent relationship).

Read Positions

At a read position, the content of an operand is read but not changed when the statement is executed. Data objects can be specified as follows at read positions:

-   Specification of a [literal](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenliteral_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
    

-   Specification of a [data object visible](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenlifetime_and_visibility.htm) at this position using the identifier dobj, a [field symbol](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenfield_symbol_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") <fs>, or a data reference dref->\* dereferenced using the [dereferencing operator](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendereferencing_operat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") \->\* if dref is typed completely.
    Here, the identifiers of data objects also include the specification of [text symbols](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abentext_symbol_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") using the following:
    ... text-idf ...,
    Here, idf is the three-character ID of the text symbol or chaining of reference variables. If a field symbol is used, it must be assigned to a memory area and a data reference must point to a data object, otherwise an uncatchable exception is raised. As an alternative to specifying a text symbol using text-idf, the three-character ID of a text symbol can also be appended to the [text field literal](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abentext_field_literal_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in parentheses:
    ... '...'(idf) ...
    If the text symbol exists in the currently loaded [text pool](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abentext_pool_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), then the content of the corresponding text symbol is used instead of the text field literal, otherwise the literal is used.

-   If the data object is an internal table, the expressions dobj\[\], <fs>\[\], or dref->\*\[\] can also be used. An exception to this is specification of the internal table of a [table expression](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abentable_expression_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), where \[\] cannot be appended to the name. When specifying dobj\[\], this guarantees that the [table body](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abentable_body_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is addressed and no possible [header lines](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenheader_line_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). If an internal table does not have a header line, its very name dobj (without \[\]) is interpreted as the table body in all operand positions. However, if an internal table does have a header line, its very name dobj (without \[\]) is interpreted as the header line and not as the table body in almost all operand positions. The operand positions in which the name of an internal table with a header line is interpreted as the internal table are listed in [internal tables with headers](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenitab_header_line.htm).

-   Specification of a [subarea](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenoffset_length.htm) of a character-like or byte-like data object -or a character-like initial part of a structure- by specifying an [offset/length](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenoffset_length_specific_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

-   At some positions, numeric values must be specified directly as digits. In contrast to [numeric literals](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abennumeric_literal_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), it is often not possible to specify a plus/minus sign. Examples are numbers specified in declarative statements for the length of elementary data objects or for the initial memory requirements of internal tables.

Hints

-   Text symbols cannot be listed at all read positions. For example, they are not allowed for specifying the target of dynamic [executions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_execution.htm).

-   A [system field](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abensystem_field_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") should only be specified as an operand in a read position if its content is not set by the same statement. Otherwise, this can lead to undefined system behavior.

-   The predicate expressions [IS ASSIGNED](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenlogexp_assigned.htm) and [IS BOUND](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenlogexp_assigned.htm) can be used to check the usability of field symbols and data references.

-   A data reference variable with a generic static type can only be deserialized using the statement [ASSIGN dref->\* TO <fs>](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapassign_mem_area_dynamic_dobj.htm).

-   At many read positions, [functions or expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenoperands_expressions.htm) can be specified instead of data objects.

-   [Enumerated objects](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenenumerated_object_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") with an [enumerated type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenenumerated_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") can be used in all read positions in which the operand type is their enumerated type or in which the operand is converted to one of the character-like types c or string.

Write Positions

At a write position, the content of an operand is changed when the statement is executed. Only modifiable data objects (that is, no literals, text symbols, constants, or non-modifiable formal parameters) can be specified as follows at write positions:

-   Specification of a [visible data object](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenlifetime_and_visibility.htm) specified at this position using the identifier dobj, a field symbol <fs>, or a dereferenced data reference dref->\* if dref is typed completely. Like in [read positions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenreading_position_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), \[\] can be appended to internal tables to address the [table body](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abentable_body_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

-   Specification of a [subarea](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenoffset_length.htm) of a [flat](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenflat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") character-like or byte-like data object using an [offset/length](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenoffset_length_specific_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") specification. An offset or length specification can not be made in write positions for data objects of the [deep](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendeep_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") data types string and xstring.

-   At a [declaration position](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendeclaration_position_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), an [inline declaration](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeninline_declaration_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of a data object or field symbol can be made using a [declaration expression](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendeclaration_expression_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

-   [Writable expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenwritable_expression_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") can be listed in a [result position](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenresult_position_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

There are write-only positions, where an operand is overwritten without being read first, and write positions where an operand is read and written are both available.

Hints

-   In [some write positions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenexpression_positions_write.htm), certain expressions can also be specified.

-   [Enumerated variables](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenenumerated_variable_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") can only be used in write positions where the operand type is the enumerated type and only the associated [enumerated values](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenenumerated_value_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") can be written.

Substring Access

In operand positions, it is only possible to access subareas of certain data objects by specifying an offset or length:

Syntax

dobj*\[*+off*\]**\[*(len)*\]*

<fs>*\[*+off*\]**\[*(len)*\]*

dref->\**\[*+off*\]**\[*(len)*\]*

Effect

An offset or length specification is directly appended directly to the identifier dobj of the data object, an <fs> field symbol, or a dereferenced data reference variable dref->\*. Offsets or lengths can be specified for:

-   [Elementary](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenelementary_data_object_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [byte-like data objects](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbyte_like_data_object_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")

-   [Elementary](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenelementary_data_object_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [character-like data objects](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencharlike_data_object_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")

-   [Flat structures](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenflat_structure_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") where one of the following prerequisites must be met:

-   The structure only contains flat character-like components.

-   The first fragment of the [structural fragment view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenunicode_fragment_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is flat and character-like, and the substring addressed by specifying the offset and length is located within this fragment.

The following restrictions apply:

-   At [write positions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenwriting_position_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), only flat data objects are allowed, that is, write access to substrings of strings is not possible.

-   Access to substrings of strings is also not possible in the following [read positions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenreading_position_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"):

-   Specification of dobj*\[*+off*\]**\[*(len)*\]* as a memory area [mem\_area](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapassign_mem_area_static_dobj.htm) of the statement [ASSIGN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapassign.htm).

-   Specification of dobj*\[*+off*\]**\[*(len)*\]* as an argument of the statement [GET REFERENCE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapget_reference.htm) or of the reference operator [REF](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconstructor_expression_ref.htm).

-   Specification of dobj*\[*+off*\]**\[*(len)*\]* as an actual parameter for input parameters when calling [methods](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenmethod_calls.htm), [function modules](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall_function.htm) , and [subroutines](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapperform.htm) .

-   Offsets and lengths cannot be specified for literals or text symbols.

-   An offset/length specification cannot be attached directly to a table expression [itab\[ ... \]](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abentable_expressions.htm), but to a [chaining](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abentable_exp_chaining.htm) whose last position is a suitable structure component after a structure component selector.

-   No offset or length can be specified for an [enumerated object](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenenumerated_object_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") with an [enumerated type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenenumerated_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), regardless of the [base type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbase_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

-   In case of dynamically [specified operands](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenoperands_specifying.htm) in parentheses, no length specification can be made.

-   A dereferenced data reference variable dref->\* must be typed completely.

-   For a [writable expression](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenwritable_expression_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), no offsets or lengths can be specified as [memory areas](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapassign_mem_area_writable_exp.htm) of the statement ASSIGN or as arguments of the reference operator [REF](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconstructor_expression_ref.htm) (table expressions only).

The segment of the data object is used that has the offset specified in off and the length specified in len in characters or bytes. No memory area outside the field boundaries can be addressed, except for in the statement [ASSIGN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapassign.htm). In the case of an offset specification without a length, the entire substring is addressed from off characters; in the case of a length specification without an offset, the first len characters are addressed (different rules apply to the statement [ASSIGN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapassign.htm)).

The operands off and len expect data objects of the type i, which must contain positive integers, with the following exceptions.

-   The length 0 can be specified for [strings](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenstring_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

-   A negative offset, but never length 0, can be specified if an <fs> field symbol is specified in the statement [ASSIGN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapassign_mem_area_static_dobj.htm) for dobj.

-   If off is smaller than the length of dobj, an asterisk (\*) can be entered for len. The upper limit of dobj then determines the upper limit of the memory area.

If the prerequisites are not met, or if the subarea defined by off and len is not fully included in the data object, except in the case of [ASSIGN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapassign.htm), a syntax error occurs if statically identifiable. Otherwise, an exception of the class CX\_SY\_RANGE\_OUT\_OF\_BOUNDS is raised. If off is specified as a numeric literal, it cannot be preceded by a plus/minus sign.

The offset and length specifications are counted in characters for character-like data objects and otherwise in bytes.

A substring specified by an offset or length specification is treated like a data object of the specified length. The data type depends on the data type of the original data object, the field symbol, or the data reference variable, as shown below:

Original Data Type

Data Type of Substring

c

c

n

n

d

n

t

n

string

string

x

x

xstring

xstring

Structure type

c

In a substring access, if the length of the substring matches the length of the structure to a structure exactly, the substring does not have data type c but is handled like the structure itself.

Hints

Example

The following structure has character-like and non-character-like components:

DATA:
¬†¬†BEGIN OF struc,
¬†¬†¬†¬†a TYPE c LENGTH 3,¬†¬†¬†¬†"Length 3 characters
¬†¬†¬†¬†b TYPE n LENGTH 4,¬†¬†¬†¬†"Length 4 characters
¬†¬† ¬†c TYPE d,¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† "Length 8 characters
¬†¬†¬†¬†d TYPE t,¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† "Length 6 characters
¬†¬†¬†¬†e TYPE decfloat16,¬†¬†¬†¬†"Length 8 bytes

¬†¬†¬†¬†g TYPE x LENGTH 2,¬†¬†¬†¬†"Length 2 bytes
¬†¬†END OF struc.

The [fragment view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenunicode_fragment_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") splits the structure into five areas, F1 - F5.

Offset and length accesses are only possible on the character-like initial fragment F1 only, for example struc(21) or struc+7(14). An access such as struc+57(2) is not allowed.

Description

In the first part, the minutes of a time field are selected by specifying an offset. Then the minutes and seconds are set to their initial values by specifying an offset in the CLEAR statement.

In the second part, the five digit sequence 78901 from the field f2 is replaced with DEFGH from f1 by specifying offsets and lengths.

In the third part, assignments are used. First, the content of f1 is assigned to f2 without offset specifications. The same is then done with offsets and lengths for f1. The next three assignments overwrite the content of f2 with an offset of 2. Note that f2 is padded on the right with blanks, in accordance with the conversion rule for source type c.

In the fourth part, the WRITE TO statement is used. The first six digits of the field number are written to the last 12 digits of the string field as left-aligned, centered, and right-aligned places.

Substring Access

In operand positions, it is only possible to access subareas of certain data objects by specifying an offset or length:

Syntax

dobj*\[*+off*\]**\[*(len)*\]*

<fs>*\[*+off*\]**\[*(len)*\]*

dref->\**\[*+off*\]**\[*(len)*\]*

Effect

An offset or length specification is directly appended directly to the identifier dobj of the data object, an <fs> field symbol, or a dereferenced data reference variable dref->\*. Offsets or lengths can be specified for:

-   [Elementary](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenelementary_data_object_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [byte-like data objects](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbyte_like_data_object_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")

-   [Elementary](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenelementary_data_object_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [character-like data objects](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencharlike_data_object_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")

-   [Flat structures](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenflat_structure_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") where one of the following prerequisites must be met:

-   The structure only contains flat character-like components.

-   The first fragment of the [structural fragment view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenunicode_fragment_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is flat and character-like, and the substring addressed by specifying the offset and length is located within this fragment.

The following restrictions apply:

-   At [write positions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenwriting_position_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), only flat data objects are allowed, that is, write access to substrings of strings is not possible.

-   Access to substrings of strings is also not possible in the following [read positions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenreading_position_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"):

-   Specification of dobj*\[*+off*\]**\[*(len)*\]* as a memory area [mem\_area](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapassign_mem_area_static_dobj.htm) of the statement [ASSIGN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapassign.htm).

-   Specification of dobj*\[*+off*\]**\[*(len)*\]* as an argument of the statement [GET REFERENCE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapget_reference.htm) or of the reference operator [REF](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconstructor_expression_ref.htm).

-   Specification of dobj*\[*+off*\]**\[*(len)*\]* as an actual parameter for input parameters when calling [methods](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenmethod_calls.htm), [function modules](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall_function.htm) , and [subroutines](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapperform.htm) .

-   Offsets and lengths cannot be specified for literals or text symbols.

-   An offset/length specification cannot be attached directly to a table expression [itab\[ ... \]](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abentable_expressions.htm), but to a [chaining](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abentable_exp_chaining.htm) whose last position is a suitable structure component after a structure component selector.

-   No offset or length can be specified for an [enumerated object](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenenumerated_object_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") with an [enumerated type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenenumerated_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), regardless of the [base type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbase_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

-   In case of dynamically [specified operands](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenoperands_specifying.htm) in parentheses, no length specification can be made.

-   A dereferenced data reference variable dref->\* must be typed completely.

-   For a [writable expression](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenwritable_expression_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), no offsets or lengths can be specified as [memory areas](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapassign_mem_area_writable_exp.htm) of the statement ASSIGN or as arguments of the reference operator [REF](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconstructor_expression_ref.htm) (table expressions only).

The segment of the data object is used that has the offset specified in off and the length specified in len in characters or bytes. No memory area outside the field boundaries can be addressed, except for in the statement [ASSIGN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapassign.htm). In the case of an offset specification without a length, the entire substring is addressed from off characters; in the case of a length specification without an offset, the first len characters are addressed (different rules apply to the statement [ASSIGN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapassign.htm)).

The operands off and len expect data objects of the type i, which must contain positive integers, with the following exceptions.

-   The length 0 can be specified for [strings](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenstring_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

-   A negative offset, but never length 0, can be specified if an <fs> field symbol is specified in the statement [ASSIGN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapassign_mem_area_static_dobj.htm) for dobj.

-   If off is smaller than the length of dobj, an asterisk (\*) can be entered for len. The upper limit of dobj then determines the upper limit of the memory area.

If the prerequisites are not met, or if the subarea defined by off and len is not fully included in the data object, except in the case of [ASSIGN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapassign.htm), a syntax error occurs if statically identifiable. Otherwise, an exception of the class CX\_SY\_RANGE\_OUT\_OF\_BOUNDS is raised. If off is specified as a numeric literal, it cannot be preceded by a plus/minus sign.

The offset and length specifications are counted in characters for character-like data objects and otherwise in bytes.

A substring specified by an offset or length specification is treated like a data object of the specified length. The data type depends on the data type of the original data object, the field symbol, or the data reference variable, as shown below:

Original Data Type

Data Type of Substring

c

c

n

n

d

n

t

n

string

string

x

x

xstring

xstring

Structure type

c

In a substring access, if the length of the substring matches the length of the structure to a structure exactly, the substring does not have data type c but is handled like the structure itself.

Hints

-   For reads on substrings of character-like data objects, built-in [substring functions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abensubstring_functions.htm) that allow searches for substrings and offsets/lengths are also available. The substring functions can also be used to process arguments where offsets and lengths cannot be specified, such as data objects with an [enumerated type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenenumerated_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") because there is an implicit conversion to string.

-   A specification of dobj+0(\*), dobj+0, or dobj(\*) is always interpreted as dobj. In this case, dobj can also be a data object where substring access according to the rules above is not possible.

-   No substring access cnt(len), sum(len) can be performed on data objects named cnt and sum unless an offset is specified explicitly. The compiler always interprets such an entry as a [number](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcnt.htm) or [sum](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapsum.htm) of a field len in the group level processing of an [extract dataset](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenextract_dataset_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

-   [Obsolete syntax forms](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abentokenization_obsolete.htm) can still occur outside of classes in connection with substring accesses.

-   The statement [MOVE PERCENTAGE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmove_percentage.htm) represents an obsolete form of substring access.

Example

The following structure has character-like and non-character-like components:

DATA:
¬†¬†BEGIN OF struc,
¬†¬†¬†¬†a TYPE c LENGTH 3,¬†¬†¬†¬†"Length 3 characters
¬†¬†¬†¬†b TYPE n LENGTH 4,¬†¬†¬†¬†"Length 4 characters
¬†¬† ¬†c TYPE d,¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† "Length 8 characters
¬†¬†¬†¬†d TYPE t,¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† "Length 6 characters
¬†¬†¬†¬†e TYPE decfloat16,¬†¬†¬†¬†"Length 8 bytes
¬†¬†¬†¬†f TYPE c LENGTH 28,¬†¬† "Length 28 characters
¬†¬†¬†¬†g TYPE x LENGTH 2,¬†¬†¬†¬†"Length 2 bytes
¬†¬†END OF struc.

The [fragment view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenunicode_fragment_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") splits the structure into five areas, F1 - F5.

\[ aaa | bbbb | cccccccc | ddd | AAA | eeee | fffffffffffff | gg \]
\[¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†F1¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† |¬†¬†F2 |¬†¬†F3¬†¬†|¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† F4¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†| F5 \]

Offset and length accesses are only possible on the character-like initial fragment F1 only, for example struc(21) or struc+7(14). An access such as struc+57(2) is not allowed.

Function modules in function pools are the predecessor technology of public [methods](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenmethod_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in global classes.

Effect

Between the statements FUNCTION and ENDFUNCTION, the functionality of a [function module](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenfunction_module_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") func is implemented in a function pool. The function module and its interface are defined in the [ABAP Development Tools (ADT)](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenadt_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or in the [Function Builder](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenfunction_builder_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") tool . The function module interface defined in the Function Builder is automatically displayed in comment lines below the statement FUNCTION as [parameter\_interface](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenfunction.htm).

Within the function module, local data types and data objects can be declared. There is also access to the formal parameters of the function module and to the global data types and data objects of the function pool. A function module is called using the statement [CALL FUNCTION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall_function.htm).

Hint

The [predicate expression](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenpredicate_expression_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [IS SUPPLIED](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenlogexp_supplied.htm) can be used in the function module to determine whether an actual parameter has been specified for when a formal parameter is called.

Example

Implements a function module that reads data in a table-like formal parameter flight\_tab under the condition of an elementary formal parameter id. The [parameter interface](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenfunction.htm) defined in Function Builder is visible as a comment.

Function Module Interface

The [parameter interface](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenparameter_interface_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of a function module is defined in the Function Builder or in the [ABAP Development Tools (ADT)](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenadt_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). It comprises the definition of interface parameters and the specification of exceptions that can be raised by a function module. ADT uses an editor with statements in ABAP pseudo syntax and the Function Builder automatically creates comment lines below the statement [FUNCTION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapfunction.htm) in the source code of a function module , which represent the interface of the function module as follows:

Syntax

... *\[*IMPORTING [parameters](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenfunction_parameters.htm)*\]*
¬†¬†¬†¬†*\[*EXPORTING [parameters](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenfunction_parameters.htm)*\]*
¬†¬†¬†¬†*\[*TABLES [table\_parameters](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abaptables_parameters_obsolete.htm)*\]*
¬†¬†¬†¬†*\[*CHANGING [parameters](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenfunction_parameters.htm)*\]*
¬†¬†¬†¬†*\[**{*RAISING exc1*|*RESUMABLE(exc1) exc2*|*RESUMABLE(exc2) ...*}*
¬†¬†¬†¬†*|**{*EXCEPTIONS exc1 exc2 ...*}**\]*

The syntax and semantics of IMPORTING, EXPORTING, CHANGING, RAISING, and EXCEPTIONS mainly correspond to the definition of method interfaces with [*\[*CLASS-*\]*METHODS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods_general.htm). The additional option of defining table parameters using [TABLES](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abaptables_parameters_obsolete.htm) is obsolete.

Hint

In the [ABAP Development Tools](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenadt_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), in which there is no form-based Function Builder and the parameter interface of a function module is defined in an ABAP pseudo syntax. These statements are not compiled like genuine ABAP statements and are not subject to the regular ABAP syntax checks are not applied. They are interpreted like the form-based instructions of the classic Function Builder when a function module is generated.

Interface Parameters

The interface parameters are defined in the ADT in ABAP pseudo syntax and in the Function Builder on the corresponding tab pages .

-   IMPORTING parameters are input parameters. When the function module is called, a suitable actual parameter must be specified for each non-optional input parameter. The content of the actual parameter is passed to the input parameter when it is called. The content of an input parameter for which 'pass by reference' is defined cannot be changed in the function module.

-   EXPORTING parameters are output parameters. When the function module is called, a suitable actual parameter can be specified for each output parameter. The content of an output parameter that is defined for 'pass by value' is passed to the actual parameter if the function module is completed without errors. An output parameter that is defined for pass by reference is not initialized when the function module is called.

-   TABLES parameters are [obsolete table parameters](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abaptables_parameters_obsolete.htm).

-   CHANGING parameters are input and output parameters. When the function module is called, a suitable actual parameter must be specified for each non-optional input or output parameter. The content of the actual parameter is passed to the input/output parameter when it is called, and when the function module is completed, the content of the input/output parameter is passed to the actual parameter.

Hint

The formal parameters of a function module can be registered as [global parameters](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenglobal_parameters_obsolete.htm) in Function Builder. However, this is obsolete.

Exceptions

The exceptions of a function module are defined in the ADT in ABAP pseudo syntax or on the Exceptions tab in the Function Builder . When exception classes are selected, it is specified whether it is a declaration of a [class-based exceptions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenclass_based_exception_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or a [non-class-based exception](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenexceptions_non_class.htm). Class-based exceptions are represented in the above syntax by RAISING and non-class-based exceptions are represented by EXCEPTIONS.

-   The addition RAISING is used to declare class-based exceptions that can be propagated from the function module to the caller. Exceptions of the categories CX\_STATIC\_CHECK and CX\_DYNAMIC\_CHECK must be declared explicitly, otherwise a propagation leads to an interface violation. A violation of the interface raises the catchable exception CX\_SY\_NO\_HANDLER. Exceptions of the category CX\_NO\_CHECK are always declared implicitly with the addition RESUMABLE, but they can also be declared explicitly. The declaration of exceptions of the category CX\_STATIC\_CHECK is checked statically during syntax check. For exceptions of the category CX\_DYNAMIC\_CHECK, the check is not performed until runtime. For exceptions of the category CX\_NO\_CHECK no check is performed. In a function module in which class-based exceptions are declared using the addition RAISING, the obsolete statement [CATCH SYSTEM-EXCEPTIONS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcatch_sys.htm) cannot be used to handle [catchable runtime errors](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencatchable_runtime_error_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). Instead, the catchable exceptions assigned to the runtime errors are to be handled in a [TRY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abaptry.htm) control structure.
    The addition RESUMABLE declares an exception so that it can be propagated as a [resumable exception](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenresumable_exception_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), which is then also propagated as such. The addition has no effect on a non-resumable exception. If a resumable exception is propagated in RAISING without the additionRESUMABLE, it becomes non-resumable. If a superclass is declared as resumable, all of the simultaneously listed subclasses must also be declared as resumable.

-   The addition EXCEPTIONS is used to define a list of non-class-based exceptions that can be raised in the function module using the statements [RAISE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapraise_exception.htm) or [MESSAGE RAISING](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmessage_raising.htm). Exceptions defined in this way are bound to the function module -similar to formal parameters- and cannot be propagated. If such an exception is raised in a function module, and no return value was assigned to it with the identically named addition EXCEPTIONS of the statement [CALL FUNCTION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall_function.htm) during the call, a runtime error occur. In a function module in whose interface non-class-based exceptions are defined, the statement [RAISE EXCEPTION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapraise_exception_class.htm) or the addition [THROW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconditional_expression_result.htm) in a [conditional expression](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconditional_expressions.htm) cannot be used to raise class-based exceptions.

For class-based exceptions, the Resumable column can be selected in the Function Builder to mark a class-based exception as a [resumable exception](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenresumable_exception_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). This places the addition RESUMABLE behind RAISING in the syntax above.

Hints

-   For new developments, SAP recommends working with class-based exceptions that are independent of the concrete function module.

-   See also [Class-Based Exceptions in Procedures](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenexceptions_procedures.htm).

Properties of Interface Parameters

When an interface parameter p1, p2... is defined in the Function Builder, its properties are determined that are reflected in the syntax of parameters and [table\_parameters](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abaptables_parameters_obsolete.htm).

Syntax

... *{* VALUE(p1) *|* REFERENCE(p1) *}*
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† *\[* *{*TYPE *\[*REF TO*\]* type*}* *|* [like\_structure](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapfunction_typing_obsolete.htm)
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† *\[*OPTIONAL*|**{*DEFAULT def1*}**\]* *\]*
¬†¬†¬†¬†*{* VALUE(p2) *|* REFERENCE(p2) *}*
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† *\[* *{*TYPE *\[*REF TO*\]* type*}* *|* [like\_structure](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapfunction_typing_obsolete.htm)
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† *\[*OPTIONAL*|**{*DEFAULT def2*}**\]* *\]*
¬†¬†¬†¬†...

The syntax and semantics of VALUE, TYPE, OPTIONAL, and DEFAULT are mainly the same as in the definition of method interfaces with [*\[*CLASS-*\]*METHODS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods_parameters.htm). In addition, there is the obsolete option [like\_structure](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapfunction_typing_obsolete.htm) also exists, which uses LIKE or STRUCTURE to type interface parameters.

Type of Parameter Passing

There are two types of pass by parameters: [pass by reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenpass_by_reference_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and [pass by value](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenpass_by_value_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). Pass by value is selected in the Function Builder by selecting pass by value and differs from pass by reference in the above syntax that is indicated by REFERENCE( ) through the specification of VALUE( ). If only one name p1 p2 ... is specified, the parameter is passed by reference by default.

-   In pass by reference, the formal parameter points directly to the actual parameter, so that changes to the formal parameters have an immediate effect on the actual parameter.

-   In pass by value, the formal parameter is created as a copy of the actual parameter (in IMPORTING and CHANGING parameters) or as an initial parameter (in EXPORTING parameters) on the stack when the function module is called and for CHANGING and EXPORTING parameters, the formal parameter is copied to the actual parameter when returning from the function module.

Note the following for the different types of parameter:

-   In IMPORTING, EXPORTING, and CHANGING parameters, pass by reference and pass by value are possible; for [TABLES parameters](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abaptables_parameters_obsolete.htm), only pass by reference is possible.

-   IMPORTING parameters passed by reference must not be overwritten in the function module.

-   An EXPORTING parameter passed by reference behaves like a CHANGING parameter, that is, EXPORTING parameters passed by reference are not initialized when the function module is called. Therefore, no read access to these parameters should take place before the first write access. In addition, one must be careful when adding content to such parameters as, for example, when inserting lines into internal tables.

Hint

The time the function module was last edited specifies whether a parameter passed by reference is shown with or without REFERENCE( ). REFERENCE( ) is shown for function modules that have been modified since Release 7.31.

Typing of Interface Parameters

The parameter interface of a function module is public throughout the system. Interface parameters can therefore only be typed with reference to data types from the ABAP Dictionary or from the public visibility section of global classes. Interface parameters can be typed using TYPE, TYPE REF TO or [LIKE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapfunction_typing_obsolete.htm).

Typing with TYPE *\[*REF TO*\]* is the only recommended typing for interface parameters of function modules. It takes place when TYPE or TYPE REF TO is used in the Function Builder . For IMPORTING, EXPORTING, and CHANGING parameters, any [built-in ABAP type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbuilt_in_types.htm) (complete or generic), or any data type of the ABAP Dictionary or from the public visibility section of a global class can be specified after TYPE. After TYPE REF TO, the generic data type [data](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbuilt_in_types_generic.htm), a non-generic data type, or an [object type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenobject_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") can be specified, and the interface parameter is typed as a [reference variable](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenreference_variable_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The [typing check](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abentyping_check.htm) is performed in the same way as for methods.

Hint

Without an explicit typing, a formal parameter is typed implicitly with the fully generic type any.

Optional Parameters

IMPORTING, CHANGING, and [TABLES parameters](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abaptables_parameters_obsolete.htm) can be made optional by using optional in the Function Builder . EXPORTING parameters are always optional. IMPORTING and CHANGING parameters can be assigned a replacement parameter (default value in the Function Builder) . In the above syntax, this is expressed using the additions OPTIONAL or DEFAULT. For an optional parameter, no actual parameter must be specified when the function module is called. While a formal parameter with the addition OPTIONAL is then initialized as a type-compliant parameter, a formal parameter with the addition DEFAULT assumes the value and type of the replacement parameter def1 def2 ...

If no actual parameter is specified for a generically typed formal parameter with the addition OPTIONAL when it is called, the type of the formal parameter is completed according to [fixed rules](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abentyping_generic.htm).

Hint

Within a function module, the [predicate expression](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenpredicate_expression_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [IS SUPPLIED](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenlogexp_supplied.htm) can be used to check whether an optional formal parameter was assigned an actual parameter when it was called.

Function Module Interface

The [parameter interface](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenparameter_interface_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of a function module is defined in the Function Builder or in the [ABAP Development Tools (ADT)](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenadt_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). It comprises the definition of interface parameters and the specification of exceptions that can be raised by a function module. ADT uses an editor with statements in ABAP pseudo syntax and the Function Builder automatically creates comment lines below the statement [FUNCTION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapfunction.htm) in the source code of a function module , which represent the interface of the function module as follows:

Syntax

... *\[*IMPORTING [parameters](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenfunction_parameters.htm)*\]*
¬†¬†¬†¬†*\[*EXPORTING [parameters](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenfunction_parameters.htm)*\]*
¬†¬†¬†¬†*\[*TABLES [table\_parameters](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abaptables_parameters_obsolete.htm)*\]*
¬†¬†¬†¬†*\[*CHANGING [parameters](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenfunction_parameters.htm)*\]*
¬†¬†¬†¬†*\[**{*RAISING exc1*|*RESUMABLE(exc1) exc2*|*RESUMABLE(exc2) ...*}*
¬†¬†¬†¬†*|**{*EXCEPTIONS exc1 exc2 ...*}**\]*

The syntax and semantics of IMPORTING, EXPORTING, CHANGING, RAISING, and EXCEPTIONS mainly correspond to the definition of method interfaces with [*\[*CLASS-*\]*METHODS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods_general.htm). The additional option of defining table parameters using [TABLES](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abaptables_parameters_obsolete.htm) is obsolete.

Hint

In the [ABAP Development Tools](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenadt_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), in which there is no form-based Function Builder and the parameter interface of a function module is defined in an ABAP pseudo syntax. These statements are not compiled like genuine ABAP statements and are not subject to the regular ABAP syntax checks are not applied. They are interpreted like the form-based instructions of the classic Function Builder when a function module is generated.

Interface Parameters

The interface parameters are defined in the ADT in ABAP pseudo syntax and in the Function Builder on the corresponding tab pages .

-   IMPORTING parameters are input parameters. When the function module is called, a suitable actual parameter must be specified for each non-optional input parameter. The content of the actual parameter is passed to the input parameter when it is called. The content of an input parameter for which 'pass by reference' is defined cannot be changed in the function module.

-   EXPORTING parameters are output parameters. When the function module is called, a suitable actual parameter can be specified for each output parameter. The content of an output parameter that is defined for 'pass by value' is passed to the actual parameter if the function module is completed without errors. An output parameter that is defined for pass by reference is not initialized when the function module is called.

-   TABLES parameters are [obsolete table parameters](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abaptables_parameters_obsolete.htm).

-   CHANGING parameters are input and output parameters. When the function module is called, a suitable actual parameter must be specified for each non-optional input or output parameter. The content of the actual parameter is passed to the input/output parameter when it is called, and when the function module is completed, the content of the input/output parameter is passed to the actual parameter.

Hint

The formal parameters of a function module can be registered as [global parameters](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenglobal_parameters_obsolete.htm) in Function Builder. However, this is obsolete.

Exceptions

The exceptions of a function module are defined in the ADT in ABAP pseudo syntax or on the Exceptions tab in the Function Builder . When exception classes are selected, it is specified whether it is a declaration of a [class-based exceptions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenclass_based_exception_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or a [non-class-based exception](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenexceptions_non_class.htm). Class-based exceptions are represented in the above syntax by RAISING and non-class-based exceptions are represented by EXCEPTIONS.

-   The addition RAISING is used to declare class-based exceptions that can be propagated from the function module to the caller. Exceptions of the categories CX\_STATIC\_CHECK and CX\_DYNAMIC\_CHECK must be declared explicitly, otherwise a propagation leads to an interface violation. A violation of the interface raises the catchable exception CX\_SY\_NO\_HANDLER. Exceptions of the category CX\_NO\_CHECK are always declared implicitly with the addition RESUMABLE, but they can also be declared explicitly. The declaration of exceptions of the category CX\_STATIC\_CHECK is checked statically during syntax check. For exceptions of the category CX\_DYNAMIC\_CHECK, the check is not performed until runtime. For exceptions of the category CX\_NO\_CHECK no check is performed. In a function module in which class-based exceptions are declared using the addition RAISING, the obsolete statement [CATCH SYSTEM-EXCEPTIONS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcatch_sys.htm) cannot be used to handle [catchable runtime errors](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencatchable_runtime_error_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). Instead, the catchable exceptions assigned to the runtime errors are to be handled in a [TRY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abaptry.htm) control structure.
    The addition RESUMABLE declares an exception so that it can be propagated as a [resumable exception](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenresumable_exception_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), which is then also propagated as such. The addition has no effect on a non-resumable exception. If a resumable exception is propagated in RAISING without the additionRESUMABLE, it becomes non-resumable. If a superclass is declared as resumable, all of the simultaneously listed subclasses must also be declared as resumable.

-   The addition EXCEPTIONS is used to define a list of non-class-based exceptions that can be raised in the function module using the statements [RAISE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapraise_exception.htm) or [MESSAGE RAISING](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmessage_raising.htm). Exceptions defined in this way are bound to the function module -similar to formal parameters- and cannot be propagated. If such an exception is raised in a function module, and no return value was assigned to it with the identically named addition EXCEPTIONS of the statement [CALL FUNCTION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall_function.htm) during the call, a runtime error occur. In a function module in whose interface non-class-based exceptions are defined, the statement [RAISE EXCEPTION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapraise_exception_class.htm) or the addition [THROW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconditional_expression_result.htm) in a [conditional expression](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconditional_expressions.htm) cannot be used to raise class-based exceptions.

For class-based exceptions, the Resumable column can be selected in the Function Builder to mark a class-based exception as a [resumable exception](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenresumable_exception_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). This places the addition RESUMABLE behind RAISING in the syntax above.

Hints

-   For new developments, SAP recommends working with class-based exceptions that are independent of the concrete function module.

-   See also [Class-Based Exceptions in Procedures](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenexceptions_procedures.htm).

Effect

Between the statements FUNCTION and ENDFUNCTION, the functionality of a [function module](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenfunction_module_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") func is implemented in a function pool. The function module and its interface are defined in the [ABAP Development Tools (ADT)](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenadt_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or in the [Function Builder](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenfunction_builder_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") tool . The function module interface defined in the Function Builder is automatically displayed in comment lines below the statement FUNCTION as [parameter\_interface](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenfunction.htm).

Within the function module, local data types and data objects can be declared. There is also access to the formal parameters of the function module and to the global data types and data objects of the function pool. A function module is called using the statement [CALL FUNCTION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall_function.htm).

Hint

The [predicate expression](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenpredicate_expression_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [IS SUPPLIED](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenlogexp_supplied.htm) can be used in the function module to determine whether an actual parameter has been specified for when a formal parameter is called.

Example

Implements a function module that reads data in a table-like formal parameter flight\_tab under the condition of an elementary formal parameter id. The [parameter interface](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenfunction.htm) defined in Function Builder is visible as a comment.

Built-In Functions

ABAP provides a set of built-in functions. A built-in function returns a return value for one or more arguments. There are functions with exactly one unnamed argument and functions with one or more named arguments.

Built-in functions can be called functionally in [certain operand positions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenoperands_expressions.htm). When a built-in function is called in an [operand position](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenexpression_positions.htm), the function is executed before the operand is used and the return value of the built-in function is used as the operand, in accordance with its data type.

Built-In Functions, Syntax

-   [Functions with an Unnamed Argument](#abenbuilt-in-functions-syntax-1--------functions-with-named-arguments---@ITOC@@ABENBUILT_IN_FUNCTIONS_SYNTAX_2)

In functions with named arguments, there is usually a main argument val and with the option of further also optional arguments. The following sections show the general syntax for calling built-in functions.

Functions with an Unnamed Argument

Syntax

... func( arg ) ...

In functions with an unnamed argument, the syntax is the same as the syntax for calling functional methods with an input parameter. func is the built-in function and the argument arg is an operand whose data type matches the function. The blanks after the opening parentheses and before the closing parentheses are relevant.

Example

The built-in function [line\_exists](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenline_exists_function.htm) has an unnamed argument that expects a table expression.

DATA itab TYPE TABLE OF i WITH EMPTY KEY.
...
IF line\_exists( itab\[ 1 \] ).
¬†¬†...
ENDIF.

Functions with Named Arguments

Syntax

... func( val = arg p1 = arg1 p2 = arg2 ... ) ...

Functions with one or more named arguments, these are bound to [keyword parameters](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenkeyword_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in the same way as when functional methods are called with multiple input parameters. Operands can be specified for the arguments whose data type matches the corresponding parameter. The blanks after the opening parentheses and before the closing parentheses are relevant. If such a function has only one argument, or if only the main argument is to be supplied, the syntax can be simplified as follows:

... func( arg ) ... literal

Example

The built-in function [condense](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencondense_functions.htm) has named arguments and can, for example, be called as follows.

DATA(str1) = condense( \`...\` ).
DATA(str2) = condense( val = \`...\` ).
DATA(str3) = condense( val = \`...\`¬†¬†del = \` \` ).

Built-In Functions, Overview

The following tables summarize the built-in functions by purpose. Built-in functions are generally [processing functions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprocess_function_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or [description functions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendescription_function_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

-   A processing function performs general processing and returns a return value according to its purpose.

-   A description function determines a property of an argument and usually returns this property as a numeric value.

These include the logical functions, which either evaluate a logical expression as Boolean functions or return a truth value as a predicate function.

Built-In Functions, Obscured by Methods

Within a class, a built-in function is always hidden by [methods](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenmethod_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the class if they have the same name, regardless of the number and type of its arguments. The function is also hidden regardless of the number and type of method parameters. This also takes place in method calls for which no selector \=> or \-> is specified in front of the method name:

-   A [static method](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenstatic_method_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") hides a built-in function with the same name in all methods of the associated class.

-   An [instance method](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeninstance_method_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") hides a built-in function with the same name in the instance methods of the associated class.

The function is hidden regardless of the operand position. More specifically, any built-in functions called as arguments of other functions are also hidden.

Hint

Methods should never be given the same name as a built-in function.

Example

The following class returns a syntax error. The specification of strlen on the right side of the assignment indicates the method of the class and not the built-in function. It cannot be specified in this operand position since it is not a functional method with a return value.

Built-In Functions

ABAP provides a set of built-in functions. A built-in function returns a return value for one or more arguments. There are functions with exactly one unnamed argument and functions with one or more named arguments.

Built-in functions can be called functionally in [certain operand positions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenoperands_expressions.htm). When a built-in function is called in an [operand position](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenexpression_positions.htm), the function is executed before the operand is used and the return value of the built-in function is used as the operand, in accordance with its data type.

Built-In Functions, Syntax

-   [Functions with an Unnamed Argument](#abenbuilt-in-functions-syntax-1--------functions-with-named-arguments---@ITOC@@ABENBUILT_IN_FUNCTIONS_SYNTAX_2)

In functions with named arguments, there is usually a main argument val and with the option of further also optional arguments. The following sections show the general syntax for calling built-in functions.

Functions with an Unnamed Argument

Syntax

... func( arg ) ...

In functions with an unnamed argument, the syntax is the same as the syntax for calling functional methods with an input parameter. func is the built-in function and the argument arg is an operand whose data type matches the function. The blanks after the opening parentheses and before the closing parentheses are relevant.

Example

The built-in function [line\_exists](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenline_exists_function.htm) has an unnamed argument that expects a table expression.

DATA itab TYPE TABLE OF i WITH EMPTY KEY.
...
IF line\_exists( itab\[ 1 \] ).
¬†¬†...
ENDIF.

Functions with Named Arguments

Syntax

... func( val = arg p1 = arg1 p2 = arg2 ... ) ...

Functions with one or more named arguments, these are bound to [keyword parameters](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenkeyword_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in the same way as when functional methods are called with multiple input parameters. Operands can be specified for the arguments whose data type matches the corresponding parameter. The blanks after the opening parentheses and before the closing parentheses are relevant. If such a function has only one argument, or if only the main argument is to be supplied, the syntax can be simplified as follows:

... func( arg ) ... literal

Example

The built-in function [condense](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencondense_functions.htm) has named arguments and can, for example, be called as follows.

DATA(str1) = condense( \`...\` ).
DATA(str2) = condense( val = \`...\` ).
DATA(str3) = condense( val = \`...\`¬†¬†del = \` \` ).

Built-In Functions, Overview

The following tables summarize the built-in functions by purpose. Built-in functions are generally [processing functions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprocess_function_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or [description functions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendescription_function_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

-   A processing function performs general processing and returns a return value according to its purpose.

-   A description function determines a property of an argument and usually returns this property as a numeric value.

These include the logical functions, which either evaluate a logical expression as Boolean functions or return a truth value as a predicate function.

Built-In Functions, Obscured by Methods

Within a class, a built-in function is always hidden by [methods](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenmethod_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the class if they have the same name, regardless of the number and type of its arguments. The function is also hidden regardless of the number and type of method parameters. This also takes place in method calls for which no selector \=> or \-> is specified in front of the method name:

-   A [static method](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenstatic_method_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") hides a built-in function with the same name in all methods of the associated class.

-   An [instance method](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeninstance_method_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") hides a built-in function with the same name in the instance methods of the associated class.

The function is hidden regardless of the operand position. More specifically, any built-in functions called as arguments of other functions are also hidden.

Hint

Methods should never be given the same name as a built-in function.

Example

The following class returns a syntax error. The specification of strlen on the right side of the assignment indicates the method of the class and not the built-in function. It cannot be specified in this operand position since it is not a functional method with a return value.

Built-In Functions

ABAP provides a set of built-in functions. A built-in function returns a return value for one or more arguments. There are functions with exactly one unnamed argument and functions with one or more named arguments.

Built-in functions can be called functionally in [certain operand positions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenoperands_expressions.htm). When a built-in function is called in an [operand position](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenexpression_positions.htm), the function is executed before the operand is used and the return value of the built-in function is used as the operand, in accordance with its data type.

Built-In Functions, Syntax

-   [Functions with an Unnamed Argument](#abenbuilt-in-functions-syntax-1--------functions-with-named-arguments---@ITOC@@ABENBUILT_IN_FUNCTIONS_SYNTAX_2)

In functions with named arguments, there is usually a main argument val and with the option of further also optional arguments. The following sections show the general syntax for calling built-in functions.

Functions with an Unnamed Argument

Syntax

... func( arg ) ...

In functions with an unnamed argument, the syntax is the same as the syntax for calling functional methods with an input parameter. func is the built-in function and the argument arg is an operand whose data type matches the function. The blanks after the opening parentheses and before the closing parentheses are relevant.

Example

The built-in function [line\_exists](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenline_exists_function.htm) has an unnamed argument that expects a table expression.

DATA itab TYPE TABLE OF i WITH EMPTY KEY.
...
IF line\_exists( itab\[ 1 \] ).
¬†¬†...
ENDIF.

Functions with Named Arguments

Syntax

... func( val = arg p1 = arg1 p2 = arg2 ... ) ...

Functions with one or more named arguments, these are bound to [keyword parameters](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenkeyword_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in the same way as when functional methods are called with multiple input parameters. Operands can be specified for the arguments whose data type matches the corresponding parameter. The blanks after the opening parentheses and before the closing parentheses are relevant. If such a function has only one argument, or if only the main argument is to be supplied, the syntax can be simplified as follows:

... func( arg ) ... literal

Example

The built-in function [condense](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencondense_functions.htm) has named arguments and can, for example, be called as follows.

DATA(str1) = condense( \`...\` ).
DATA(str2) = condense( val = \`...\` ).
DATA(str3) = condense( val = \`...\`¬†¬†del = \` \` ).

Built-In Functions, Overview

The following tables summarize the built-in functions by purpose. Built-in functions are generally [processing functions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprocess_function_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or [description functions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendescription_function_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

-   A processing function performs general processing and returns a return value according to its purpose.

-   A description function determines a property of an argument and usually returns this property as a numeric value.

These include the logical functions, which either evaluate a logical expression as Boolean functions or return a truth value as a predicate function.

[ABAP - Keyword Documentation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap.htm)¬†‚Üí¬† [ABAP - Programming Language](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_reference.htm)¬†‚Üí¬† [Built-In Types, Data Objects, Functions, and Constructors](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbuilt_in.htm)¬†‚Üí¬† [Built-In Functions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbuilt_in_functions.htm)¬†‚Üí¬†

Built-In Functions, Obscured by Methods

Within a class, a built-in function is always hidden by [methods](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenmethod_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the class if they have the same name, regardless of the number and type of its arguments. The function is also hidden regardless of the number and type of method parameters. This also takes place in method calls for which no selector \=> or \-> is specified in front of the method name:

-   A [static method](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenstatic_method_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") hides a built-in function with the same name in all methods of the associated class.

-   An [instance method](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeninstance_method_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") hides a built-in function with the same name in the instance methods of the associated class.

The function is hidden regardless of the operand position. More specifically, any built-in functions called as arguments of other functions are also hidden.

Hint

Methods should never be given the same name as a built-in function.

Example

The following class returns a syntax error. The specification of strlen on the right side of the assignment indicates the method of the class and not the built-in function. It cannot be specified in this operand position since it is not a functional method with a return value.

Effect

Declaration of an internal table for HR [info types](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeninfo_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that is forbidden in classes. Without the addition NAME, an internal table pnnnn or ppnnnn is created with the structure of the info type Pnnnn and a [header](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenheader_line_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The name ppnnnn is used when the addition AS PERSON TABLE is specified, otherwise it is pnnnn.

As long as the addition MODE N is not specified, the statement INFOTYPES affects the behavior of the special [logical databases](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenlogical_data_base_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") PAP, PCH, PNP, and PNPCE of the human resources component HR by default and is the prerequisite for them to function correctly.

A four-digit numeric key of an info type of the SAP ERP component Human Resources (HR) must be specified for nnnn . Each info type is represented in the HR component by a special structure called Pnnnn in the ABAP Dictionary. Each info type contains the character-like components BEGDA and ENDDA.

Hints

-   The internal table created by the statement INFOTYPES can also be declared using the following (obsolete) statement sequence, but has no effect on the special logical databases.

[DATA BEGIN OF](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapdata_begin_of_occurs.htm) *{*pnnnn*|*ppnnnn*|*name*}* [OCCURS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapdata_begin_of_occurs.htm) *{* 10 *|* n *}*.
¬†¬†[INCLUDE TYPE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapinclude_type.htm) pnnnn.
DATA END OF *{*pnnnn*|*ppnnnn*|*name*}*
¬†¬†¬†¬† [VALID BETWEEN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapdata_begin_of_occurs.htm) *{*begda*|*intlim1*}* AND *{*endda*|*intlim2*}*.

-   No internal tables with header lines can be declared in classes. For this reason, the statement INFOTYPES is forbidden here.

-   In executable programs that are linked to the special logical databases PAP, PCH, PNP, and PNPCE of the Human Resources component, the statement INFOTYPES is still required and should only be used here.

-   PNPCE is by far the most important of the logical databases PAP, PCH, PNP, and PNPCE. The logical database PAP, on the other hand, is hardly used anymore.

-   Info types enable an HR application to effectively process employee-related data. The special statement [PROVIDE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapprovide.htm) is used for this.

-   To ensure that the statement works correctly on the logical databases, it must be executed in the [global declaration part](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenglobal_declaration_sect_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and before the first operational statements of an executable program.

-   The properties of the special logical databases determined by the statement INFOTYPES can be changed by macros defined there while the program is executed. For the logical database PNPCE, these are the macros pnp\_set\_infty\_mode\_by\_name and pnp\_set\_infty\_mode\_by\_number for changing the mode and rp\_set\_data\_interval, rp\_set\_data\_interval\_infty, and rp\_set\_data\_interval\_all for setting the validity period.
    

Addition 1

... NAME name

Effect

Using the addition NAME, a name of up to 20 characters can be specified that is then used for the internal table instead of pnnnn or ppnnnn.

Addition 2

... OCCURS n

Effect

Without the addition OCCURS, the initial memory requirements of the internal table are set to ten rows (see the addition INITIAL SIZE of the statement [TYPES - TABLE OF](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abaptypes_itab.htm)). The addition OCCURS can be used to specify a numeric literal directly or a numeric constant n, to determine a different initial memory requirement.

Addition 3

... MODE N*|*P

Addition 4

... AS PERSON TABLE

Effect

These additions affect the behavior of the special logical databases PAP, PCH, PNP, and PNPCE of the Human Resources component, whereby AS PERSON TABLE and MODE P only have an effect on the logical database PNPCE.

If the addition MODE N is not specified, the properties of the internal table are stored in an internal system table that is accessed in this logical database. If the statement INFOTYPES is listed without the addition MODE N in an [executable program](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenexecutable_program_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that is linked to one of these logical databases, the behavior is as follows:

-   The logical database PAP fills the internal table for the event [GET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapget-.htm) applicant.

-   The logical database PCH fills the internal table for the event [GET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapget-.htm) object.

-   The logical database PNP fills the internal table for the event [GET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapget-.htm) pernr.

-   The behavior of the logical database PNPCE can also be controlled using the additions AS PERSON TABLE and MODE P:

-   Without one of these additions, the internal table is filled at the event [GET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapget-.htm) pernr. Only those data records are provided that fall within the specified evaluation period on the selection screen (this is a difference to the logical database PNP, which provides all data records by default). Alternatively, the macros rp\_set\_data\_interval, rp\_set\_data\_interval\_infty, and rp\_set\_data\_interval\_all defined in the logical database can be used in the program to specify the data records that are to be provided.

-   If only the addition AS PERSON TABLE is specified, the internal table is filled with the event [GET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapget-.htm) group. The data records of all personnel numbers that are in the included structure all\_pernrs of the structure group and for which there is authorization are provided. Only those data records are provided which fall in the evaluation period specified on the selection screen. Alternatively, the macros rp\_set\_data\_interval, rp\_set\_data\_interval\_infty, and rp\_set\_data\_interval\_all defined in the logical database can be used in the program to specify the data records that are to be provided.

-   If only the addition AS PERSON TABLE is specified together with MODE P, the internal table is filled at the event [GET person](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapget-.htm). The data records of all personnel numbers that are in the included structure all\_pernrs of the structure person are provided. No authorization check is executed and all existing data records are provided regardless of how the evaluation period was set on the selection screen. The use of the macros rp\_set\_data\_interval, rp\_set\_data\_interval\_infty, and rp\_set\_data\_interval\_all has no effect on this.

If the addition MODE N is specified, the table is not linked to the logical databases and is not filled during the GET events.

Hint

For more information, see the documentation about the logical databases and particularly about the PNPCE documentation.

Addition 5

... VALID FROM intlim1 TO intlim2

Effect

Without the addition VALID FROM, the components BEGDA and ENDDA of the info type Pnnnn are defined implicitly as the interval limits for the [obsolete form](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapprovide_obsolete.htm) of the statement [PROVIDE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapprovide.htm). With the addition VALID FROM, other [flat](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenflat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") character-like components intlim1 and intlim2 of the info type can be defined as implicit interval limits.

Effect

Declaration of an internal table for HR [info types](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeninfo_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that is forbidden in classes. Without the addition NAME, an internal table pnnnn or ppnnnn is created with the structure of the info type Pnnnn and a [header](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenheader_line_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The name ppnnnn is used when the addition AS PERSON TABLE is specified, otherwise it is pnnnn.

As long as the addition MODE N is not specified, the statement INFOTYPES affects the behavior of the special [logical databases](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenlogical_data_base_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") PAP, PCH, PNP, and PNPCE of the human resources component HR by default and is the prerequisite for them to function correctly.

A four-digit numeric key of an info type of the SAP ERP component Human Resources (HR) must be specified for nnnn . Each info type is represented in the HR component by a special structure called Pnnnn in the ABAP Dictionary. Each info type contains the character-like components BEGDA and ENDDA.

Hints

-   The internal table created by the statement INFOTYPES can also be declared using the following (obsolete) statement sequence, but has no effect on the special logical databases.

[DATA BEGIN OF](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapdata_begin_of_occurs.htm) *{*pnnnn*|*ppnnnn*|*name*}* [OCCURS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapdata_begin_of_occurs.htm) *{* 10 *|* n *}*.
¬†¬†[INCLUDE TYPE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapinclude_type.htm) pnnnn.

¬†¬†¬†¬† [VALID BETWEEN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapdata_begin_of_occurs.htm) *{*begda*|*intlim1*}* AND *{*endda*|*intlim2*}*.

-   No internal tables with header lines can be declared in classes. For this reason, the statement INFOTYPES is forbidden here.

-   In executable programs that are linked to the special logical databases PAP, PCH, PNP, and PNPCE of the Human Resources component, the statement INFOTYPES is still required and should only be used here.

-   PNPCE is by far the most important of the logical databases PAP, PCH, PNP, and PNPCE. The logical database PAP, on the other hand, is hardly used anymore.

-   Info types enable an HR application to effectively process employee-related data. The special statement [PROVIDE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapprovide.htm) is used for this.

-   To ensure that the statement works correctly on the logical databases, it must be executed in the [global declaration part](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenglobal_declaration_sect_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and before the first operational statements of an executable program.

-   The properties of the special logical databases determined by the statement INFOTYPES can be changed by macros defined there while the program is executed. For the logical database PNPCE, these are the macros pnp\_set\_infty\_mode\_by\_name and pnp\_set\_infty\_mode\_by\_number for changing the mode and rp\_set\_data\_interval, rp\_set\_data\_interval\_infty, and rp\_set\_data\_interval\_all for setting the validity period.
    

Addition 1

... NAME name

Effect

Using the addition NAME, a name of up to 20 characters can be specified that is then used for the internal table instead of pnnnn or ppnnnn.

Addition 2

... OCCURS n

Effect

Without the addition OCCURS, the initial memory requirements of the internal table are set to ten rows (see the addition INITIAL SIZE of the statement [TYPES - TABLE OF](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abaptypes_itab.htm)). The addition OCCURS can be used to specify a numeric literal directly or a numeric constant n, to determine a different initial memory requirement.

Addition 3

... MODE N*|*P

Addition 4

... AS PERSON TABLE

Effect

These additions affect the behavior of the special logical databases PAP, PCH, PNP, and PNPCE of the Human Resources component, whereby AS PERSON TABLE and MODE P only have an effect on the logical database PNPCE.

If the addition MODE N is not specified, the properties of the internal table are stored in an internal system table that is accessed in this logical database. If the statement INFOTYPES is listed without the addition MODE N in an [executable program](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenexecutable_program_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that is linked to one of these logical databases, the behavior is as follows:

-   The logical database PAP fills the internal table for the event [GET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapget-.htm) applicant.

-   The logical database PCH fills the internal table for the event [GET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapget-.htm) object.

-   The logical database PNP fills the internal table for the event [GET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapget-.htm) pernr.

-   The behavior of the logical database PNPCE can also be controlled using the additions AS PERSON TABLE and MODE P:

-   Without one of these additions, the internal table is filled at the event [GET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapget-.htm) pernr. Only those data records are provided that fall within the specified evaluation period on the selection screen (this is a difference to the logical database PNP, which provides all data records by default). Alternatively, the macros rp\_set\_data\_interval, rp\_set\_data\_interval\_infty, and rp\_set\_data\_interval\_all defined in the logical database can be used in the program to specify the data records that are to be provided.

-   If only the addition AS PERSON TABLE is specified, the internal table is filled with the event [GET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapget-.htm) group. The data records of all personnel numbers that are in the included structure all\_pernrs of the structure group and for which there is authorization are provided. Only those data records are provided which fall in the evaluation period specified on the selection screen. Alternatively, the macros rp\_set\_data\_interval, rp\_set\_data\_interval\_infty, and rp\_set\_data\_interval\_all defined in the logical database can be used in the program to specify the data records that are to be provided.

-   If only the addition AS PERSON TABLE is specified together with MODE P, the internal table is filled at the event [GET person](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapget-.htm). The data records of all personnel numbers that are in the included structure all\_pernrs of the structure person are provided. No authorization check is executed and all existing data records are provided regardless of how the evaluation period was set on the selection screen. The use of the macros rp\_set\_data\_interval, rp\_set\_data\_interval\_infty, and rp\_set\_data\_interval\_all has no effect on this.

If the addition MODE N is specified, the table is not linked to the logical databases and is not filled during the GET events.

Hint

For more information, see the documentation about the logical databases and particularly about the PNPCE documentation.

Addition 5

... VALID FROM intlim1 TO intlim2

Effect

Without the addition VALID FROM, the components BEGDA and ENDDA of the info type Pnnnn are defined implicitly as the interval limits for the [obsolete form](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapprovide_obsolete.htm) of the statement [PROVIDE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapprovide.htm). With the addition VALID FROM, other [flat](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenflat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") character-like components intlim1 and intlim2 of the info type can be defined as implicit interval limits.

Effect

Declaration of an internal table for HR [info types](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeninfo_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that is forbidden in classes. Without the addition NAME, an internal table pnnnn or ppnnnn is created with the structure of the info type Pnnnn and a [header](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenheader_line_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The name ppnnnn is used when the addition AS PERSON TABLE is specified, otherwise it is pnnnn.

As long as the addition MODE N is not specified, the statement INFOTYPES affects the behavior of the special [logical databases](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenlogical_data_base_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") PAP, PCH, PNP, and PNPCE of the human resources component HR by default and is the prerequisite for them to function correctly.

A four-digit numeric key of an info type of the SAP ERP component Human Resources (HR) must be specified for nnnn . Each info type is represented in the HR component by a special structure called Pnnnn in the ABAP Dictionary. Each info type contains the character-like components BEGDA and ENDDA.

Hints

-   The internal table created by the statement INFOTYPES can also be declared using the following (obsolete) statement sequence, but has no effect on the special logical databases.

[DATA BEGIN OF](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapdata_begin_of_occurs.htm) *{*pnnnn*|*ppnnnn*|*name*}* [OCCURS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapdata_begin_of_occurs.htm) *{* 10 *|* n *}*.

¬†¬†¬†¬† [VALID BETWEEN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapdata_begin_of_occurs.htm) *{*begda*|*intlim1*}* AND *{*endda*|*intlim2*}*.

-   No internal tables with header lines can be declared in classes. For this reason, the statement INFOTYPES is forbidden here.

-   In executable programs that are linked to the special logical databases PAP, PCH, PNP, and PNPCE of the Human Resources component, the statement INFOTYPES is still required and should only be used here.

-   PNPCE is by far the most important of the logical databases PAP, PCH, PNP, and PNPCE. The logical database PAP, on the other hand, is hardly used anymore.

-   Info types enable an HR application to effectively process employee-related data. The special statement [PROVIDE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapprovide.htm) is used for this.

-   To ensure that the statement works correctly on the logical databases, it must be executed in the [global declaration part](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenglobal_declaration_sect_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and before the first operational statements of an executable program.

-   The properties of the special logical databases determined by the statement INFOTYPES can be changed by macros defined there while the program is executed. For the logical database PNPCE, these are the macros pnp\_set\_infty\_mode\_by\_name and pnp\_set\_infty\_mode\_by\_number for changing the mode and rp\_set\_data\_interval, rp\_set\_data\_interval\_infty, and rp\_set\_data\_interval\_all for setting the validity period.
    

Addition 1

... NAME name

Effect

Using the addition NAME, a name of up to 20 characters can be specified that is then used for the internal table instead of pnnnn or ppnnnn.

Addition 2

... OCCURS n

Effect

Without the addition OCCURS, the initial memory requirements of the internal table are set to ten rows (see the addition INITIAL SIZE of the statement [TYPES - TABLE OF](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abaptypes_itab.htm)). The addition OCCURS can be used to specify a numeric literal directly or a numeric constant n, to determine a different initial memory requirement.

Addition 3

... MODE N*|*P

Addition 4

... AS PERSON TABLE

Effect

These additions affect the behavior of the special logical databases PAP, PCH, PNP, and PNPCE of the Human Resources component, whereby AS PERSON TABLE and MODE P only have an effect on the logical database PNPCE.

If the addition MODE N is not specified, the properties of the internal table are stored in an internal system table that is accessed in this logical database. If the statement INFOTYPES is listed without the addition MODE N in an [executable program](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenexecutable_program_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that is linked to one of these logical databases, the behavior is as follows:

-   The logical database PAP fills the internal table for the event [GET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapget-.htm) applicant.

-   The logical database PCH fills the internal table for the event [GET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapget-.htm) object.

-   The logical database PNP fills the internal table for the event [GET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapget-.htm) pernr.

-   The behavior of the logical database PNPCE can also be controlled using the additions AS PERSON TABLE and MODE P:

-   Without one of these additions, the internal table is filled at the event [GET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapget-.htm) pernr. Only those data records are provided that fall within the specified evaluation period on the selection screen (this is a difference to the logical database PNP, which provides all data records by default). Alternatively, the macros rp\_set\_data\_interval, rp\_set\_data\_interval\_infty, and rp\_set\_data\_interval\_all defined in the logical database can be used in the program to specify the data records that are to be provided.

-   If only the addition AS PERSON TABLE is specified, the internal table is filled with the event [GET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapget-.htm) group. The data records of all personnel numbers that are in the included structure all\_pernrs of the structure group and for which there is authorization are provided. Only those data records are provided which fall in the evaluation period specified on the selection screen. Alternatively, the macros rp\_set\_data\_interval, rp\_set\_data\_interval\_infty, and rp\_set\_data\_interval\_all defined in the logical database can be used in the program to specify the data records that are to be provided.

-   If only the addition AS PERSON TABLE is specified together with MODE P, the internal table is filled at the event [GET person](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapget-.htm). The data records of all personnel numbers that are in the included structure all\_pernrs of the structure person are provided. No authorization check is executed and all existing data records are provided regardless of how the evaluation period was set on the selection screen. The use of the macros rp\_set\_data\_interval, rp\_set\_data\_interval\_infty, and rp\_set\_data\_interval\_all has no effect on this.

If the addition MODE N is specified, the table is not linked to the logical databases and is not filled during the GET events.

Hint

For more information, see the documentation about the logical databases and particularly about the PNPCE documentation.

Addition 5

... VALID FROM intlim1 TO intlim2

Effect

Without the addition VALID FROM, the components BEGDA and ENDDA of the info type Pnnnn are defined implicitly as the interval limits for the [obsolete form](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapprovide_obsolete.htm) of the statement [PROVIDE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapprovide.htm). With the addition VALID FROM, other [flat](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenflat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") character-like components intlim1 and intlim2 of the info type can be defined as implicit interval limits.

Effect

Declaration of an internal table for HR [info types](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeninfo_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that is forbidden in classes. Without the addition NAME, an internal table pnnnn or ppnnnn is created with the structure of the info type Pnnnn and a [header](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenheader_line_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The name ppnnnn is used when the addition AS PERSON TABLE is specified, otherwise it is pnnnn.

As long as the addition MODE N is not specified, the statement INFOTYPES affects the behavior of the special [logical databases](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenlogical_data_base_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") PAP, PCH, PNP, and PNPCE of the human resources component HR by default and is the prerequisite for them to function correctly.

A four-digit numeric key of an info type of the SAP ERP component Human Resources (HR) must be specified for nnnn . Each info type is represented in the HR component by a special structure called Pnnnn in the ABAP Dictionary. Each info type contains the character-like components BEGDA and ENDDA.

Hints

-   The internal table created by the statement INFOTYPES can also be declared using the following (obsolete) statement sequence, but has no effect on the special logical databases.

[DATA BEGIN OF](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapdata_begin_of_occurs.htm) *{*pnnnn*|*ppnnnn*|*name*}* [OCCURS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapdata_begin_of_occurs.htm) *{* 10 *|* n *}*.

¬†¬†¬†¬† [VALID BETWEEN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapdata_begin_of_occurs.htm) *{*begda*|*intlim1*}* AND *{*endda*|*intlim2*}*.

-   No internal tables with header lines can be declared in classes. For this reason, the statement INFOTYPES is forbidden here.

-   In executable programs that are linked to the special logical databases PAP, PCH, PNP, and PNPCE of the Human Resources component, the statement INFOTYPES is still required and should only be used here.

-   PNPCE is by far the most important of the logical databases PAP, PCH, PNP, and PNPCE. The logical database PAP, on the other hand, is hardly used anymore.

-   Info types enable an HR application to effectively process employee-related data. The special statement [PROVIDE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapprovide.htm) is used for this.

-   To ensure that the statement works correctly on the logical databases, it must be executed in the [global declaration part](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenglobal_declaration_sect_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and before the first operational statements of an executable program.

-   The properties of the special logical databases determined by the statement INFOTYPES can be changed by macros defined there while the program is executed. For the logical database PNPCE, these are the macros pnp\_set\_infty\_mode\_by\_name and pnp\_set\_infty\_mode\_by\_number for changing the mode and rp\_set\_data\_interval, rp\_set\_data\_interval\_infty, and rp\_set\_data\_interval\_all for setting the validity period.
    

Addition 1

... NAME name

Effect

Using the addition NAME, a name of up to 20 characters can be specified that is then used for the internal table instead of pnnnn or ppnnnn.

Addition 2

... OCCURS n

Effect

Without the addition OCCURS, the initial memory requirements of the internal table are set to ten rows (see the addition INITIAL SIZE of the statement [TYPES - TABLE OF](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abaptypes_itab.htm)). The addition OCCURS can be used to specify a numeric literal directly or a numeric constant n, to determine a different initial memory requirement.

Addition 3

... MODE N*|*P

Addition 4

... AS PERSON TABLE

Effect

These additions affect the behavior of the special logical databases PAP, PCH, PNP, and PNPCE of the Human Resources component, whereby AS PERSON TABLE and MODE P only have an effect on the logical database PNPCE.

If the addition MODE N is not specified, the properties of the internal table are stored in an internal system table that is accessed in this logical database. If the statement INFOTYPES is listed without the addition MODE N in an [executable program](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenexecutable_program_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that is linked to one of these logical databases, the behavior is as follows:

-   The logical database PAP fills the internal table for the event [GET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapget-.htm) applicant.

-   The logical database PCH fills the internal table for the event [GET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapget-.htm) object.

-   The logical database PNP fills the internal table for the event [GET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapget-.htm) pernr.

-   The behavior of the logical database PNPCE can also be controlled using the additions AS PERSON TABLE and MODE P:

-   Without one of these additions, the internal table is filled at the event [GET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapget-.htm) pernr. Only those data records are provided that fall within the specified evaluation period on the selection screen (this is a difference to the logical database PNP, which provides all data records by default). Alternatively, the macros rp\_set\_data\_interval, rp\_set\_data\_interval\_infty, and rp\_set\_data\_interval\_all defined in the logical database can be used in the program to specify the data records that are to be provided.

-   If only the addition AS PERSON TABLE is specified, the internal table is filled with the event [GET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapget-.htm) group. The data records of all personnel numbers that are in the included structure all\_pernrs of the structure group and for which there is authorization are provided. Only those data records are provided which fall in the evaluation period specified on the selection screen. Alternatively, the macros rp\_set\_data\_interval, rp\_set\_data\_interval\_infty, and rp\_set\_data\_interval\_all defined in the logical database can be used in the program to specify the data records that are to be provided.

-   If only the addition AS PERSON TABLE is specified together with MODE P, the internal table is filled at the event [GET person](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapget-.htm). The data records of all personnel numbers that are in the included structure all\_pernrs of the structure person are provided. No authorization check is executed and all existing data records are provided regardless of how the evaluation period was set on the selection screen. The use of the macros rp\_set\_data\_interval, rp\_set\_data\_interval\_infty, and rp\_set\_data\_interval\_all has no effect on this.

If the addition MODE N is specified, the table is not linked to the logical databases and is not filled during the GET events.

Hint

For more information, see the documentation about the logical databases and particularly about the PNPCE documentation.

Addition 5

... VALID FROM intlim1 TO intlim2

Effect

Without the addition VALID FROM, the components BEGDA and ENDDA of the info type Pnnnn are defined implicitly as the interval limits for the [obsolete form](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapprovide_obsolete.htm) of the statement [PROVIDE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapprovide.htm). With the addition VALID FROM, other [flat](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenflat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") character-like components intlim1 and intlim2 of the info type can be defined as implicit interval limits.

Effect

Declaration of an internal table for HR [info types](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeninfo_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that is forbidden in classes. Without the addition NAME, an internal table pnnnn or ppnnnn is created with the structure of the info type Pnnnn and a [header](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenheader_line_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The name ppnnnn is used when the addition AS PERSON TABLE is specified, otherwise it is pnnnn.

As long as the addition MODE N is not specified, the statement INFOTYPES affects the behavior of the special [logical databases](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenlogical_data_base_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") PAP, PCH, PNP, and PNPCE of the human resources component HR by default and is the prerequisite for them to function correctly.

A four-digit numeric key of an info type of the SAP ERP component Human Resources (HR) must be specified for nnnn . Each info type is represented in the HR component by a special structure called Pnnnn in the ABAP Dictionary. Each info type contains the character-like components BEGDA and ENDDA.

Hints

-   The internal table created by the statement INFOTYPES can also be declared using the following (obsolete) statement sequence, but has no effect on the special logical databases.

[DATA BEGIN OF](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapdata_begin_of_occurs.htm) *{*pnnnn*|*ppnnnn*|*name*}* [OCCURS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapdata_begin_of_occurs.htm) *{* 10 *|* n *}*.

¬†¬†¬†¬† [VALID BETWEEN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapdata_begin_of_occurs.htm) *{*begda*|*intlim1*}* AND *{*endda*|*intlim2*}*.

-   No internal tables with header lines can be declared in classes. For this reason, the statement INFOTYPES is forbidden here.

-   In executable programs that are linked to the special logical databases PAP, PCH, PNP, and PNPCE of the Human Resources component, the statement INFOTYPES is still required and should only be used here.

-   PNPCE is by far the most important of the logical databases PAP, PCH, PNP, and PNPCE. The logical database PAP, on the other hand, is hardly used anymore.

-   Info types enable an HR application to effectively process employee-related data. The special statement [PROVIDE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapprovide.htm) is used for this.

-   To ensure that the statement works correctly on the logical databases, it must be executed in the [global declaration part](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenglobal_declaration_sect_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and before the first operational statements of an executable program.

-   The properties of the special logical databases determined by the statement INFOTYPES can be changed by macros defined there while the program is executed. For the logical database PNPCE, these are the macros pnp\_set\_infty\_mode\_by\_name and pnp\_set\_infty\_mode\_by\_number for changing the mode and rp\_set\_data\_interval, rp\_set\_data\_interval\_infty, and rp\_set\_data\_interval\_all for setting the validity period.
    

Addition 1

... NAME name

Effect

Using the addition NAME, a name of up to 20 characters can be specified that is then used for the internal table instead of pnnnn or ppnnnn.

Addition 2

... OCCURS n

Effect

Without the addition OCCURS, the initial memory requirements of the internal table are set to ten rows (see the addition INITIAL SIZE of the statement [TYPES - TABLE OF](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abaptypes_itab.htm)). The addition OCCURS can be used to specify a numeric literal directly or a numeric constant n, to determine a different initial memory requirement.

Addition 3

... MODE N*|*P

Addition 4

... AS PERSON TABLE

Effect

These additions affect the behavior of the special logical databases PAP, PCH, PNP, and PNPCE of the Human Resources component, whereby AS PERSON TABLE and MODE P only have an effect on the logical database PNPCE.

If the addition MODE N is not specified, the properties of the internal table are stored in an internal system table that is accessed in this logical database. If the statement INFOTYPES is listed without the addition MODE N in an [executable program](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenexecutable_program_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that is linked to one of these logical databases, the behavior is as follows:

-   The logical database PAP fills the internal table for the event [GET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapget-.htm) applicant.

-   The logical database PCH fills the internal table for the event [GET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapget-.htm) object.

-   The logical database PNP fills the internal table for the event [GET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapget-.htm) pernr.

-   The behavior of the logical database PNPCE can also be controlled using the additions AS PERSON TABLE and MODE P:

-   Without one of these additions, the internal table is filled at the event [GET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapget-.htm) pernr. Only those data records are provided that fall within the specified evaluation period on the selection screen (this is a difference to the logical database PNP, which provides all data records by default). Alternatively, the macros rp\_set\_data\_interval, rp\_set\_data\_interval\_infty, and rp\_set\_data\_interval\_all defined in the logical database can be used in the program to specify the data records that are to be provided.

-   If only the addition AS PERSON TABLE is specified, the internal table is filled with the event [GET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapget-.htm) group. The data records of all personnel numbers that are in the included structure all\_pernrs of the structure group and for which there is authorization are provided. Only those data records are provided which fall in the evaluation period specified on the selection screen. Alternatively, the macros rp\_set\_data\_interval, rp\_set\_data\_interval\_infty, and rp\_set\_data\_interval\_all defined in the logical database can be used in the program to specify the data records that are to be provided.

-   If only the addition AS PERSON TABLE is specified together with MODE P, the internal table is filled at the event [GET person](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapget-.htm). The data records of all personnel numbers that are in the included structure all\_pernrs of the structure person are provided. No authorization check is executed and all existing data records are provided regardless of how the evaluation period was set on the selection screen. The use of the macros rp\_set\_data\_interval, rp\_set\_data\_interval\_infty, and rp\_set\_data\_interval\_all has no effect on this.

If the addition MODE N is specified, the table is not linked to the logical databases and is not filled during the GET events.

Hint

For more information, see the documentation about the logical databases and particularly about the PNPCE documentation.

Addition 5

... VALID FROM intlim1 TO intlim2

Effect

Without the addition VALID FROM, the components BEGDA and ENDDA of the info type Pnnnn are defined implicitly as the interval limits for the [obsolete form](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapprovide_obsolete.htm) of the statement [PROVIDE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapprovide.htm). With the addition VALID FROM, other [flat](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenflat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") character-like components intlim1 and intlim2 of the info type can be defined as implicit interval limits.

Effect

Declaration of an internal table for HR [info types](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeninfo_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that is forbidden in classes. Without the addition NAME, an internal table pnnnn or ppnnnn is created with the structure of the info type Pnnnn and a [header](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenheader_line_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The name ppnnnn is used when the addition AS PERSON TABLE is specified, otherwise it is pnnnn.

As long as the addition MODE N is not specified, the statement INFOTYPES affects the behavior of the special [logical databases](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenlogical_data_base_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") PAP, PCH, PNP, and PNPCE of the human resources component HR by default and is the prerequisite for them to function correctly.

A four-digit numeric key of an info type of the SAP ERP component Human Resources (HR) must be specified for nnnn . Each info type is represented in the HR component by a special structure called Pnnnn in the ABAP Dictionary. Each info type contains the character-like components BEGDA and ENDDA.

Hints

-   The internal table created by the statement INFOTYPES can also be declared using the following (obsolete) statement sequence, but has no effect on the special logical databases.

[DATA BEGIN OF](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapdata_begin_of_occurs.htm) *{*pnnnn*|*ppnnnn*|*name*}* [OCCURS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapdata_begin_of_occurs.htm) *{* 10 *|* n *}*.
¬†¬†[INCLUDE TYPE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapinclude_type.htm) pnnnn.
DATA END OF *{*pnnnn*|*ppnnnn*|*name*}*
¬†¬†¬†¬† [VALID BETWEEN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapdata_begin_of_occurs.htm) *{*begda*|*intlim1*}* AND *{*endda*|*intlim2*}*.

-   No internal tables with header lines can be declared in classes. For this reason, the statement INFOTYPES is forbidden here.

-   In executable programs that are linked to the special logical databases PAP, PCH, PNP, and PNPCE of the Human Resources component, the statement INFOTYPES is still required and should only be used here.

-   PNPCE is by far the most important of the logical databases PAP, PCH, PNP, and PNPCE. The logical database PAP, on the other hand, is hardly used anymore.

-   Info types enable an HR application to effectively process employee-related data. The special statement [PROVIDE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapprovide.htm) is used for this.

-   To ensure that the statement works correctly on the logical databases, it must be executed in the [global declaration part](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenglobal_declaration_sect_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and before the first operational statements of an executable program.

-   The properties of the special logical databases determined by the statement INFOTYPES can be changed by macros defined there while the program is executed. For the logical database PNPCE, these are the macros pnp\_set\_infty\_mode\_by\_name and pnp\_set\_infty\_mode\_by\_number for changing the mode and rp\_set\_data\_interval, rp\_set\_data\_interval\_infty, and rp\_set\_data\_interval\_all for setting the validity period.
    

Addition 1

... NAME name

Effect

Using the addition NAME, a name of up to 20 characters can be specified that is then used for the internal table instead of pnnnn or ppnnnn.

Addition 2

... OCCURS n

Effect

Without the addition OCCURS, the initial memory requirements of the internal table are set to ten rows (see the addition INITIAL SIZE of the statement [TYPES - TABLE OF](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abaptypes_itab.htm)). The addition OCCURS can be used to specify a numeric literal directly or a numeric constant n, to determine a different initial memory requirement.

Addition 3

... MODE N*|*P

Addition 4

... AS PERSON TABLE

Effect

These additions affect the behavior of the special logical databases PAP, PCH, PNP, and PNPCE of the Human Resources component, whereby AS PERSON TABLE and MODE P only have an effect on the logical database PNPCE.

If the addition MODE N is not specified, the properties of the internal table are stored in an internal system table that is accessed in this logical database. If the statement INFOTYPES is listed without the addition MODE N in an [executable program](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenexecutable_program_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that is linked to one of these logical databases, the behavior is as follows:

-   The logical database PAP fills the internal table for the event [GET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapget-.htm) applicant.

-   The logical database PCH fills the internal table for the event [GET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapget-.htm) object.

-   The logical database PNP fills the internal table for the event [GET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapget-.htm) pernr.

-   The behavior of the logical database PNPCE can also be controlled using the additions AS PERSON TABLE and MODE P:

-   Without one of these additions, the internal table is filled at the event [GET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapget-.htm) pernr. Only those data records are provided that fall within the specified evaluation period on the selection screen (this is a difference to the logical database PNP, which provides all data records by default). Alternatively, the macros rp\_set\_data\_interval, rp\_set\_data\_interval\_infty, and rp\_set\_data\_interval\_all defined in the logical database can be used in the program to specify the data records that are to be provided.

-   If only the addition AS PERSON TABLE is specified, the internal table is filled with the event [GET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapget-.htm) group. The data records of all personnel numbers that are in the included structure all\_pernrs of the structure group and for which there is authorization are provided. Only those data records are provided which fall in the evaluation period specified on the selection screen. Alternatively, the macros rp\_set\_data\_interval, rp\_set\_data\_interval\_infty, and rp\_set\_data\_interval\_all defined in the logical database can be used in the program to specify the data records that are to be provided.

-   If only the addition AS PERSON TABLE is specified together with MODE P, the internal table is filled at the event [GET person](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapget-.htm). The data records of all personnel numbers that are in the included structure all\_pernrs of the structure person are provided. No authorization check is executed and all existing data records are provided regardless of how the evaluation period was set on the selection screen. The use of the macros rp\_set\_data\_interval, rp\_set\_data\_interval\_infty, and rp\_set\_data\_interval\_all has no effect on this.

If the addition MODE N is specified, the table is not linked to the logical databases and is not filled during the GET events.

Hint

For more information, see the documentation about the logical databases and particularly about the PNPCE documentation.

Addition 5

... VALID FROM intlim1 TO intlim2

Effect

Without the addition VALID FROM, the components BEGDA and ENDDA of the info type Pnnnn are defined implicitly as the interval limits for the [obsolete form](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapprovide_obsolete.htm) of the statement [PROVIDE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapprovide.htm). With the addition VALID FROM, other [flat](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenflat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") character-like components intlim1 and intlim2 of the info type can be defined as implicit interval limits.

Effect

In the [public](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenpublic_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [visibility section](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenvisibility_section_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of a class, the statement INTERFACES implements the interface intf in the class. Additions can also be specified to determine the properties of interface components in the class.

All local or global interfaces that are visible here can be specified for intf that are not already included in a superclass of the current class. The components of the interfaces become public components of the class after the implementation. An interface component called comp has the name intf~comp in the class, where intf is the name of the interface and the character ~ is the interface component selector. A class must implement all methods of the interface in its implementation part, with the following exceptions:

-   Interface methods declared as optional using the addition [DEFAULT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods_default.htm).

-   Interface methods that are specified in the class after the addition ABSTRACT METHODS and are therefore declared as abstract.

-   Partial implementations are allowed in test classes using the addition [PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapinterfaces_partially.htm).

Hints

-   A class can implement any number of different interfaces. All of the interfaces implemented by a class are equal and on the same level. If an interface intf implemented in a class is a composite, that is, it contains component interfaces, these are implemented in the class like individual interfaces, regardless of their nesting hierarchy, and their components are addressed using the name of their component interface instead of using the name intf. It is generally not possible to use the interface component selector multiple times in a name (intf1~intf2~comp).
    

-   Each interface appears only once in a class and every interface component comp is always clearly accessible using the intf~comp. Even the components of an interface, which is the interface component of one or more other interface, and appears to be implemented multiple times in a class, only exist once.
    

-   If the implementation of a non-optional method of a global interface implemented using INTERFACES is missing in a class, a syntax warning occurs instead of a syntax error. This prevents classes from becoming unusable due to subsequent enhancements of global interfaces. Calling a missing implementation, however, always raises an exception of the class CX\_SY\_DYN\_CALL\_ILLEGAL\_METHOD and, if not handled, produces the runtime error CALL\_METHOD\_NOT\_IMPLEMENTED. A real syntax error is produced when local interfaces are used, and the implementation is missing.
    

-   If a class implements a method intf~... of a global interface intf implemented using INTERFACES in its implementation part and the method is not declared in the interface, a warning is raised by the syntax check. This type of method implementation is dead code that cannot be executed and should removed. Classes become unusable in the case of a syntax error if methods were later deleted from an implemented global interface, and which were implemented without a role in a class and had no values. An actual syntax error occurs when local interfaces are used.

Addition 1

... ABSTRACT METHODS meth1 meth2 ...

Addition 2

... FINAL METHODS meth1 meth2 ...

Effect

Using the additions ABSTRACT METHODS and FINAL METHODS, the individual instance methods meth of the interface can be made either abstract or final in the class to be implemented. The same rules apply as to the additions [ABSTRACT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods_abstract_final.htm) and [FINAL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods_abstract_final.htm) of the statement [METHODS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods.htm). In particular, the whole class must be abstract if an interface method is made abstract and at the same time no interface method can be listed after ABSTRACT METHODS and FINAL METHODS.

The following can be specified as methods meth1, meth2, ...

-   Instance methods that are declared in the interface intf itself.

-   Alias names declared in the interface intf for instance methods declared in interfaces that are included in intf.

-   Instance methods that are declared in interfaces bound in intf using the name of its own interface and the interface component selector (~). In this case the component interface cannot itself be included with the statement INTERFACES.

If an interface is included using multiple INTERFACES statements, the specifications in the additions FINAL and ABSTRACT must not produce contradictory definitions for a method.

Example

Definition of abstract methods when including two interfaces intf1 and intf2 in an abstract class cls.

INTERFACE intf1.
¬†¬†METHODS meth1.
ENDINTERFACE.
INTERFACE intf2.
¬†¬†INTERFACES intf1.
¬†¬†METHODS meth2.
ENDINTERFACE.
CLASS cls DEFINITION ABSTRACT.
¬†¬†PUBLIC SECTION.
¬†¬†¬†¬†INTERFACES intf1 ABSTRACT METHODS meth1.
¬†¬†¬†¬†INTERFACES intf2 ABSTRACT METHODS meth2.
ENDCLASS.

Example

Short form of the preceding example. Since intf2 includes the interface intf1, its methods can be specified as intf1~meth1. This means that a separate statement INTERFACES intf1 is no longer possible in this class.

INTERFACE intf1.
¬†¬†METHODS meth1.
ENDINTERFACE.
INTERFACE intf2.
¬†¬†INTERFACES intf1.
¬†¬†METHODS meth2.
ENDINTERFACE.
CLASS cls DEFINITION ABSTRACT.
¬†¬†PUBLIC SECTION.
¬†¬†¬†¬†INTERFACES intf2 ABSTRACT METHODS intf1~meth1 meth2.
ENDCLASS.

Addition 3

... ALL METHODS *{*ABSTRACT*|*FINAL*}*

Effect

Instead of making individual interface methods in the class abstract or final it is possible, using the addition ALL METHODS *{*ABSTRACT*|*FINAL*}*, to make all interface methods either [abstract](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods_abstract_final.htm) or [final](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods_abstract_final.htm).

Example

Implementation of an interface intf in an abstract class cls1, in which all methods are made abstract and must be implemented in a subclass cls2.

INTERFACE intf.
¬†¬†METHODS:
¬†¬†¬†¬†meth1,
¬†¬†¬†¬†meth2.
¬†¬†...
ENDINTERFACE.
CLASS cls1 DEFINITION ABSTRACT.
¬†¬†PUBLIC SECTION.
¬†¬†¬†¬†INTERFACES intf ALL METHODS ABSTRACT.
¬†¬†¬†¬†ALIASES:
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†meth1 FOR intf~meth1,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†meth2 FOR intf~meth2.
ENDCLASS.
CLASS cls2 DEFINITION INHERITING FROM cls1.
¬†¬†PUBLIC SECTION.
¬†¬†¬†¬†METHODS:
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†meth1 REDEFINITION,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†meth2 REDEFINITION.
ENDCLASS.
CLASS cls2 IMPLEMENTATION.
¬†¬†METHOD meth1.
¬†¬†¬†¬†...
¬†¬†ENDMETHOD.
¬†¬†METHOD meth2.
¬†¬†¬†¬†...
¬†¬†ENDMETHOD.
ENDCLASS.

Addition 4

... DATA VALUES attr1 = val1 attr2 = val2 ...

Effect

Using the addition DATA VALUES, initial values can be assigned to individual attributes attr. For attributes, this addition fulfills the same functions as the addition VALUE of the statement [DATA](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapdata.htm) for attributes in its own class.

The following can be specified as attributes attr1, attr2, ...

-   Attributes that are declared in the interface intf itself.

-   Alias names declared in the interface intf for attributes declared in interfaces that are included in intf.

-   Attributes that are declared in interfaces included in intf using the name of its own interface and the interface component selector (~). In this case the component interface cannot itself be included with the statement INTERFACES.

Constants declared in the interface or in a component interface with the statement [CONSTANTS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapconstants.htm) cannot be specified after the addition DATA VALUES.

Example

Implementation of an interface intf in a class cls, where the interface attributes are assigned start values.

INTERFACE intf.
¬†¬†CLASS-DATA:
¬†¬†¬†¬†attr1 TYPE string,
¬†¬†¬†¬†attr2 TYPE string.
¬†¬†...
ENDINTERFACE.
CLASS cls DEFINITION ABSTRACT.
¬†¬†PUBLIC SECTION.
¬†¬†¬†¬†INTERFACES intf
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†DATA VALUES attr1 = 'Hello'
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†attr2 = 'World'.
¬†¬†¬†¬†ALIASES:
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†attr1 FOR intf~attr1,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†attr2 FOR intf~attr2.
ENDCLASS.
START-OF-SELECTION.
¬†¬†cl\_demo\_output=>display( |{ cls=>attr1 } { cls=>attr2 }| ).

INTERFACES, composition

[Short Reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapinterfaces_shortref.htm)

Syntax

INTERFACES intf.

Effect

In the declaration of an interface, the statement INTERFACES includes the interface intf in the declared interface. Additions cannot be specified. As a result, the interface intf becomes a component interface of a composite interface.

An interface can be composed of any number of different component interfaces. All component interfaces are equal and on one level. If a component interface itself is a composite, that is, it contains its own component interfaces, the nesting hierarchy is irrelevant for the composition of the interface. It is relevant, however, for accessing the interface components.

To access the component comp of a component interface intf within a composite interface, the expression intf~comp can be used with the interface component selector (~). It is not possible to use the interface component selector multiple times in a name (intf1~intf2~comp). In a composite interface, it is possible to use the interface component selector to access only those interface components of the component interface that are included in this interface using the statement INTERFACES. Since all nested interfaces are at the same level, however, this is sufficient to access the interface components of all component interfaces using the name of their interface.

Hints

-   Each interface and its components appear only once in a composite interface. Even an interface that is seemingly implemented more than once in an interface, because it is an interface component of one or more other interfaces, really exists only once.

-   Since there are no separate namespaces for global and local interfaces, it must be ensured that combinations of local interfaces do not result in combinations of global and local interfaces with identical names, because they cannot be equal and on the same level in their implementation.
    

Example

The following example shows how the statement INTERFACES can be used to compose and implement interfaces. Class c1 implements the composite interfaces i2 and i3. Although i1 is a component interface of i2 and i3, it exists only once in class c1. A reference variable iref1 of the static type i1 creates an object class c1 and calls the method i1~m1, which is implemented there.

INTERFACE i1.
¬†¬†METHODS m1.
ENDINTERFACE.
INTERFACE i2.
¬†¬†INTERFACES i1.
¬†¬†METHODS m2.
ENDINTERFACE.
INTERFACE i3.
¬†¬†INTERFACES i1.
¬†¬†METHODS m3.
ENDINTERFACE.
CLASS c1 DEFINITION.
¬†¬†PUBLIC SECTION.
¬†¬†¬†¬†INTERFACES: i2, i3.

¬†¬†¬†¬†...
¬†¬†ENDMETHOD.
¬†¬†METHOD i2~m2.
¬†¬†¬†¬†...
¬†¬†ENDMETHOD.
¬†¬†METHOD i3~m3.
¬†¬†¬†¬†...
¬†¬†ENDMETHOD.

ALIASES

[Short Reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapaliases_shortref.htm)

Syntax

ALIASES alias FOR intf~comp.

Effect

In the declaration part of a class or interface, this statement declares an alias name alias for a component comp of the interface intf. The [naming conventions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abennaming_conventions.htm) apply to the name alias. The interface intf must be implemented in the same class or included in the same interface. The alias name can be used anywhere, where it is visible, instead of intf~comp, to access the interface component comp.

An alias name is a component of the class and the interface. It is in the same namespace as the other components and is inherited by subclasses. In classes, an alias name can be declared in every [visibility section](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenvisibility_section_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Hints

-   Within a context, such as a class declaration or method, only one name should be used to access components. The syntax check issues a warning if both the alias name and the full name intf~meth are used together.

-   When implementing interface methods in the implementation part of classes using METHOD and when [re-defining](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenredefinition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") methods using METHODS ... REDEFINITION, the alias name can also be used.
    

Example

In the interfaces i2, i3 and the class c1, aliases are declared for the methods of the included or implemented interfaces. In the implementation part of the class, the interface methods in the [METHODS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods.htm) statements are implemented using the interface component selector. However ,the aliases of the classes could also be used here.

INTERFACE i1.
¬†¬†METHODS meth.
ENDINTERFACE.
INTERFACE i2.
¬†¬†INTERFACES i1.
¬†¬†ALIASES m1 FOR i1~meth.
¬†¬†METHODS meth.

¬†¬†INTERFACES i2.
¬†¬†ALIASES: m1 FOR i2~m1,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† m2 FOR i2~meth.

Effect

In the [public](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenpublic_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [visibility section](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenvisibility_section_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of a class, the statement INTERFACES implements the interface intf in the class. Additions can also be specified to determine the properties of interface components in the class.

All local or global interfaces that are visible here can be specified for intf that are not already included in a superclass of the current class. The components of the interfaces become public components of the class after the implementation. An interface component called comp has the name intf~comp in the class, where intf is the name of the interface and the character ~ is the interface component selector. A class must implement all methods of the interface in its implementation part, with the following exceptions:

-   Interface methods declared as optional using the addition [DEFAULT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods_default.htm).

-   Interface methods that are specified in the class after the addition ABSTRACT METHODS and are therefore declared as abstract.

-   Partial implementations are allowed in test classes using the addition [PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapinterfaces_partially.htm).

Hints

-   A class can implement any number of different interfaces. All of the interfaces implemented by a class are equal and on the same level. If an interface intf implemented in a class is a composite, that is, it contains component interfaces, these are implemented in the class like individual interfaces, regardless of their nesting hierarchy, and their components are addressed using the name of their component interface instead of using the name intf. It is generally not possible to use the interface component selector multiple times in a name (intf1~intf2~comp).
    

-   Each interface appears only once in a class and every interface component comp is always clearly accessible using the intf~comp. Even the components of an interface, which is the interface component of one or more other interface, and appears to be implemented multiple times in a class, only exist once.
    

-   If the implementation of a non-optional method of a global interface implemented using INTERFACES is missing in a class, a syntax warning occurs instead of a syntax error. This prevents classes from becoming unusable due to subsequent enhancements of global interfaces. Calling a missing implementation, however, always raises an exception of the class CX\_SY\_DYN\_CALL\_ILLEGAL\_METHOD and, if not handled, produces the runtime error CALL\_METHOD\_NOT\_IMPLEMENTED. A real syntax error is produced when local interfaces are used, and the implementation is missing.
    

-   If a class implements a method intf~... of a global interface intf implemented using INTERFACES in its implementation part and the method is not declared in the interface, a warning is raised by the syntax check. This type of method implementation is dead code that cannot be executed and should removed. Classes become unusable in the case of a syntax error if methods were later deleted from an implemented global interface, and which were implemented without a role in a class and had no values. An actual syntax error occurs when local interfaces are used.

Addition 1

... ABSTRACT METHODS meth1 meth2 ...

Addition 2

... FINAL METHODS meth1 meth2 ...

Effect

Using the additions ABSTRACT METHODS and FINAL METHODS, the individual instance methods meth of the interface can be made either abstract or final in the class to be implemented. The same rules apply as to the additions [ABSTRACT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods_abstract_final.htm) and [FINAL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods_abstract_final.htm) of the statement [METHODS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods.htm). In particular, the whole class must be abstract if an interface method is made abstract and at the same time no interface method can be listed after ABSTRACT METHODS and FINAL METHODS.

The following can be specified as methods meth1, meth2, ...

-   Instance methods that are declared in the interface intf itself.

-   Alias names declared in the interface intf for instance methods declared in interfaces that are included in intf.

-   Instance methods that are declared in interfaces bound in intf using the name of its own interface and the interface component selector (~). In this case the component interface cannot itself be included with the statement INTERFACES.

If an interface is included using multiple INTERFACES statements, the specifications in the additions FINAL and ABSTRACT must not produce contradictory definitions for a method.

Example

Definition of abstract methods when including two interfaces intf1 and intf2 in an abstract class cls.

INTERFACE intf1.
¬†¬†METHODS meth1.
ENDINTERFACE.
INTERFACE intf2.
¬†¬†INTERFACES intf1.
¬†¬†METHODS meth2.
ENDINTERFACE.
CLASS cls DEFINITION ABSTRACT.
¬†¬†PUBLIC SECTION.
¬†¬†¬†¬†INTERFACES intf1 ABSTRACT METHODS meth1.
¬†¬†¬†¬†INTERFACES intf2 ABSTRACT METHODS meth2.
ENDCLASS.

Example

Short form of the preceding example. Since intf2 includes the interface intf1, its methods can be specified as intf1~meth1. This means that a separate statement INTERFACES intf1 is no longer possible in this class.

INTERFACE intf1.
¬†¬†METHODS meth1.
ENDINTERFACE.
INTERFACE intf2.
¬†¬†INTERFACES intf1.
¬†¬†METHODS meth2.
ENDINTERFACE.
CLASS cls DEFINITION ABSTRACT.
¬†¬†PUBLIC SECTION.
¬†¬†¬†¬†INTERFACES intf2 ABSTRACT METHODS intf1~meth1 meth2.
ENDCLASS.

Addition 3

... ALL METHODS *{*ABSTRACT*|*FINAL*}*

Effect

Instead of making individual interface methods in the class abstract or final it is possible, using the addition ALL METHODS *{*ABSTRACT*|*FINAL*}*, to make all interface methods either [abstract](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods_abstract_final.htm) or [final](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods_abstract_final.htm).

Example

Implementation of an interface intf in an abstract class cls1, in which all methods are made abstract and must be implemented in a subclass cls2.

INTERFACE intf.
¬†¬†METHODS:
¬†¬†¬†¬†meth1,
¬†¬†¬†¬†meth2.
¬†¬†...
ENDINTERFACE.
CLASS cls1 DEFINITION ABSTRACT.
¬†¬†PUBLIC SECTION.
¬†¬†¬†¬†INTERFACES intf ALL METHODS ABSTRACT.
¬†¬†¬†¬†ALIASES:
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†meth1 FOR intf~meth1,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†meth2 FOR intf~meth2.
ENDCLASS.
CLASS cls2 DEFINITION INHERITING FROM cls1.
¬†¬†PUBLIC SECTION.
¬†¬†¬†¬†METHODS:
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†meth1 REDEFINITION,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†meth2 REDEFINITION.
ENDCLASS.
CLASS cls2 IMPLEMENTATION.
¬†¬†METHOD meth1.
¬†¬†¬†¬†...
¬†¬†ENDMETHOD.
¬†¬†METHOD meth2.
¬†¬†¬†¬†...
¬†¬†ENDMETHOD.
ENDCLASS.

Addition 4

... DATA VALUES attr1 = val1 attr2 = val2 ...

Effect

Using the addition DATA VALUES, initial values can be assigned to individual attributes attr. For attributes, this addition fulfills the same functions as the addition VALUE of the statement [DATA](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapdata.htm) for attributes in its own class.

The following can be specified as attributes attr1, attr2, ...

-   Attributes that are declared in the interface intf itself.

-   Alias names declared in the interface intf for attributes declared in interfaces that are included in intf.

-   Attributes that are declared in interfaces included in intf using the name of its own interface and the interface component selector (~). In this case the component interface cannot itself be included with the statement INTERFACES.

Constants declared in the interface or in a component interface with the statement [CONSTANTS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapconstants.htm) cannot be specified after the addition DATA VALUES.

Example

Implementation of an interface intf in a class cls, where the interface attributes are assigned start values.

INTERFACE intf.
¬†¬†CLASS-DATA:
¬†¬†¬†¬†attr1 TYPE string,
¬†¬†¬†¬†attr2 TYPE string.
¬†¬†...
ENDINTERFACE.
CLASS cls DEFINITION ABSTRACT.
¬†¬†PUBLIC SECTION.
¬†¬†¬†¬†INTERFACES intf
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†DATA VALUES attr1 = 'Hello'
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†attr2 = 'World'.
¬†¬†¬†¬†ALIASES:
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†attr1 FOR intf~attr1,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†attr2 FOR intf~attr2.
ENDCLASS.
START-OF-SELECTION.
¬†¬†cl\_demo\_output=>display( |{ cls=>attr1 } { cls=>attr2 }| ).

INTERFACES, composition

[Short Reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapinterfaces_shortref.htm)

Syntax

INTERFACES intf.

Effect

In the declaration of an interface, the statement INTERFACES includes the interface intf in the declared interface. Additions cannot be specified. As a result, the interface intf becomes a component interface of a composite interface.

An interface can be composed of any number of different component interfaces. All component interfaces are equal and on one level. If a component interface itself is a composite, that is, it contains its own component interfaces, the nesting hierarchy is irrelevant for the composition of the interface. It is relevant, however, for accessing the interface components.

To access the component comp of a component interface intf within a composite interface, the expression intf~comp can be used with the interface component selector (~). It is not possible to use the interface component selector multiple times in a name (intf1~intf2~comp). In a composite interface, it is possible to use the interface component selector to access only those interface components of the component interface that are included in this interface using the statement INTERFACES. Since all nested interfaces are at the same level, however, this is sufficient to access the interface components of all component interfaces using the name of their interface.

Hints

-   Each interface and its components appear only once in a composite interface. Even an interface that is seemingly implemented more than once in an interface, because it is an interface component of one or more other interfaces, really exists only once.

-   Since there are no separate namespaces for global and local interfaces, it must be ensured that combinations of local interfaces do not result in combinations of global and local interfaces with identical names, because they cannot be equal and on the same level in their implementation.
    

Example

The following example shows how the statement INTERFACES can be used to compose and implement interfaces. Class c1 implements the composite interfaces i2 and i3. Although i1 is a component interface of i2 and i3, it exists only once in class c1. A reference variable iref1 of the static type i1 creates an object class c1 and calls the method i1~m1, which is implemented there.

INTERFACE i1.
¬†¬†METHODS m1.
ENDINTERFACE.
INTERFACE i2.
¬†¬†INTERFACES i1.
¬†¬†METHODS m2.
ENDINTERFACE.
INTERFACE i3.
¬†¬†INTERFACES i1.
¬†¬†METHODS m3.

¬†¬†¬†¬†...
¬†¬†ENDMETHOD.
¬†¬†METHOD i3~m3.
¬†¬†¬†¬†...
¬†¬†ENDMETHOD.

ALIASES

[Short Reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapaliases_shortref.htm)

Syntax

ALIASES alias FOR intf~comp.

Effect

In the declaration part of a class or interface, this statement declares an alias name alias for a component comp of the interface intf. The [naming conventions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abennaming_conventions.htm) apply to the name alias. The interface intf must be implemented in the same class or included in the same interface. The alias name can be used anywhere, where it is visible, instead of intf~comp, to access the interface component comp.

An alias name is a component of the class and the interface. It is in the same namespace as the other components and is inherited by subclasses. In classes, an alias name can be declared in every [visibility section](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenvisibility_section_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Hints

-   Within a context, such as a class declaration or method, only one name should be used to access components. The syntax check issues a warning if both the alias name and the full name intf~meth are used together.

-   When implementing interface methods in the implementation part of classes using METHOD and when [re-defining](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenredefinition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") methods using METHODS ... REDEFINITION, the alias name can also be used.
    

Example

In the interfaces i2, i3 and the class c1, aliases are declared for the methods of the included or implemented interfaces. In the implementation part of the class, the interface methods in the [METHODS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods.htm) statements are implemented using the interface component selector. However ,the aliases of the classes could also be used here.

¬†¬†INTERFACES i1.
¬†¬†ALIASES m1 FOR i1~meth.

Effect

In the [public](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenpublic_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [visibility section](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenvisibility_section_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of a class, the statement INTERFACES implements the interface intf in the class. Additions can also be specified to determine the properties of interface components in the class.

All local or global interfaces that are visible here can be specified for intf that are not already included in a superclass of the current class. The components of the interfaces become public components of the class after the implementation. An interface component called comp has the name intf~comp in the class, where intf is the name of the interface and the character ~ is the interface component selector. A class must implement all methods of the interface in its implementation part, with the following exceptions:

-   Interface methods declared as optional using the addition [DEFAULT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods_default.htm).

-   Interface methods that are specified in the class after the addition ABSTRACT METHODS and are therefore declared as abstract.

-   Partial implementations are allowed in test classes using the addition [PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapinterfaces_partially.htm).

Hints

-   A class can implement any number of different interfaces. All of the interfaces implemented by a class are equal and on the same level. If an interface intf implemented in a class is a composite, that is, it contains component interfaces, these are implemented in the class like individual interfaces, regardless of their nesting hierarchy, and their components are addressed using the name of their component interface instead of using the name intf. It is generally not possible to use the interface component selector multiple times in a name (intf1~intf2~comp).
    

-   Each interface appears only once in a class and every interface component comp is always clearly accessible using the intf~comp. Even the components of an interface, which is the interface component of one or more other interface, and appears to be implemented multiple times in a class, only exist once.
    

-   If the implementation of a non-optional method of a global interface implemented using INTERFACES is missing in a class, a syntax warning occurs instead of a syntax error. This prevents classes from becoming unusable due to subsequent enhancements of global interfaces. Calling a missing implementation, however, always raises an exception of the class CX\_SY\_DYN\_CALL\_ILLEGAL\_METHOD and, if not handled, produces the runtime error CALL\_METHOD\_NOT\_IMPLEMENTED. A real syntax error is produced when local interfaces are used, and the implementation is missing.
    

-   If a class implements a method intf~... of a global interface intf implemented using INTERFACES in its implementation part and the method is not declared in the interface, a warning is raised by the syntax check. This type of method implementation is dead code that cannot be executed and should removed. Classes become unusable in the case of a syntax error if methods were later deleted from an implemented global interface, and which were implemented without a role in a class and had no values. An actual syntax error occurs when local interfaces are used.

Addition 1

... ABSTRACT METHODS meth1 meth2 ...

Addition 2

... FINAL METHODS meth1 meth2 ...

Effect

Using the additions ABSTRACT METHODS and FINAL METHODS, the individual instance methods meth of the interface can be made either abstract or final in the class to be implemented. The same rules apply as to the additions [ABSTRACT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods_abstract_final.htm) and [FINAL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods_abstract_final.htm) of the statement [METHODS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods.htm). In particular, the whole class must be abstract if an interface method is made abstract and at the same time no interface method can be listed after ABSTRACT METHODS and FINAL METHODS.

The following can be specified as methods meth1, meth2, ...

-   Instance methods that are declared in the interface intf itself.

-   Alias names declared in the interface intf for instance methods declared in interfaces that are included in intf.

-   Instance methods that are declared in interfaces bound in intf using the name of its own interface and the interface component selector (~). In this case the component interface cannot itself be included with the statement INTERFACES.

If an interface is included using multiple INTERFACES statements, the specifications in the additions FINAL and ABSTRACT must not produce contradictory definitions for a method.

Example

Definition of abstract methods when including two interfaces intf1 and intf2 in an abstract class cls.

INTERFACE intf1.
¬†¬†METHODS meth1.
ENDINTERFACE.
INTERFACE intf2.
¬†¬†INTERFACES intf1.
¬†¬†METHODS meth2.
ENDINTERFACE.
CLASS cls DEFINITION ABSTRACT.
¬†¬†PUBLIC SECTION.
¬†¬†¬†¬†INTERFACES intf1 ABSTRACT METHODS meth1.
¬†¬†¬†¬†INTERFACES intf2 ABSTRACT METHODS meth2.
ENDCLASS.

Example

Short form of the preceding example. Since intf2 includes the interface intf1, its methods can be specified as intf1~meth1. This means that a separate statement INTERFACES intf1 is no longer possible in this class.

INTERFACE intf1.
¬†¬†METHODS meth1.
ENDINTERFACE.
INTERFACE intf2.
¬†¬†INTERFACES intf1.
¬†¬†METHODS meth2.
ENDINTERFACE.
CLASS cls DEFINITION ABSTRACT.
¬†¬†PUBLIC SECTION.
¬†¬†¬†¬†INTERFACES intf2 ABSTRACT METHODS intf1~meth1 meth2.
ENDCLASS.

Addition 3

... ALL METHODS *{*ABSTRACT*|*FINAL*}*

Effect

Instead of making individual interface methods in the class abstract or final it is possible, using the addition ALL METHODS *{*ABSTRACT*|*FINAL*}*, to make all interface methods either [abstract](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods_abstract_final.htm) or [final](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods_abstract_final.htm).

Example

Implementation of an interface intf in an abstract class cls1, in which all methods are made abstract and must be implemented in a subclass cls2.

INTERFACE intf.
¬†¬†METHODS:
¬†¬†¬†¬†meth1,
¬†¬†¬†¬†meth2.
¬†¬†...
ENDINTERFACE.
CLASS cls1 DEFINITION ABSTRACT.
¬†¬†PUBLIC SECTION.
¬†¬†¬†¬†INTERFACES intf ALL METHODS ABSTRACT.
¬†¬†¬†¬†ALIASES:
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†meth1 FOR intf~meth1,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†meth2 FOR intf~meth2.
ENDCLASS.
CLASS cls2 DEFINITION INHERITING FROM cls1.
¬†¬†PUBLIC SECTION.
¬†¬†¬†¬†METHODS:
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†meth1 REDEFINITION,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†meth2 REDEFINITION.
ENDCLASS.
CLASS cls2 IMPLEMENTATION.
¬†¬†METHOD meth1.
¬†¬†¬†¬†...
¬†¬†ENDMETHOD.
¬†¬†METHOD meth2.
¬†¬†¬†¬†...
¬†¬†ENDMETHOD.
ENDCLASS.

Addition 4

... DATA VALUES attr1 = val1 attr2 = val2 ...

Effect

Using the addition DATA VALUES, initial values can be assigned to individual attributes attr. For attributes, this addition fulfills the same functions as the addition VALUE of the statement [DATA](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapdata.htm) for attributes in its own class.

The following can be specified as attributes attr1, attr2, ...

-   Attributes that are declared in the interface intf itself.

-   Alias names declared in the interface intf for attributes declared in interfaces that are included in intf.

-   Attributes that are declared in interfaces included in intf using the name of its own interface and the interface component selector (~). In this case the component interface cannot itself be included with the statement INTERFACES.

Constants declared in the interface or in a component interface with the statement [CONSTANTS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapconstants.htm) cannot be specified after the addition DATA VALUES.

Example

Implementation of an interface intf in a class cls, where the interface attributes are assigned start values.

INTERFACE intf.
¬†¬†CLASS-DATA:
¬†¬†¬†¬†attr1 TYPE string,
¬†¬†¬†¬†attr2 TYPE string.
¬†¬†...
ENDINTERFACE.
CLASS cls DEFINITION ABSTRACT.
¬†¬†PUBLIC SECTION.
¬†¬†¬†¬†INTERFACES intf
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†DATA VALUES attr1 = 'Hello'
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†attr2 = 'World'.
¬†¬†¬†¬†ALIASES:
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†attr1 FOR intf~attr1,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†attr2 FOR intf~attr2.
ENDCLASS.
START-OF-SELECTION.
¬†¬†cl\_demo\_output=>display( |{ cls=>attr1 } { cls=>attr2 }| ).

INTERFACES, composition

[Short Reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapinterfaces_shortref.htm)

Syntax

INTERFACES intf.

Effect

In the declaration of an interface, the statement INTERFACES includes the interface intf in the declared interface. Additions cannot be specified. As a result, the interface intf becomes a component interface of a composite interface.

An interface can be composed of any number of different component interfaces. All component interfaces are equal and on one level. If a component interface itself is a composite, that is, it contains its own component interfaces, the nesting hierarchy is irrelevant for the composition of the interface. It is relevant, however, for accessing the interface components.

To access the component comp of a component interface intf within a composite interface, the expression intf~comp can be used with the interface component selector (~). It is not possible to use the interface component selector multiple times in a name (intf1~intf2~comp). In a composite interface, it is possible to use the interface component selector to access only those interface components of the component interface that are included in this interface using the statement INTERFACES. Since all nested interfaces are at the same level, however, this is sufficient to access the interface components of all component interfaces using the name of their interface.

Hints

-   Each interface and its components appear only once in a composite interface. Even an interface that is seemingly implemented more than once in an interface, because it is an interface component of one or more other interfaces, really exists only once.

-   Since there are no separate namespaces for global and local interfaces, it must be ensured that combinations of local interfaces do not result in combinations of global and local interfaces with identical names, because they cannot be equal and on the same level in their implementation.
    

Example

The following example shows how the statement INTERFACES can be used to compose and implement interfaces. Class c1 implements the composite interfaces i2 and i3. Although i1 is a component interface of i2 and i3, it exists only once in class c1. A reference variable iref1 of the static type i1 creates an object class c1 and calls the method i1~m1, which is implemented there.

INTERFACE i1.
¬†¬†METHODS m1.
ENDINTERFACE.
INTERFACE i2.
¬†¬†INTERFACES i1.
¬†¬†METHODS m2.
ENDINTERFACE.
INTERFACE i3.
¬†¬†INTERFACES i1.

ALIASES

[Short Reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapaliases_shortref.htm)

Syntax

ALIASES alias FOR intf~comp.

Effect

In the declaration part of a class or interface, this statement declares an alias name alias for a component comp of the interface intf. The [naming conventions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abennaming_conventions.htm) apply to the name alias. The interface intf must be implemented in the same class or included in the same interface. The alias name can be used anywhere, where it is visible, instead of intf~comp, to access the interface component comp.

An alias name is a component of the class and the interface. It is in the same namespace as the other components and is inherited by subclasses. In classes, an alias name can be declared in every [visibility section](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenvisibility_section_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Hints

-   Within a context, such as a class declaration or method, only one name should be used to access components. The syntax check issues a warning if both the alias name and the full name intf~meth are used together.

-   When implementing interface methods in the implementation part of classes using METHOD and when [re-defining](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenredefinition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") methods using METHODS ... REDEFINITION, the alias name can also be used.
    

Example

In the interfaces i2, i3 and the class c1, aliases are declared for the methods of the included or implemented interfaces. In the implementation part of the class, the interface methods in the [METHODS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods.htm) statements are implemented using the interface component selector. However ,the aliases of the classes could also be used here.

¬†¬†INTERFACES i1.
¬†¬†ALIASES m1 FOR i1~meth.

[3\. ... ALL METHODS *{*ABSTRACT*|*FINAL*}*](#!ABAP_ADDITION_3@3@)
[4\. ... DATA VALUES attr1 = val1 attr2 = val2 ...](#!ABAP_ADDITION_4@4@)

Effect

In the [public](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenpublic_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [visibility section](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenvisibility_section_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of a class, the statement INTERFACES implements the interface intf in the class. Additions can also be specified to determine the properties of interface components in the class.

All local or global interfaces that are visible here can be specified for intf that are not already included in a superclass of the current class. The components of the interfaces become public components of the class after the implementation. An interface component called comp has the name intf~comp in the class, where intf is the name of the interface and the character ~ is the interface component selector. A class must implement all methods of the interface in its implementation part, with the following exceptions:

-   Interface methods declared as optional using the addition [DEFAULT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods_default.htm).

-   Interface methods that are specified in the class after the addition ABSTRACT METHODS and are therefore declared as abstract.

-   Partial implementations are allowed in test classes using the addition [PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapinterfaces_partially.htm).

Hints

-   A class can implement any number of different interfaces. All of the interfaces implemented by a class are equal and on the same level. If an interface intf implemented in a class is a composite, that is, it contains component interfaces, these are implemented in the class like individual interfaces, regardless of their nesting hierarchy, and their components are addressed using the name of their component interface instead of using the name intf. It is generally not possible to use the interface component selector multiple times in a name (intf1~intf2~comp).
    

-   Each interface appears only once in a class and every interface component comp is always clearly accessible using the intf~comp. Even the components of an interface, which is the interface component of one or more other interface, and appears to be implemented multiple times in a class, only exist once.
    

-   If the implementation of a non-optional method of a global interface implemented using INTERFACES is missing in a class, a syntax warning occurs instead of a syntax error. This prevents classes from becoming unusable due to subsequent enhancements of global interfaces. Calling a missing implementation, however, always raises an exception of the class CX\_SY\_DYN\_CALL\_ILLEGAL\_METHOD and, if not handled, produces the runtime error CALL\_METHOD\_NOT\_IMPLEMENTED. A real syntax error is produced when local interfaces are used, and the implementation is missing.
    

-   If a class implements a method intf~... of a global interface intf implemented using INTERFACES in its implementation part and the method is not declared in the interface, a warning is raised by the syntax check. This type of method implementation is dead code that cannot be executed and should removed. Classes become unusable in the case of a syntax error if methods were later deleted from an implemented global interface, and which were implemented without a role in a class and had no values. An actual syntax error occurs when local interfaces are used.

Implementation of an interface intf in a class cls.

Addition 1

... ABSTRACT METHODS meth1 meth2 ...

Addition 2

... FINAL METHODS meth1 meth2 ...

Effect

Using the additions ABSTRACT METHODS and FINAL METHODS, the individual instance methods meth of the interface can be made either abstract or final in the class to be implemented. The same rules apply as to the additions [ABSTRACT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods_abstract_final.htm) and [FINAL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods_abstract_final.htm) of the statement [METHODS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods.htm). In particular, the whole class must be abstract if an interface method is made abstract and at the same time no interface method can be listed after ABSTRACT METHODS and FINAL METHODS.

The following can be specified as methods meth1, meth2, ...

-   Instance methods that are declared in the interface intf itself.

-   Alias names declared in the interface intf for instance methods declared in interfaces that are included in intf.

-   Instance methods that are declared in interfaces bound in intf using the name of its own interface and the interface component selector (~). In this case the component interface cannot itself be included with the statement INTERFACES.

If an interface is included using multiple INTERFACES statements, the specifications in the additions FINAL and ABSTRACT must not produce contradictory definitions for a method.

Example

Definition of abstract methods when including two interfaces intf1 and intf2 in an abstract class cls.

INTERFACE intf1.
¬†¬†METHODS meth1.
ENDINTERFACE.
INTERFACE intf2.
¬†¬†INTERFACES intf1.
¬†¬†METHODS meth2.
ENDINTERFACE.
CLASS cls DEFINITION ABSTRACT.
¬†¬†PUBLIC SECTION.
¬†¬†¬†¬†INTERFACES intf1 ABSTRACT METHODS meth1.
¬†¬†¬†¬†INTERFACES intf2 ABSTRACT METHODS meth2.
ENDCLASS.

Example

Short form of the preceding example. Since intf2 includes the interface intf1, its methods can be specified as intf1~meth1. This means that a separate statement INTERFACES intf1 is no longer possible in this class.

INTERFACE intf1.
¬†¬†METHODS meth1.
ENDINTERFACE.
INTERFACE intf2.
¬†¬†INTERFACES intf1.
¬†¬†METHODS meth2.
ENDINTERFACE.
CLASS cls DEFINITION ABSTRACT.
¬†¬†PUBLIC SECTION.
¬†¬†¬†¬†INTERFACES intf2 ABSTRACT METHODS intf1~meth1 meth2.
ENDCLASS.

Addition 3

... ALL METHODS *{*ABSTRACT*|*FINAL*}*

Effect

Instead of making individual interface methods in the class abstract or final it is possible, using the addition ALL METHODS *{*ABSTRACT*|*FINAL*}*, to make all interface methods either [abstract](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods_abstract_final.htm) or [final](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods_abstract_final.htm).

Example

Implementation of an interface intf in an abstract class cls1, in which all methods are made abstract and must be implemented in a subclass cls2.

INTERFACE intf.
¬†¬†METHODS:
¬†¬†¬†¬†meth1,
¬†¬†¬†¬†meth2.
¬†¬†...
ENDINTERFACE.
CLASS cls1 DEFINITION ABSTRACT.
¬†¬†PUBLIC SECTION.
¬†¬†¬†¬†INTERFACES intf ALL METHODS ABSTRACT.
¬†¬†¬†¬†ALIASES:
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†meth1 FOR intf~meth1,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†meth2 FOR intf~meth2.
ENDCLASS.
CLASS cls2 DEFINITION INHERITING FROM cls1.
¬†¬†PUBLIC SECTION.
¬†¬†¬†¬†METHODS:
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†meth1 REDEFINITION,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†meth2 REDEFINITION.
ENDCLASS.
CLASS cls2 IMPLEMENTATION.
¬†¬†METHOD meth1.
¬†¬†¬†¬†...
¬†¬†ENDMETHOD.
¬†¬†METHOD meth2.
¬†¬†¬†¬†...
¬†¬†ENDMETHOD.
ENDCLASS.

Addition 4

... DATA VALUES attr1 = val1 attr2 = val2 ...

Effect

Using the addition DATA VALUES, initial values can be assigned to individual attributes attr. For attributes, this addition fulfills the same functions as the addition VALUE of the statement [DATA](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapdata.htm) for attributes in its own class.

The following can be specified as attributes attr1, attr2, ...

-   Attributes that are declared in the interface intf itself.

-   Alias names declared in the interface intf for attributes declared in interfaces that are included in intf.

-   Attributes that are declared in interfaces included in intf using the name of its own interface and the interface component selector (~). In this case the component interface cannot itself be included with the statement INTERFACES.

Constants declared in the interface or in a component interface with the statement [CONSTANTS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapconstants.htm) cannot be specified after the addition DATA VALUES.

Example

Implementation of an interface intf in a class cls, where the interface attributes are assigned start values.

INTERFACE intf.
¬†¬†CLASS-DATA:
¬†¬†¬†¬†attr1 TYPE string,
¬†¬†¬†¬†attr2 TYPE string.
¬†¬†...
ENDINTERFACE.
CLASS cls DEFINITION ABSTRACT.
¬†¬†PUBLIC SECTION.
¬†¬†¬†¬†INTERFACES intf

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†attr2 = 'World'.
¬†¬†¬†¬†ALIASES:
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†attr1 FOR intf~attr1,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†attr2 FOR intf~attr2.
ENDCLASS.
START-OF-SELECTION.
¬†¬†cl\_demo\_output=>display( |{ cls=>attr1 } { cls=>attr2 }| ).

INTERFACES, composition

[Short Reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapinterfaces_shortref.htm)

Syntax

INTERFACES intf.

Effect

In the declaration of an interface, the statement INTERFACES includes the interface intf in the declared interface. Additions cannot be specified. As a result, the interface intf becomes a component interface of a composite interface.

An interface can be composed of any number of different component interfaces. All component interfaces are equal and on one level. If a component interface itself is a composite, that is, it contains its own component interfaces, the nesting hierarchy is irrelevant for the composition of the interface. It is relevant, however, for accessing the interface components.

To access the component comp of a component interface intf within a composite interface, the expression intf~comp can be used with the interface component selector (~). It is not possible to use the interface component selector multiple times in a name (intf1~intf2~comp). In a composite interface, it is possible to use the interface component selector to access only those interface components of the component interface that are included in this interface using the statement INTERFACES. Since all nested interfaces are at the same level, however, this is sufficient to access the interface components of all component interfaces using the name of their interface.

Hints

-   Each interface and its components appear only once in a composite interface. Even an interface that is seemingly implemented more than once in an interface, because it is an interface component of one or more other interfaces, really exists only once.

-   Since there are no separate namespaces for global and local interfaces, it must be ensured that combinations of local interfaces do not result in combinations of global and local interfaces with identical names, because they cannot be equal and on the same level in their implementation.
    

Example

The following example shows how the statement INTERFACES can be used to compose and implement interfaces. Class c1 implements the composite interfaces i2 and i3. Although i1 is a component interface of i2 and i3, it exists only once in class c1. A reference variable iref1 of the static type i1 creates an object class c1 and calls the method i1~m1, which is implemented there.

ALIASES

[Short Reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapaliases_shortref.htm)

Syntax

ALIASES alias FOR intf~comp.

Effect

In the declaration part of a class or interface, this statement declares an alias name alias for a component comp of the interface intf. The [naming conventions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abennaming_conventions.htm) apply to the name alias. The interface intf must be implemented in the same class or included in the same interface. The alias name can be used anywhere, where it is visible, instead of intf~comp, to access the interface component comp.

An alias name is a component of the class and the interface. It is in the same namespace as the other components and is inherited by subclasses. In classes, an alias name can be declared in every [visibility section](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenvisibility_section_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Hints

-   Within a context, such as a class declaration or method, only one name should be used to access components. The syntax check issues a warning if both the alias name and the full name intf~meth are used together.

-   When implementing interface methods in the implementation part of classes using METHOD and when [re-defining](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenredefinition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") methods using METHODS ... REDEFINITION, the alias name can also be used.
    

Example

In the interfaces i2, i3 and the class c1, aliases are declared for the methods of the included or implemented interfaces. In the implementation part of the class, the interface methods in the [METHODS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods.htm) statements are implemented using the interface component selector. However ,the aliases of the classes could also be used here.

INTERFACE i1.
¬†¬†METHODS meth.
ENDINTERFACE.
INTERFACE i2.
¬†¬†INTERFACES i1.
¬†¬†ALIASES m1 FOR i1~meth.
¬†¬†METHODS meth.
ENDINTERFACE.

¬†¬†INTERFACES i2.
¬†¬†ALIASES: m1 FOR i2~m1,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† m2 FOR i2~meth.

Effect

In the [public](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenpublic_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [visibility section](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenvisibility_section_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of a class, the statement INTERFACES implements the interface intf in the class. Additions can also be specified to determine the properties of interface components in the class.

All local or global interfaces that are visible here can be specified for intf that are not already included in a superclass of the current class. The components of the interfaces become public components of the class after the implementation. An interface component called comp has the name intf~comp in the class, where intf is the name of the interface and the character ~ is the interface component selector. A class must implement all methods of the interface in its implementation part, with the following exceptions:

-   Interface methods declared as optional using the addition [DEFAULT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods_default.htm).

-   Interface methods that are specified in the class after the addition ABSTRACT METHODS and are therefore declared as abstract.

-   Partial implementations are allowed in test classes using the addition [PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapinterfaces_partially.htm).

Hints

-   A class can implement any number of different interfaces. All of the interfaces implemented by a class are equal and on the same level. If an interface intf implemented in a class is a composite, that is, it contains component interfaces, these are implemented in the class like individual interfaces, regardless of their nesting hierarchy, and their components are addressed using the name of their component interface instead of using the name intf. It is generally not possible to use the interface component selector multiple times in a name (intf1~intf2~comp).
    

-   Each interface appears only once in a class and every interface component comp is always clearly accessible using the intf~comp. Even the components of an interface, which is the interface component of one or more other interface, and appears to be implemented multiple times in a class, only exist once.
    

-   If the implementation of a non-optional method of a global interface implemented using INTERFACES is missing in a class, a syntax warning occurs instead of a syntax error. This prevents classes from becoming unusable due to subsequent enhancements of global interfaces. Calling a missing implementation, however, always raises an exception of the class CX\_SY\_DYN\_CALL\_ILLEGAL\_METHOD and, if not handled, produces the runtime error CALL\_METHOD\_NOT\_IMPLEMENTED. A real syntax error is produced when local interfaces are used, and the implementation is missing.
    

-   If a class implements a method intf~... of a global interface intf implemented using INTERFACES in its implementation part and the method is not declared in the interface, a warning is raised by the syntax check. This type of method implementation is dead code that cannot be executed and should removed. Classes become unusable in the case of a syntax error if methods were later deleted from an implemented global interface, and which were implemented without a role in a class and had no values. An actual syntax error occurs when local interfaces are used.

Using the additions ABSTRACT METHODS and FINAL METHODS, the individual instance methods meth of the interface can be made either abstract or final in the class to be implemented. The same rules apply as to the additions [ABSTRACT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods_abstract_final.htm) and [FINAL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods_abstract_final.htm) of the statement [METHODS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods.htm). In particular, the whole class must be abstract if an interface method is made abstract and at the same time no interface method can be listed after ABSTRACT METHODS and FINAL METHODS.

The following can be specified as methods meth1, meth2, ...

-   Instance methods that are declared in the interface intf itself.

-   Alias names declared in the interface intf for instance methods declared in interfaces that are included in intf.

-   Instance methods that are declared in interfaces bound in intf using the name of its own interface and the interface component selector (~). In this case the component interface cannot itself be included with the statement INTERFACES.

If an interface is included using multiple INTERFACES statements, the specifications in the additions FINAL and ABSTRACT must not produce contradictory definitions for a method.

Example

Definition of abstract methods when including two interfaces intf1 and intf2 in an abstract class cls.

INTERFACE intf1.
¬†¬†METHODS meth1.
ENDINTERFACE.
INTERFACE intf2.
¬†¬†INTERFACES intf1.
¬†¬†METHODS meth2.
ENDINTERFACE.
CLASS cls DEFINITION ABSTRACT.
¬†¬†PUBLIC SECTION.
¬†¬†¬†¬†INTERFACES intf1 ABSTRACT METHODS meth1.
¬†¬†¬†¬†INTERFACES intf2 ABSTRACT METHODS meth2.
ENDCLASS.

Example

Short form of the preceding example. Since intf2 includes the interface intf1, its methods can be specified as intf1~meth1. This means that a separate statement INTERFACES intf1 is no longer possible in this class.

INTERFACE intf1.
¬†¬†METHODS meth1.
ENDINTERFACE.
INTERFACE intf2.
¬†¬†INTERFACES intf1.
¬†¬†METHODS meth2.
ENDINTERFACE.
CLASS cls DEFINITION ABSTRACT.
¬†¬†PUBLIC SECTION.
¬†¬†¬†¬†INTERFACES intf2 ABSTRACT METHODS intf1~meth1 meth2.
ENDCLASS.

Addition 3

... ALL METHODS *{*ABSTRACT*|*FINAL*}*

Effect

Instead of making individual interface methods in the class abstract or final it is possible, using the addition ALL METHODS *{*ABSTRACT*|*FINAL*}*, to make all interface methods either [abstract](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods_abstract_final.htm) or [final](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods_abstract_final.htm).

Example

Implementation of an interface intf in an abstract class cls1, in which all methods are made abstract and must be implemented in a subclass cls2.

INTERFACE intf.
¬†¬†METHODS:
¬†¬†¬†¬†meth1,
¬†¬†¬†¬†meth2.
¬†¬†...
ENDINTERFACE.
CLASS cls1 DEFINITION ABSTRACT.
¬†¬†PUBLIC SECTION.
¬†¬†¬†¬†INTERFACES intf ALL METHODS ABSTRACT.
¬†¬†¬†¬†ALIASES:
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†meth1 FOR intf~meth1,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†meth2 FOR intf~meth2.
ENDCLASS.
CLASS cls2 DEFINITION INHERITING FROM cls1.
¬†¬†PUBLIC SECTION.
¬†¬†¬†¬†METHODS:
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†meth1 REDEFINITION,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†meth2 REDEFINITION.
ENDCLASS.
CLASS cls2 IMPLEMENTATION.
¬†¬†METHOD meth1.
¬†¬†¬†¬†...
¬†¬†ENDMETHOD.
¬†¬†METHOD meth2.
¬†¬†¬†¬†...
¬†¬†ENDMETHOD.
ENDCLASS.

Addition 4

... DATA VALUES attr1 = val1 attr2 = val2 ...

Effect

Using the addition DATA VALUES, initial values can be assigned to individual attributes attr. For attributes, this addition fulfills the same functions as the addition VALUE of the statement [DATA](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapdata.htm) for attributes in its own class.

The following can be specified as attributes attr1, attr2, ...

-   Attributes that are declared in the interface intf itself.

-   Alias names declared in the interface intf for attributes declared in interfaces that are included in intf.

-   Attributes that are declared in interfaces included in intf using the name of its own interface and the interface component selector (~). In this case the component interface cannot itself be included with the statement INTERFACES.

Constants declared in the interface or in a component interface with the statement [CONSTANTS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapconstants.htm) cannot be specified after the addition DATA VALUES.

Example

Implementation of an interface intf in a class cls, where the interface attributes are assigned start values.

INTERFACE intf.
¬†¬†CLASS-DATA:
¬†¬†¬†¬†attr1 TYPE string,
¬†¬†¬†¬†attr2 TYPE string.
¬†¬†...
ENDINTERFACE.
CLASS cls DEFINITION ABSTRACT.
¬†¬†PUBLIC SECTION.
¬†¬†¬†¬†INTERFACES intf
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†DATA VALUES attr1 = 'Hello'
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†attr2 = 'World'.
¬†¬†¬†¬†ALIASES:
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†attr1 FOR intf~attr1,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†attr2 FOR intf~attr2.
ENDCLASS.
START-OF-SELECTION.
¬†¬†cl\_demo\_output=>display( |{ cls=>attr1 } { cls=>attr2 }| ).

INTERFACES, composition

[Short Reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapinterfaces_shortref.htm)

Syntax

INTERFACES intf.

Effect

In the declaration of an interface, the statement INTERFACES includes the interface intf in the declared interface. Additions cannot be specified. As a result, the interface intf becomes a component interface of a composite interface.

An interface can be composed of any number of different component interfaces. All component interfaces are equal and on one level. If a component interface itself is a composite, that is, it contains its own component interfaces, the nesting hierarchy is irrelevant for the composition of the interface. It is relevant, however, for accessing the interface components.

To access the component comp of a component interface intf within a composite interface, the expression intf~comp can be used with the interface component selector (~). It is not possible to use the interface component selector multiple times in a name (intf1~intf2~comp). In a composite interface, it is possible to use the interface component selector to access only those interface components of the component interface that are included in this interface using the statement INTERFACES. Since all nested interfaces are at the same level, however, this is sufficient to access the interface components of all component interfaces using the name of their interface.

Hints

-   Each interface and its components appear only once in a composite interface. Even an interface that is seemingly implemented more than once in an interface, because it is an interface component of one or more other interfaces, really exists only once.

-   Since there are no separate namespaces for global and local interfaces, it must be ensured that combinations of local interfaces do not result in combinations of global and local interfaces with identical names, because they cannot be equal and on the same level in their implementation.
    

Example

The following example shows how the statement INTERFACES can be used to compose and implement interfaces. Class c1 implements the composite interfaces i2 and i3. Although i1 is a component interface of i2 and i3, it exists only once in class c1. A reference variable iref1 of the static type i1 creates an object class c1 and calls the method i1~m1, which is implemented there.

INTERFACE i1.
¬†¬†METHODS m1.
ENDINTERFACE.
INTERFACE i2.
¬†¬†INTERFACES i1.
¬†¬†METHODS m2.
ENDINTERFACE.
INTERFACE i3.
¬†¬†INTERFACES i1.
¬†¬†METHODS m3.
ENDINTERFACE.
CLASS c1 DEFINITION.
¬†¬†PUBLIC SECTION.
¬†¬†¬†¬†INTERFACES: i2, i3.
ENDCLASS.

¬†¬†¬†¬†...
¬†¬†ENDMETHOD.
¬†¬†METHOD i2~m2.
¬†¬†¬†¬†...
¬†¬†ENDMETHOD.
¬†¬†METHOD i3~m3.
¬†¬†¬†¬†...
¬†¬†ENDMETHOD.

ALIASES

[Short Reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapaliases_shortref.htm)

Syntax

ALIASES alias FOR intf~comp.

Effect

In the declaration part of a class or interface, this statement declares an alias name alias for a component comp of the interface intf. The [naming conventions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abennaming_conventions.htm) apply to the name alias. The interface intf must be implemented in the same class or included in the same interface. The alias name can be used anywhere, where it is visible, instead of intf~comp, to access the interface component comp.

An alias name is a component of the class and the interface. It is in the same namespace as the other components and is inherited by subclasses. In classes, an alias name can be declared in every [visibility section](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenvisibility_section_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Hints

-   Within a context, such as a class declaration or method, only one name should be used to access components. The syntax check issues a warning if both the alias name and the full name intf~meth are used together.

-   When implementing interface methods in the implementation part of classes using METHOD and when [re-defining](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenredefinition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") methods using METHODS ... REDEFINITION, the alias name can also be used.
    

Example

In the interfaces i2, i3 and the class c1, aliases are declared for the methods of the included or implemented interfaces. In the implementation part of the class, the interface methods in the [METHODS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods.htm) statements are implemented using the interface component selector. However ,the aliases of the classes could also be used here.

INTERFACE i1.
¬†¬†METHODS meth.
ENDINTERFACE.
INTERFACE i2.
¬†¬†INTERFACES i1.
¬†¬†ALIASES m1 FOR i1~meth.
¬†¬†METHODS meth.

¬†¬†ALIASES: m1 FOR i2~m1,

Effect

In the [public](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenpublic_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [visibility section](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenvisibility_section_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of a class, the statement INTERFACES implements the interface intf in the class. Additions can also be specified to determine the properties of interface components in the class.

All local or global interfaces that are visible here can be specified for intf that are not already included in a superclass of the current class. The components of the interfaces become public components of the class after the implementation. An interface component called comp has the name intf~comp in the class, where intf is the name of the interface and the character ~ is the interface component selector. A class must implement all methods of the interface in its implementation part, with the following exceptions:

-   Interface methods declared as optional using the addition [DEFAULT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods_default.htm).

-   Interface methods that are specified in the class after the addition ABSTRACT METHODS and are therefore declared as abstract.

-   Partial implementations are allowed in test classes using the addition [PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapinterfaces_partially.htm).

Hints

-   A class can implement any number of different interfaces. All of the interfaces implemented by a class are equal and on the same level. If an interface intf implemented in a class is a composite, that is, it contains component interfaces, these are implemented in the class like individual interfaces, regardless of their nesting hierarchy, and their components are addressed using the name of their component interface instead of using the name intf. It is generally not possible to use the interface component selector multiple times in a name (intf1~intf2~comp).
    

-   Each interface appears only once in a class and every interface component comp is always clearly accessible using the intf~comp. Even the components of an interface, which is the interface component of one or more other interface, and appears to be implemented multiple times in a class, only exist once.
    

-   If the implementation of a non-optional method of a global interface implemented using INTERFACES is missing in a class, a syntax warning occurs instead of a syntax error. This prevents classes from becoming unusable due to subsequent enhancements of global interfaces. Calling a missing implementation, however, always raises an exception of the class CX\_SY\_DYN\_CALL\_ILLEGAL\_METHOD and, if not handled, produces the runtime error CALL\_METHOD\_NOT\_IMPLEMENTED. A real syntax error is produced when local interfaces are used, and the implementation is missing.
    

-   If a class implements a method intf~... of a global interface intf implemented using INTERFACES in its implementation part and the method is not declared in the interface, a warning is raised by the syntax check. This type of method implementation is dead code that cannot be executed and should removed. Classes become unusable in the case of a syntax error if methods were later deleted from an implemented global interface, and which were implemented without a role in a class and had no values. An actual syntax error occurs when local interfaces are used.

Addition 1

... ABSTRACT METHODS meth1 meth2 ...

Addition 2

... FINAL METHODS meth1 meth2 ...

Effect

Using the additions ABSTRACT METHODS and FINAL METHODS, the individual instance methods meth of the interface can be made either abstract or final in the class to be implemented. The same rules apply as to the additions [ABSTRACT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods_abstract_final.htm) and [FINAL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods_abstract_final.htm) of the statement [METHODS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods.htm). In particular, the whole class must be abstract if an interface method is made abstract and at the same time no interface method can be listed after ABSTRACT METHODS and FINAL METHODS.

The following can be specified as methods meth1, meth2, ...

-   Instance methods that are declared in the interface intf itself.

-   Alias names declared in the interface intf for instance methods declared in interfaces that are included in intf.

-   Instance methods that are declared in interfaces bound in intf using the name of its own interface and the interface component selector (~). In this case the component interface cannot itself be included with the statement INTERFACES.

If an interface is included using multiple INTERFACES statements, the specifications in the additions FINAL and ABSTRACT must not produce contradictory definitions for a method.

Example

Definition of abstract methods when including two interfaces intf1 and intf2 in an abstract class cls.

INTERFACE intf1.
¬†¬†METHODS meth1.
ENDINTERFACE.
INTERFACE intf2.
¬†¬†INTERFACES intf1.
¬†¬†METHODS meth2.
ENDINTERFACE.
CLASS cls DEFINITION ABSTRACT.
¬†¬†PUBLIC SECTION.
¬†¬†¬†¬†INTERFACES intf1 ABSTRACT METHODS meth1.
¬†¬†¬†¬†INTERFACES intf2 ABSTRACT METHODS meth2.
ENDCLASS.

Example

Short form of the preceding example. Since intf2 includes the interface intf1, its methods can be specified as intf1~meth1. This means that a separate statement INTERFACES intf1 is no longer possible in this class.

INTERFACE intf1.
¬†¬†METHODS meth1.
ENDINTERFACE.
INTERFACE intf2.
¬†¬†INTERFACES intf1.
¬†¬†METHODS meth2.
ENDINTERFACE.
CLASS cls DEFINITION ABSTRACT.
¬†¬†PUBLIC SECTION.
¬†¬†¬†¬†INTERFACES intf2 ABSTRACT METHODS intf1~meth1 meth2.
ENDCLASS.

Addition 3

... ALL METHODS *{*ABSTRACT*|*FINAL*}*

Effect

Instead of making individual interface methods in the class abstract or final it is possible, using the addition ALL METHODS *{*ABSTRACT*|*FINAL*}*, to make all interface methods either [abstract](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods_abstract_final.htm) or [final](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods_abstract_final.htm).

Example

Implementation of an interface intf in an abstract class cls1, in which all methods are made abstract and must be implemented in a subclass cls2.

INTERFACE intf.
¬†¬†METHODS:
¬†¬†¬†¬†meth1,
¬†¬†¬†¬†meth2.
¬†¬†...
ENDINTERFACE.
CLASS cls1 DEFINITION ABSTRACT.
¬†¬†PUBLIC SECTION.
¬†¬†¬†¬†INTERFACES intf ALL METHODS ABSTRACT.
¬†¬†¬†¬†ALIASES:
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†meth1 FOR intf~meth1,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†meth2 FOR intf~meth2.
ENDCLASS.
CLASS cls2 DEFINITION INHERITING FROM cls1.
¬†¬†PUBLIC SECTION.
¬†¬†¬†¬†METHODS:
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†meth1 REDEFINITION,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†meth2 REDEFINITION.
ENDCLASS.
CLASS cls2 IMPLEMENTATION.
¬†¬†METHOD meth1.
¬†¬†¬†¬†...
¬†¬†ENDMETHOD.
¬†¬†METHOD meth2.
¬†¬†¬†¬†...
¬†¬†ENDMETHOD.
ENDCLASS.

Addition 4

... DATA VALUES attr1 = val1 attr2 = val2 ...

Effect

Using the addition DATA VALUES, initial values can be assigned to individual attributes attr. For attributes, this addition fulfills the same functions as the addition VALUE of the statement [DATA](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapdata.htm) for attributes in its own class.

The following can be specified as attributes attr1, attr2, ...

-   Attributes that are declared in the interface intf itself.

-   Alias names declared in the interface intf for attributes declared in interfaces that are included in intf.

-   Attributes that are declared in interfaces included in intf using the name of its own interface and the interface component selector (~). In this case the component interface cannot itself be included with the statement INTERFACES.

Constants declared in the interface or in a component interface with the statement [CONSTANTS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapconstants.htm) cannot be specified after the addition DATA VALUES.

Example

Implementation of an interface intf in a class cls, where the interface attributes are assigned start values.

INTERFACE intf.
¬†¬†CLASS-DATA:
¬†¬†¬†¬†attr1 TYPE string,
¬†¬†¬†¬†attr2 TYPE string.
¬†¬†...
ENDINTERFACE.
CLASS cls DEFINITION ABSTRACT.
¬†¬†PUBLIC SECTION.
¬†¬†¬†¬†INTERFACES intf
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†DATA VALUES attr1 = 'Hello'
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†attr2 = 'World'.
¬†¬†¬†¬†ALIASES:
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†attr1 FOR intf~attr1,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†attr2 FOR intf~attr2.
ENDCLASS.
START-OF-SELECTION.
¬†¬†cl\_demo\_output=>display( |{ cls=>attr1 } { cls=>attr2 }| ).

INTERFACES, composition

[Short Reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapinterfaces_shortref.htm)

Syntax

INTERFACES intf.

Effect

In the declaration of an interface, the statement INTERFACES includes the interface intf in the declared interface. Additions cannot be specified. As a result, the interface intf becomes a component interface of a composite interface.

An interface can be composed of any number of different component interfaces. All component interfaces are equal and on one level. If a component interface itself is a composite, that is, it contains its own component interfaces, the nesting hierarchy is irrelevant for the composition of the interface. It is relevant, however, for accessing the interface components.

To access the component comp of a component interface intf within a composite interface, the expression intf~comp can be used with the interface component selector (~). It is not possible to use the interface component selector multiple times in a name (intf1~intf2~comp). In a composite interface, it is possible to use the interface component selector to access only those interface components of the component interface that are included in this interface using the statement INTERFACES. Since all nested interfaces are at the same level, however, this is sufficient to access the interface components of all component interfaces using the name of their interface.

Hints

-   Each interface and its components appear only once in a composite interface. Even an interface that is seemingly implemented more than once in an interface, because it is an interface component of one or more other interfaces, really exists only once.

-   Since there are no separate namespaces for global and local interfaces, it must be ensured that combinations of local interfaces do not result in combinations of global and local interfaces with identical names, because they cannot be equal and on the same level in their implementation.
    

Example

The following example shows how the statement INTERFACES can be used to compose and implement interfaces. Class c1 implements the composite interfaces i2 and i3. Although i1 is a component interface of i2 and i3, it exists only once in class c1. A reference variable iref1 of the static type i1 creates an object class c1 and calls the method i1~m1, which is implemented there.

INTERFACE i1.
¬†¬†METHODS m1.
ENDINTERFACE.
INTERFACE i2.
¬†¬†INTERFACES i1.
¬†¬†METHODS m2.
ENDINTERFACE.
INTERFACE i3.
¬†¬†INTERFACES i1.
¬†¬†METHODS m3.

¬†¬†¬†¬†...
¬†¬†ENDMETHOD.
¬†¬†METHOD i3~m3.
¬†¬†¬†¬†...
¬†¬†ENDMETHOD.

ALIASES

[Short Reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapaliases_shortref.htm)

Syntax

ALIASES alias FOR intf~comp.

Effect

In the declaration part of a class or interface, this statement declares an alias name alias for a component comp of the interface intf. The [naming conventions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abennaming_conventions.htm) apply to the name alias. The interface intf must be implemented in the same class or included in the same interface. The alias name can be used anywhere, where it is visible, instead of intf~comp, to access the interface component comp.

An alias name is a component of the class and the interface. It is in the same namespace as the other components and is inherited by subclasses. In classes, an alias name can be declared in every [visibility section](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenvisibility_section_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Hints

-   Within a context, such as a class declaration or method, only one name should be used to access components. The syntax check issues a warning if both the alias name and the full name intf~meth are used together.

-   When implementing interface methods in the implementation part of classes using METHOD and when [re-defining](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenredefinition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") methods using METHODS ... REDEFINITION, the alias name can also be used.
    

Example

In the interfaces i2, i3 and the class c1, aliases are declared for the methods of the included or implemented interfaces. In the implementation part of the class, the interface methods in the [METHODS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods.htm) statements are implemented using the interface component selector. However ,the aliases of the classes could also be used here.

¬†¬†INTERFACES i1.
¬†¬†ALIASES m1 FOR i1~meth.

Effect

In the [public](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenpublic_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [visibility section](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenvisibility_section_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of a class, the statement INTERFACES implements the interface intf in the class. Additions can also be specified to determine the properties of interface components in the class.

All local or global interfaces that are visible here can be specified for intf that are not already included in a superclass of the current class. The components of the interfaces become public components of the class after the implementation. An interface component called comp has the name intf~comp in the class, where intf is the name of the interface and the character ~ is the interface component selector. A class must implement all methods of the interface in its implementation part, with the following exceptions:

-   Interface methods declared as optional using the addition [DEFAULT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods_default.htm).

-   Interface methods that are specified in the class after the addition ABSTRACT METHODS and are therefore declared as abstract.

-   Partial implementations are allowed in test classes using the addition [PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapinterfaces_partially.htm).

Hints

-   A class can implement any number of different interfaces. All of the interfaces implemented by a class are equal and on the same level. If an interface intf implemented in a class is a composite, that is, it contains component interfaces, these are implemented in the class like individual interfaces, regardless of their nesting hierarchy, and their components are addressed using the name of their component interface instead of using the name intf. It is generally not possible to use the interface component selector multiple times in a name (intf1~intf2~comp).
    

-   Each interface appears only once in a class and every interface component comp is always clearly accessible using the intf~comp. Even the components of an interface, which is the interface component of one or more other interface, and appears to be implemented multiple times in a class, only exist once.
    

-   If the implementation of a non-optional method of a global interface implemented using INTERFACES is missing in a class, a syntax warning occurs instead of a syntax error. This prevents classes from becoming unusable due to subsequent enhancements of global interfaces. Calling a missing implementation, however, always raises an exception of the class CX\_SY\_DYN\_CALL\_ILLEGAL\_METHOD and, if not handled, produces the runtime error CALL\_METHOD\_NOT\_IMPLEMENTED. A real syntax error is produced when local interfaces are used, and the implementation is missing.
    

-   If a class implements a method intf~... of a global interface intf implemented using INTERFACES in its implementation part and the method is not declared in the interface, a warning is raised by the syntax check. This type of method implementation is dead code that cannot be executed and should removed. Classes become unusable in the case of a syntax error if methods were later deleted from an implemented global interface, and which were implemented without a role in a class and had no values. An actual syntax error occurs when local interfaces are used.

Addition 1

... ABSTRACT METHODS meth1 meth2 ...

Addition 2

... FINAL METHODS meth1 meth2 ...

Effect

Using the additions ABSTRACT METHODS and FINAL METHODS, the individual instance methods meth of the interface can be made either abstract or final in the class to be implemented. The same rules apply as to the additions [ABSTRACT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods_abstract_final.htm) and [FINAL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods_abstract_final.htm) of the statement [METHODS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods.htm). In particular, the whole class must be abstract if an interface method is made abstract and at the same time no interface method can be listed after ABSTRACT METHODS and FINAL METHODS.

The following can be specified as methods meth1, meth2, ...

-   Instance methods that are declared in the interface intf itself.

-   Alias names declared in the interface intf for instance methods declared in interfaces that are included in intf.

-   Instance methods that are declared in interfaces bound in intf using the name of its own interface and the interface component selector (~). In this case the component interface cannot itself be included with the statement INTERFACES.

If an interface is included using multiple INTERFACES statements, the specifications in the additions FINAL and ABSTRACT must not produce contradictory definitions for a method.

Example

Definition of abstract methods when including two interfaces intf1 and intf2 in an abstract class cls.

INTERFACE intf1.
¬†¬†METHODS meth1.
ENDINTERFACE.
INTERFACE intf2.
¬†¬†INTERFACES intf1.
¬†¬†METHODS meth2.
ENDINTERFACE.
CLASS cls DEFINITION ABSTRACT.
¬†¬†PUBLIC SECTION.
¬†¬†¬†¬†INTERFACES intf1 ABSTRACT METHODS meth1.
¬†¬†¬†¬†INTERFACES intf2 ABSTRACT METHODS meth2.
ENDCLASS.

Example

Short form of the preceding example. Since intf2 includes the interface intf1, its methods can be specified as intf1~meth1. This means that a separate statement INTERFACES intf1 is no longer possible in this class.

INTERFACE intf1.
¬†¬†METHODS meth1.
ENDINTERFACE.
INTERFACE intf2.
¬†¬†INTERFACES intf1.
¬†¬†METHODS meth2.
ENDINTERFACE.
CLASS cls DEFINITION ABSTRACT.
¬†¬†PUBLIC SECTION.
¬†¬†¬†¬†INTERFACES intf2 ABSTRACT METHODS intf1~meth1 meth2.
ENDCLASS.

Addition 3

... ALL METHODS *{*ABSTRACT*|*FINAL*}*

Effect

Instead of making individual interface methods in the class abstract or final it is possible, using the addition ALL METHODS *{*ABSTRACT*|*FINAL*}*, to make all interface methods either [abstract](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods_abstract_final.htm) or [final](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods_abstract_final.htm).

Example

Implementation of an interface intf in an abstract class cls1, in which all methods are made abstract and must be implemented in a subclass cls2.

INTERFACE intf.
¬†¬†METHODS:
¬†¬†¬†¬†meth1,
¬†¬†¬†¬†meth2.
¬†¬†...
ENDINTERFACE.
CLASS cls1 DEFINITION ABSTRACT.
¬†¬†PUBLIC SECTION.
¬†¬†¬†¬†INTERFACES intf ALL METHODS ABSTRACT.
¬†¬†¬†¬†ALIASES:
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†meth1 FOR intf~meth1,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†meth2 FOR intf~meth2.
ENDCLASS.
CLASS cls2 DEFINITION INHERITING FROM cls1.
¬†¬†PUBLIC SECTION.
¬†¬†¬†¬†METHODS:
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†meth1 REDEFINITION,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†meth2 REDEFINITION.
ENDCLASS.
CLASS cls2 IMPLEMENTATION.
¬†¬†METHOD meth1.
¬†¬†¬†¬†...
¬†¬†ENDMETHOD.
¬†¬†METHOD meth2.
¬†¬†¬†¬†...
¬†¬†ENDMETHOD.
ENDCLASS.

Addition 4

... DATA VALUES attr1 = val1 attr2 = val2 ...

Effect

Using the addition DATA VALUES, initial values can be assigned to individual attributes attr. For attributes, this addition fulfills the same functions as the addition VALUE of the statement [DATA](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapdata.htm) for attributes in its own class.

The following can be specified as attributes attr1, attr2, ...

-   Attributes that are declared in the interface intf itself.

-   Alias names declared in the interface intf for attributes declared in interfaces that are included in intf.

-   Attributes that are declared in interfaces included in intf using the name of its own interface and the interface component selector (~). In this case the component interface cannot itself be included with the statement INTERFACES.

Constants declared in the interface or in a component interface with the statement [CONSTANTS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapconstants.htm) cannot be specified after the addition DATA VALUES.

Example

Implementation of an interface intf in a class cls, where the interface attributes are assigned start values.

INTERFACE intf.
¬†¬†CLASS-DATA:
¬†¬†¬†¬†attr1 TYPE string,
¬†¬†¬†¬†attr2 TYPE string.
¬†¬†...
ENDINTERFACE.
CLASS cls DEFINITION ABSTRACT.
¬†¬†PUBLIC SECTION.
¬†¬†¬†¬†INTERFACES intf
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†DATA VALUES attr1 = 'Hello'
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†attr2 = 'World'.
¬†¬†¬†¬†ALIASES:
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†attr1 FOR intf~attr1,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†attr2 FOR intf~attr2.
ENDCLASS.
START-OF-SELECTION.
¬†¬†cl\_demo\_output=>display( |{ cls=>attr1 } { cls=>attr2 }| ).

INTERFACES, composition

[Short Reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapinterfaces_shortref.htm)

Syntax

INTERFACES intf.

Effect

In the declaration of an interface, the statement INTERFACES includes the interface intf in the declared interface. Additions cannot be specified. As a result, the interface intf becomes a component interface of a composite interface.

An interface can be composed of any number of different component interfaces. All component interfaces are equal and on one level. If a component interface itself is a composite, that is, it contains its own component interfaces, the nesting hierarchy is irrelevant for the composition of the interface. It is relevant, however, for accessing the interface components.

To access the component comp of a component interface intf within a composite interface, the expression intf~comp can be used with the interface component selector (~). It is not possible to use the interface component selector multiple times in a name (intf1~intf2~comp). In a composite interface, it is possible to use the interface component selector to access only those interface components of the component interface that are included in this interface using the statement INTERFACES. Since all nested interfaces are at the same level, however, this is sufficient to access the interface components of all component interfaces using the name of their interface.

Hints

-   Each interface and its components appear only once in a composite interface. Even an interface that is seemingly implemented more than once in an interface, because it is an interface component of one or more other interfaces, really exists only once.

-   Since there are no separate namespaces for global and local interfaces, it must be ensured that combinations of local interfaces do not result in combinations of global and local interfaces with identical names, because they cannot be equal and on the same level in their implementation.
    

Example

The following example shows how the statement INTERFACES can be used to compose and implement interfaces. Class c1 implements the composite interfaces i2 and i3. Although i1 is a component interface of i2 and i3, it exists only once in class c1. A reference variable iref1 of the static type i1 creates an object class c1 and calls the method i1~m1, which is implemented there.

INTERFACE i1.
¬†¬†METHODS m1.
ENDINTERFACE.
INTERFACE i2.
¬†¬†INTERFACES i1.
¬†¬†METHODS m2.
ENDINTERFACE.
INTERFACE i3.
¬†¬†INTERFACES i1.

ALIASES

[Short Reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapaliases_shortref.htm)

Syntax

ALIASES alias FOR intf~comp.

Effect

In the declaration part of a class or interface, this statement declares an alias name alias for a component comp of the interface intf. The [naming conventions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abennaming_conventions.htm) apply to the name alias. The interface intf must be implemented in the same class or included in the same interface. The alias name can be used anywhere, where it is visible, instead of intf~comp, to access the interface component comp.

An alias name is a component of the class and the interface. It is in the same namespace as the other components and is inherited by subclasses. In classes, an alias name can be declared in every [visibility section](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenvisibility_section_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Hints

-   Within a context, such as a class declaration or method, only one name should be used to access components. The syntax check issues a warning if both the alias name and the full name intf~meth are used together.

-   When implementing interface methods in the implementation part of classes using METHOD and when [re-defining](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenredefinition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") methods using METHODS ... REDEFINITION, the alias name can also be used.
    

Example

In the interfaces i2, i3 and the class c1, aliases are declared for the methods of the included or implemented interfaces. In the implementation part of the class, the interface methods in the [METHODS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods.htm) statements are implemented using the interface component selector. However ,the aliases of the classes could also be used here.

[4\. ... DATA VALUES attr1 = val1 attr2 = val2 ...](#!ABAP_ADDITION_4@4@)

Effect

In the [public](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenpublic_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [visibility section](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenvisibility_section_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of a class, the statement INTERFACES implements the interface intf in the class. Additions can also be specified to determine the properties of interface components in the class.

All local or global interfaces that are visible here can be specified for intf that are not already included in a superclass of the current class. The components of the interfaces become public components of the class after the implementation. An interface component called comp has the name intf~comp in the class, where intf is the name of the interface and the character ~ is the interface component selector. A class must implement all methods of the interface in its implementation part, with the following exceptions:

-   Interface methods declared as optional using the addition [DEFAULT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods_default.htm).

-   Interface methods that are specified in the class after the addition ABSTRACT METHODS and are therefore declared as abstract.

-   Partial implementations are allowed in test classes using the addition [PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapinterfaces_partially.htm).

Hints

-   A class can implement any number of different interfaces. All of the interfaces implemented by a class are equal and on the same level. If an interface intf implemented in a class is a composite, that is, it contains component interfaces, these are implemented in the class like individual interfaces, regardless of their nesting hierarchy, and their components are addressed using the name of their component interface instead of using the name intf. It is generally not possible to use the interface component selector multiple times in a name (intf1~intf2~comp).
    

-   Each interface appears only once in a class and every interface component comp is always clearly accessible using the intf~comp. Even the components of an interface, which is the interface component of one or more other interface, and appears to be implemented multiple times in a class, only exist once.
    

-   If the implementation of a non-optional method of a global interface implemented using INTERFACES is missing in a class, a syntax warning occurs instead of a syntax error. This prevents classes from becoming unusable due to subsequent enhancements of global interfaces. Calling a missing implementation, however, always raises an exception of the class CX\_SY\_DYN\_CALL\_ILLEGAL\_METHOD and, if not handled, produces the runtime error CALL\_METHOD\_NOT\_IMPLEMENTED. A real syntax error is produced when local interfaces are used, and the implementation is missing.
    

-   If a class implements a method intf~... of a global interface intf implemented using INTERFACES in its implementation part and the method is not declared in the interface, a warning is raised by the syntax check. This type of method implementation is dead code that cannot be executed and should removed. Classes become unusable in the case of a syntax error if methods were later deleted from an implemented global interface, and which were implemented without a role in a class and had no values. An actual syntax error occurs when local interfaces are used.

Addition 1

... ABSTRACT METHODS meth1 meth2 ...

Addition 2

... FINAL METHODS meth1 meth2 ...

Effect

Using the additions ABSTRACT METHODS and FINAL METHODS, the individual instance methods meth of the interface can be made either abstract or final in the class to be implemented. The same rules apply as to the additions [ABSTRACT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods_abstract_final.htm) and [FINAL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods_abstract_final.htm) of the statement [METHODS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods.htm). In particular, the whole class must be abstract if an interface method is made abstract and at the same time no interface method can be listed after ABSTRACT METHODS and FINAL METHODS.

The following can be specified as methods meth1, meth2, ...

-   Instance methods that are declared in the interface intf itself.

-   Alias names declared in the interface intf for instance methods declared in interfaces that are included in intf.

-   Instance methods that are declared in interfaces bound in intf using the name of its own interface and the interface component selector (~). In this case the component interface cannot itself be included with the statement INTERFACES.

If an interface is included using multiple INTERFACES statements, the specifications in the additions FINAL and ABSTRACT must not produce contradictory definitions for a method.

Example

Definition of abstract methods when including two interfaces intf1 and intf2 in an abstract class cls.

INTERFACE intf1.
¬†¬†METHODS meth1.
ENDINTERFACE.
INTERFACE intf2.
¬†¬†INTERFACES intf1.
¬†¬†METHODS meth2.
ENDINTERFACE.
CLASS cls DEFINITION ABSTRACT.
¬†¬†PUBLIC SECTION.
¬†¬†¬†¬†INTERFACES intf1 ABSTRACT METHODS meth1.
¬†¬†¬†¬†INTERFACES intf2 ABSTRACT METHODS meth2.
ENDCLASS.

Example

Short form of the preceding example. Since intf2 includes the interface intf1, its methods can be specified as intf1~meth1. This means that a separate statement INTERFACES intf1 is no longer possible in this class.

INTERFACE intf1.
¬†¬†METHODS meth1.
ENDINTERFACE.
INTERFACE intf2.
¬†¬†INTERFACES intf1.
¬†¬†METHODS meth2.
ENDINTERFACE.
CLASS cls DEFINITION ABSTRACT.
¬†¬†PUBLIC SECTION.
¬†¬†¬†¬†INTERFACES intf2 ABSTRACT METHODS intf1~meth1 meth2.
ENDCLASS.

Addition 3

... ALL METHODS *{*ABSTRACT*|*FINAL*}*

Effect

Instead of making individual interface methods in the class abstract or final it is possible, using the addition ALL METHODS *{*ABSTRACT*|*FINAL*}*, to make all interface methods either [abstract](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods_abstract_final.htm) or [final](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods_abstract_final.htm).

Example

Implementation of an interface intf in an abstract class cls1, in which all methods are made abstract and must be implemented in a subclass cls2.

INTERFACE intf.
¬†¬†METHODS:
¬†¬†¬†¬†meth1,
¬†¬†¬†¬†meth2.
¬†¬†...
ENDINTERFACE.
CLASS cls1 DEFINITION ABSTRACT.
¬†¬†PUBLIC SECTION.
¬†¬†¬†¬†INTERFACES intf ALL METHODS ABSTRACT.
¬†¬†¬†¬†ALIASES:
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†meth1 FOR intf~meth1,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†meth2 FOR intf~meth2.
ENDCLASS.
CLASS cls2 DEFINITION INHERITING FROM cls1.
¬†¬†PUBLIC SECTION.
¬†¬†¬†¬†METHODS:
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†meth1 REDEFINITION,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†meth2 REDEFINITION.
ENDCLASS.
CLASS cls2 IMPLEMENTATION.
¬†¬†METHOD meth1.
¬†¬†¬†¬†...
¬†¬†ENDMETHOD.
¬†¬†METHOD meth2.
¬†¬†¬†¬†...
¬†¬†ENDMETHOD.
ENDCLASS.

Addition 4

... DATA VALUES attr1 = val1 attr2 = val2 ...

Effect

Using the addition DATA VALUES, initial values can be assigned to individual attributes attr. For attributes, this addition fulfills the same functions as the addition VALUE of the statement [DATA](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapdata.htm) for attributes in its own class.

The following can be specified as attributes attr1, attr2, ...

-   Attributes that are declared in the interface intf itself.

-   Alias names declared in the interface intf for attributes declared in interfaces that are included in intf.

-   Attributes that are declared in interfaces included in intf using the name of its own interface and the interface component selector (~). In this case the component interface cannot itself be included with the statement INTERFACES.

Constants declared in the interface or in a component interface with the statement [CONSTANTS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapconstants.htm) cannot be specified after the addition DATA VALUES.

Example

Implementation of an interface intf in a class cls, where the interface attributes are assigned start values.

INTERFACE intf.
¬†¬†CLASS-DATA:
¬†¬†¬†¬†attr1 TYPE string,
¬†¬†¬†¬†attr2 TYPE string.
¬†¬†...
ENDINTERFACE.
CLASS cls DEFINITION ABSTRACT.
¬†¬†PUBLIC SECTION.
¬†¬†¬†¬†INTERFACES intf

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†attr2 = 'World'.
¬†¬†¬†¬†ALIASES:
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†attr1 FOR intf~attr1,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†attr2 FOR intf~attr2.
ENDCLASS.
START-OF-SELECTION.

INTERFACES, composition

[Short Reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapinterfaces_shortref.htm)

Syntax

INTERFACES intf.

Effect

In the declaration of an interface, the statement INTERFACES includes the interface intf in the declared interface. Additions cannot be specified. As a result, the interface intf becomes a component interface of a composite interface.

An interface can be composed of any number of different component interfaces. All component interfaces are equal and on one level. If a component interface itself is a composite, that is, it contains its own component interfaces, the nesting hierarchy is irrelevant for the composition of the interface. It is relevant, however, for accessing the interface components.

To access the component comp of a component interface intf within a composite interface, the expression intf~comp can be used with the interface component selector (~). It is not possible to use the interface component selector multiple times in a name (intf1~intf2~comp). In a composite interface, it is possible to use the interface component selector to access only those interface components of the component interface that are included in this interface using the statement INTERFACES. Since all nested interfaces are at the same level, however, this is sufficient to access the interface components of all component interfaces using the name of their interface.

Hints

-   Each interface and its components appear only once in a composite interface. Even an interface that is seemingly implemented more than once in an interface, because it is an interface component of one or more other interfaces, really exists only once.

-   Since there are no separate namespaces for global and local interfaces, it must be ensured that combinations of local interfaces do not result in combinations of global and local interfaces with identical names, because they cannot be equal and on the same level in their implementation.
    

Example

The following example shows how the statement INTERFACES can be used to compose and implement interfaces. Class c1 implements the composite interfaces i2 and i3. Although i1 is a component interface of i2 and i3, it exists only once in class c1. A reference variable iref1 of the static type i1 creates an object class c1 and calls the method i1~m1, which is implemented there.

ALIASES

[Short Reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapaliases_shortref.htm)

Syntax

ALIASES alias FOR intf~comp.

Effect

In the declaration part of a class or interface, this statement declares an alias name alias for a component comp of the interface intf. The [naming conventions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abennaming_conventions.htm) apply to the name alias. The interface intf must be implemented in the same class or included in the same interface. The alias name can be used anywhere, where it is visible, instead of intf~comp, to access the interface component comp.

An alias name is a component of the class and the interface. It is in the same namespace as the other components and is inherited by subclasses. In classes, an alias name can be declared in every [visibility section](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenvisibility_section_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Hints

-   Within a context, such as a class declaration or method, only one name should be used to access components. The syntax check issues a warning if both the alias name and the full name intf~meth are used together.

-   When implementing interface methods in the implementation part of classes using METHOD and when [re-defining](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenredefinition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") methods using METHODS ... REDEFINITION, the alias name can also be used.
    

Example

In the interfaces i2, i3 and the class c1, aliases are declared for the methods of the included or implemented interfaces. In the implementation part of the class, the interface methods in the [METHODS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods.htm) statements are implemented using the interface component selector. However ,the aliases of the classes could also be used here.

INTERFACE i1.
¬†¬†METHODS meth.
ENDINTERFACE.
INTERFACE i2.
¬†¬†INTERFACES i1.
¬†¬†ALIASES m1 FOR i1~meth.
¬†¬†METHODS meth.

¬†¬†INTERFACES i2.
¬†¬†ALIASES: m1 FOR i2~m1,

Effect

In the [public](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenpublic_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [visibility section](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenvisibility_section_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of a class, the statement INTERFACES implements the interface intf in the class. Additions can also be specified to determine the properties of interface components in the class.

All local or global interfaces that are visible here can be specified for intf that are not already included in a superclass of the current class. The components of the interfaces become public components of the class after the implementation. An interface component called comp has the name intf~comp in the class, where intf is the name of the interface and the character ~ is the interface component selector. A class must implement all methods of the interface in its implementation part, with the following exceptions:

-   Interface methods declared as optional using the addition [DEFAULT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods_default.htm).

-   Interface methods that are specified in the class after the addition ABSTRACT METHODS and are therefore declared as abstract.

-   Partial implementations are allowed in test classes using the addition [PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapinterfaces_partially.htm).

Hints

-   A class can implement any number of different interfaces. All of the interfaces implemented by a class are equal and on the same level. If an interface intf implemented in a class is a composite, that is, it contains component interfaces, these are implemented in the class like individual interfaces, regardless of their nesting hierarchy, and their components are addressed using the name of their component interface instead of using the name intf. It is generally not possible to use the interface component selector multiple times in a name (intf1~intf2~comp).
    

-   Each interface appears only once in a class and every interface component comp is always clearly accessible using the intf~comp. Even the components of an interface, which is the interface component of one or more other interface, and appears to be implemented multiple times in a class, only exist once.
    

-   If the implementation of a non-optional method of a global interface implemented using INTERFACES is missing in a class, a syntax warning occurs instead of a syntax error. This prevents classes from becoming unusable due to subsequent enhancements of global interfaces. Calling a missing implementation, however, always raises an exception of the class CX\_SY\_DYN\_CALL\_ILLEGAL\_METHOD and, if not handled, produces the runtime error CALL\_METHOD\_NOT\_IMPLEMENTED. A real syntax error is produced when local interfaces are used, and the implementation is missing.
    

-   If a class implements a method intf~... of a global interface intf implemented using INTERFACES in its implementation part and the method is not declared in the interface, a warning is raised by the syntax check. This type of method implementation is dead code that cannot be executed and should removed. Classes become unusable in the case of a syntax error if methods were later deleted from an implemented global interface, and which were implemented without a role in a class and had no values. An actual syntax error occurs when local interfaces are used.

Using the additions ABSTRACT METHODS and FINAL METHODS, the individual instance methods meth of the interface can be made either abstract or final in the class to be implemented. The same rules apply as to the additions [ABSTRACT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods_abstract_final.htm) and [FINAL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods_abstract_final.htm) of the statement [METHODS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods.htm). In particular, the whole class must be abstract if an interface method is made abstract and at the same time no interface method can be listed after ABSTRACT METHODS and FINAL METHODS.

The following can be specified as methods meth1, meth2, ...

-   Instance methods that are declared in the interface intf itself.

-   Alias names declared in the interface intf for instance methods declared in interfaces that are included in intf.

-   Instance methods that are declared in interfaces bound in intf using the name of its own interface and the interface component selector (~). In this case the component interface cannot itself be included with the statement INTERFACES.

If an interface is included using multiple INTERFACES statements, the specifications in the additions FINAL and ABSTRACT must not produce contradictory definitions for a method.

Example

Definition of abstract methods when including two interfaces intf1 and intf2 in an abstract class cls.

INTERFACE intf1.
¬†¬†METHODS meth1.
ENDINTERFACE.
INTERFACE intf2.
¬†¬†INTERFACES intf1.
¬†¬†METHODS meth2.
ENDINTERFACE.
CLASS cls DEFINITION ABSTRACT.
¬†¬†PUBLIC SECTION.
¬†¬†¬†¬†INTERFACES intf1 ABSTRACT METHODS meth1.
¬†¬†¬†¬†INTERFACES intf2 ABSTRACT METHODS meth2.
ENDCLASS.

Example

Short form of the preceding example. Since intf2 includes the interface intf1, its methods can be specified as intf1~meth1. This means that a separate statement INTERFACES intf1 is no longer possible in this class.

INTERFACE intf1.
¬†¬†METHODS meth1.
ENDINTERFACE.
INTERFACE intf2.
¬†¬†INTERFACES intf1.
¬†¬†METHODS meth2.
ENDINTERFACE.
CLASS cls DEFINITION ABSTRACT.
¬†¬†PUBLIC SECTION.
¬†¬†¬†¬†INTERFACES intf2 ABSTRACT METHODS intf1~meth1 meth2.
ENDCLASS.

Addition 3

... ALL METHODS *{*ABSTRACT*|*FINAL*}*

Effect

Instead of making individual interface methods in the class abstract or final it is possible, using the addition ALL METHODS *{*ABSTRACT*|*FINAL*}*, to make all interface methods either [abstract](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods_abstract_final.htm) or [final](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods_abstract_final.htm).

Example

Implementation of an interface intf in an abstract class cls1, in which all methods are made abstract and must be implemented in a subclass cls2.

INTERFACE intf.
¬†¬†METHODS:
¬†¬†¬†¬†meth1,
¬†¬†¬†¬†meth2.
¬†¬†...
ENDINTERFACE.
CLASS cls1 DEFINITION ABSTRACT.
¬†¬†PUBLIC SECTION.
¬†¬†¬†¬†INTERFACES intf ALL METHODS ABSTRACT.
¬†¬†¬†¬†ALIASES:
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†meth1 FOR intf~meth1,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†meth2 FOR intf~meth2.
ENDCLASS.
CLASS cls2 DEFINITION INHERITING FROM cls1.
¬†¬†PUBLIC SECTION.
¬†¬†¬†¬†METHODS:
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†meth1 REDEFINITION,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†meth2 REDEFINITION.
ENDCLASS.
CLASS cls2 IMPLEMENTATION.
¬†¬†METHOD meth1.
¬†¬†¬†¬†...
¬†¬†ENDMETHOD.
¬†¬†METHOD meth2.
¬†¬†¬†¬†...
¬†¬†ENDMETHOD.
ENDCLASS.

Addition 4

... DATA VALUES attr1 = val1 attr2 = val2 ...

Effect

Using the addition DATA VALUES, initial values can be assigned to individual attributes attr. For attributes, this addition fulfills the same functions as the addition VALUE of the statement [DATA](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapdata.htm) for attributes in its own class.

The following can be specified as attributes attr1, attr2, ...

-   Attributes that are declared in the interface intf itself.

-   Alias names declared in the interface intf for attributes declared in interfaces that are included in intf.

-   Attributes that are declared in interfaces included in intf using the name of its own interface and the interface component selector (~). In this case the component interface cannot itself be included with the statement INTERFACES.

Constants declared in the interface or in a component interface with the statement [CONSTANTS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapconstants.htm) cannot be specified after the addition DATA VALUES.

Example

Implementation of an interface intf in a class cls, where the interface attributes are assigned start values.

INTERFACE intf.
¬†¬†CLASS-DATA:
¬†¬†¬†¬†attr1 TYPE string,
¬†¬†¬†¬†attr2 TYPE string.
¬†¬†...
ENDINTERFACE.
CLASS cls DEFINITION ABSTRACT.
¬†¬†PUBLIC SECTION.
¬†¬†¬†¬†INTERFACES intf
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†DATA VALUES attr1 = 'Hello'
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†attr2 = 'World'.
¬†¬†¬†¬†ALIASES:
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†attr1 FOR intf~attr1,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†attr2 FOR intf~attr2.
ENDCLASS.
START-OF-SELECTION.
¬†¬†cl\_demo\_output=>display( |{ cls=>attr1 } { cls=>attr2 }| ).

INTERFACES, composition

[Short Reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapinterfaces_shortref.htm)

Syntax

INTERFACES intf.

Effect

In the declaration of an interface, the statement INTERFACES includes the interface intf in the declared interface. Additions cannot be specified. As a result, the interface intf becomes a component interface of a composite interface.

An interface can be composed of any number of different component interfaces. All component interfaces are equal and on one level. If a component interface itself is a composite, that is, it contains its own component interfaces, the nesting hierarchy is irrelevant for the composition of the interface. It is relevant, however, for accessing the interface components.

To access the component comp of a component interface intf within a composite interface, the expression intf~comp can be used with the interface component selector (~). It is not possible to use the interface component selector multiple times in a name (intf1~intf2~comp). In a composite interface, it is possible to use the interface component selector to access only those interface components of the component interface that are included in this interface using the statement INTERFACES. Since all nested interfaces are at the same level, however, this is sufficient to access the interface components of all component interfaces using the name of their interface.

Hints

-   Each interface and its components appear only once in a composite interface. Even an interface that is seemingly implemented more than once in an interface, because it is an interface component of one or more other interfaces, really exists only once.

-   Since there are no separate namespaces for global and local interfaces, it must be ensured that combinations of local interfaces do not result in combinations of global and local interfaces with identical names, because they cannot be equal and on the same level in their implementation.
    

Example

The following example shows how the statement INTERFACES can be used to compose and implement interfaces. Class c1 implements the composite interfaces i2 and i3. Although i1 is a component interface of i2 and i3, it exists only once in class c1. A reference variable iref1 of the static type i1 creates an object class c1 and calls the method i1~m1, which is implemented there.

INTERFACE i1.
¬†¬†METHODS m1.
ENDINTERFACE.
INTERFACE i2.
¬†¬†INTERFACES i1.
¬†¬†METHODS m2.
ENDINTERFACE.
INTERFACE i3.
¬†¬†INTERFACES i1.
¬†¬†METHODS m3.
ENDINTERFACE.
CLASS c1 DEFINITION.
¬†¬†PUBLIC SECTION.
¬†¬†¬†¬†INTERFACES: i2, i3.
ENDCLASS.

¬†¬†¬†¬†...
¬†¬†ENDMETHOD.
¬†¬†METHOD i2~m2.
¬†¬†¬†¬†...
¬†¬†ENDMETHOD.
¬†¬†METHOD i3~m3.
¬†¬†¬†¬†...
¬†¬†ENDMETHOD.

ALIASES

[Short Reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapaliases_shortref.htm)

Syntax

ALIASES alias FOR intf~comp.

Effect

In the declaration part of a class or interface, this statement declares an alias name alias for a component comp of the interface intf. The [naming conventions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abennaming_conventions.htm) apply to the name alias. The interface intf must be implemented in the same class or included in the same interface. The alias name can be used anywhere, where it is visible, instead of intf~comp, to access the interface component comp.

An alias name is a component of the class and the interface. It is in the same namespace as the other components and is inherited by subclasses. In classes, an alias name can be declared in every [visibility section](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenvisibility_section_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Hints

-   Within a context, such as a class declaration or method, only one name should be used to access components. The syntax check issues a warning if both the alias name and the full name intf~meth are used together.

-   When implementing interface methods in the implementation part of classes using METHOD and when [re-defining](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenredefinition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") methods using METHODS ... REDEFINITION, the alias name can also be used.
    

Example

In the interfaces i2, i3 and the class c1, aliases are declared for the methods of the included or implemented interfaces. In the implementation part of the class, the interface methods in the [METHODS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods.htm) statements are implemented using the interface component selector. However ,the aliases of the classes could also be used here.

INTERFACE i1.
¬†¬†METHODS meth.
ENDINTERFACE.
INTERFACE i2.
¬†¬†INTERFACES i1.
¬†¬†ALIASES m1 FOR i1~meth.
¬†¬†METHODS meth.

Effect

In the [public](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenpublic_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [visibility section](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenvisibility_section_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of a class, the statement INTERFACES implements the interface intf in the class. Additions can also be specified to determine the properties of interface components in the class.

All local or global interfaces that are visible here can be specified for intf that are not already included in a superclass of the current class. The components of the interfaces become public components of the class after the implementation. An interface component called comp has the name intf~comp in the class, where intf is the name of the interface and the character ~ is the interface component selector. A class must implement all methods of the interface in its implementation part, with the following exceptions:

-   Interface methods declared as optional using the addition [DEFAULT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods_default.htm).

-   Interface methods that are specified in the class after the addition ABSTRACT METHODS and are therefore declared as abstract.

-   Partial implementations are allowed in test classes using the addition [PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapinterfaces_partially.htm).

Hints

-   A class can implement any number of different interfaces. All of the interfaces implemented by a class are equal and on the same level. If an interface intf implemented in a class is a composite, that is, it contains component interfaces, these are implemented in the class like individual interfaces, regardless of their nesting hierarchy, and their components are addressed using the name of their component interface instead of using the name intf. It is generally not possible to use the interface component selector multiple times in a name (intf1~intf2~comp).
    

-   Each interface appears only once in a class and every interface component comp is always clearly accessible using the intf~comp. Even the components of an interface, which is the interface component of one or more other interface, and appears to be implemented multiple times in a class, only exist once.
    

-   If the implementation of a non-optional method of a global interface implemented using INTERFACES is missing in a class, a syntax warning occurs instead of a syntax error. This prevents classes from becoming unusable due to subsequent enhancements of global interfaces. Calling a missing implementation, however, always raises an exception of the class CX\_SY\_DYN\_CALL\_ILLEGAL\_METHOD and, if not handled, produces the runtime error CALL\_METHOD\_NOT\_IMPLEMENTED. A real syntax error is produced when local interfaces are used, and the implementation is missing.
    

-   If a class implements a method intf~... of a global interface intf implemented using INTERFACES in its implementation part and the method is not declared in the interface, a warning is raised by the syntax check. This type of method implementation is dead code that cannot be executed and should removed. Classes become unusable in the case of a syntax error if methods were later deleted from an implemented global interface, and which were implemented without a role in a class and had no values. An actual syntax error occurs when local interfaces are used.

Addition 1

... ABSTRACT METHODS meth1 meth2 ...

Addition 2

... FINAL METHODS meth1 meth2 ...

Effect

Using the additions ABSTRACT METHODS and FINAL METHODS, the individual instance methods meth of the interface can be made either abstract or final in the class to be implemented. The same rules apply as to the additions [ABSTRACT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods_abstract_final.htm) and [FINAL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods_abstract_final.htm) of the statement [METHODS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods.htm). In particular, the whole class must be abstract if an interface method is made abstract and at the same time no interface method can be listed after ABSTRACT METHODS and FINAL METHODS.

The following can be specified as methods meth1, meth2, ...

-   Instance methods that are declared in the interface intf itself.

-   Alias names declared in the interface intf for instance methods declared in interfaces that are included in intf.

-   Instance methods that are declared in interfaces bound in intf using the name of its own interface and the interface component selector (~). In this case the component interface cannot itself be included with the statement INTERFACES.

If an interface is included using multiple INTERFACES statements, the specifications in the additions FINAL and ABSTRACT must not produce contradictory definitions for a method.

Example

Definition of abstract methods when including two interfaces intf1 and intf2 in an abstract class cls.

INTERFACE intf1.
¬†¬†METHODS meth1.
ENDINTERFACE.
INTERFACE intf2.
¬†¬†INTERFACES intf1.
¬†¬†METHODS meth2.
ENDINTERFACE.
CLASS cls DEFINITION ABSTRACT.
¬†¬†PUBLIC SECTION.
¬†¬†¬†¬†INTERFACES intf1 ABSTRACT METHODS meth1.
¬†¬†¬†¬†INTERFACES intf2 ABSTRACT METHODS meth2.
ENDCLASS.

Example

Short form of the preceding example. Since intf2 includes the interface intf1, its methods can be specified as intf1~meth1. This means that a separate statement INTERFACES intf1 is no longer possible in this class.

INTERFACE intf1.
¬†¬†METHODS meth1.
ENDINTERFACE.
INTERFACE intf2.
¬†¬†INTERFACES intf1.
¬†¬†METHODS meth2.
ENDINTERFACE.
CLASS cls DEFINITION ABSTRACT.
¬†¬†PUBLIC SECTION.
¬†¬†¬†¬†INTERFACES intf2 ABSTRACT METHODS intf1~meth1 meth2.
ENDCLASS.

Addition 3

... ALL METHODS *{*ABSTRACT*|*FINAL*}*

Effect

Instead of making individual interface methods in the class abstract or final it is possible, using the addition ALL METHODS *{*ABSTRACT*|*FINAL*}*, to make all interface methods either [abstract](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods_abstract_final.htm) or [final](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods_abstract_final.htm).

Example

Implementation of an interface intf in an abstract class cls1, in which all methods are made abstract and must be implemented in a subclass cls2.

INTERFACE intf.
¬†¬†METHODS:
¬†¬†¬†¬†meth1,
¬†¬†¬†¬†meth2.
¬†¬†...
ENDINTERFACE.
CLASS cls1 DEFINITION ABSTRACT.
¬†¬†PUBLIC SECTION.
¬†¬†¬†¬†INTERFACES intf ALL METHODS ABSTRACT.
¬†¬†¬†¬†ALIASES:
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†meth1 FOR intf~meth1,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†meth2 FOR intf~meth2.
ENDCLASS.
CLASS cls2 DEFINITION INHERITING FROM cls1.
¬†¬†PUBLIC SECTION.
¬†¬†¬†¬†METHODS:
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†meth1 REDEFINITION,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†meth2 REDEFINITION.
ENDCLASS.
CLASS cls2 IMPLEMENTATION.
¬†¬†METHOD meth1.
¬†¬†¬†¬†...
¬†¬†ENDMETHOD.
¬†¬†METHOD meth2.
¬†¬†¬†¬†...
¬†¬†ENDMETHOD.
ENDCLASS.

Addition 4

... DATA VALUES attr1 = val1 attr2 = val2 ...

Effect

Using the addition DATA VALUES, initial values can be assigned to individual attributes attr. For attributes, this addition fulfills the same functions as the addition VALUE of the statement [DATA](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapdata.htm) for attributes in its own class.

The following can be specified as attributes attr1, attr2, ...

-   Attributes that are declared in the interface intf itself.

-   Alias names declared in the interface intf for attributes declared in interfaces that are included in intf.

-   Attributes that are declared in interfaces included in intf using the name of its own interface and the interface component selector (~). In this case the component interface cannot itself be included with the statement INTERFACES.

Constants declared in the interface or in a component interface with the statement [CONSTANTS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapconstants.htm) cannot be specified after the addition DATA VALUES.

Example

Implementation of an interface intf in a class cls, where the interface attributes are assigned start values.

INTERFACE intf.
¬†¬†CLASS-DATA:
¬†¬†¬†¬†attr1 TYPE string,
¬†¬†¬†¬†attr2 TYPE string.
¬†¬†...
ENDINTERFACE.

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†DATA VALUES attr1 = 'Hello'
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†attr2 = 'World'.
¬†¬†¬†¬†ALIASES:
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†attr1 FOR intf~attr1,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†attr2 FOR intf~attr2.
ENDCLASS.
START-OF-SELECTION.
¬†¬†cl\_demo\_output=>display( |{ cls=>attr1 } { cls=>attr2 }| ).

INTERFACES, composition

[Short Reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapinterfaces_shortref.htm)

Syntax

INTERFACES intf.

Effect

In the declaration of an interface, the statement INTERFACES includes the interface intf in the declared interface. Additions cannot be specified. As a result, the interface intf becomes a component interface of a composite interface.

An interface can be composed of any number of different component interfaces. All component interfaces are equal and on one level. If a component interface itself is a composite, that is, it contains its own component interfaces, the nesting hierarchy is irrelevant for the composition of the interface. It is relevant, however, for accessing the interface components.

To access the component comp of a component interface intf within a composite interface, the expression intf~comp can be used with the interface component selector (~). It is not possible to use the interface component selector multiple times in a name (intf1~intf2~comp). In a composite interface, it is possible to use the interface component selector to access only those interface components of the component interface that are included in this interface using the statement INTERFACES. Since all nested interfaces are at the same level, however, this is sufficient to access the interface components of all component interfaces using the name of their interface.

Hints

-   Each interface and its components appear only once in a composite interface. Even an interface that is seemingly implemented more than once in an interface, because it is an interface component of one or more other interfaces, really exists only once.

-   Since there are no separate namespaces for global and local interfaces, it must be ensured that combinations of local interfaces do not result in combinations of global and local interfaces with identical names, because they cannot be equal and on the same level in their implementation.
    

Example

The following example shows how the statement INTERFACES can be used to compose and implement interfaces. Class c1 implements the composite interfaces i2 and i3. Although i1 is a component interface of i2 and i3, it exists only once in class c1. A reference variable iref1 of the static type i1 creates an object class c1 and calls the method i1~m1, which is implemented there.

INTERFACE i1.
¬†¬†METHODS m1.
ENDINTERFACE.
INTERFACE i2.
¬†¬†INTERFACES i1.
¬†¬†METHODS m2.
ENDINTERFACE.
INTERFACE i3.
¬†¬†INTERFACES i1.
¬†¬†METHODS m3.

¬†¬†METHOD i2~m2.
¬†¬†¬†¬†...
¬†¬†ENDMETHOD.
¬†¬†METHOD i3~m3.
¬†¬†¬†¬†...
¬†¬†ENDMETHOD.

ALIASES

[Short Reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapaliases_shortref.htm)

Syntax

ALIASES alias FOR intf~comp.

Effect

In the declaration part of a class or interface, this statement declares an alias name alias for a component comp of the interface intf. The [naming conventions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abennaming_conventions.htm) apply to the name alias. The interface intf must be implemented in the same class or included in the same interface. The alias name can be used anywhere, where it is visible, instead of intf~comp, to access the interface component comp.

An alias name is a component of the class and the interface. It is in the same namespace as the other components and is inherited by subclasses. In classes, an alias name can be declared in every [visibility section](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenvisibility_section_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Hints

-   Within a context, such as a class declaration or method, only one name should be used to access components. The syntax check issues a warning if both the alias name and the full name intf~meth are used together.

-   When implementing interface methods in the implementation part of classes using METHOD and when [re-defining](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenredefinition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") methods using METHODS ... REDEFINITION, the alias name can also be used.
    

Example

In the interfaces i2, i3 and the class c1, aliases are declared for the methods of the included or implemented interfaces. In the implementation part of the class, the interface methods in the [METHODS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods.htm) statements are implemented using the interface component selector. However ,the aliases of the classes could also be used here.

¬†¬†INTERFACES i1.
¬†¬†ALIASES m1 FOR i1~meth.

Effect

In the [public](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenpublic_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [visibility section](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenvisibility_section_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of a class, the statement INTERFACES implements the interface intf in the class. Additions can also be specified to determine the properties of interface components in the class.

All local or global interfaces that are visible here can be specified for intf that are not already included in a superclass of the current class. The components of the interfaces become public components of the class after the implementation. An interface component called comp has the name intf~comp in the class, where intf is the name of the interface and the character ~ is the interface component selector. A class must implement all methods of the interface in its implementation part, with the following exceptions:

-   Interface methods declared as optional using the addition [DEFAULT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods_default.htm).

-   Interface methods that are specified in the class after the addition ABSTRACT METHODS and are therefore declared as abstract.

-   Partial implementations are allowed in test classes using the addition [PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapinterfaces_partially.htm).

Hints

-   A class can implement any number of different interfaces. All of the interfaces implemented by a class are equal and on the same level. If an interface intf implemented in a class is a composite, that is, it contains component interfaces, these are implemented in the class like individual interfaces, regardless of their nesting hierarchy, and their components are addressed using the name of their component interface instead of using the name intf. It is generally not possible to use the interface component selector multiple times in a name (intf1~intf2~comp).
    

-   Each interface appears only once in a class and every interface component comp is always clearly accessible using the intf~comp. Even the components of an interface, which is the interface component of one or more other interface, and appears to be implemented multiple times in a class, only exist once.
    

-   If the implementation of a non-optional method of a global interface implemented using INTERFACES is missing in a class, a syntax warning occurs instead of a syntax error. This prevents classes from becoming unusable due to subsequent enhancements of global interfaces. Calling a missing implementation, however, always raises an exception of the class CX\_SY\_DYN\_CALL\_ILLEGAL\_METHOD and, if not handled, produces the runtime error CALL\_METHOD\_NOT\_IMPLEMENTED. A real syntax error is produced when local interfaces are used, and the implementation is missing.
    

-   If a class implements a method intf~... of a global interface intf implemented using INTERFACES in its implementation part and the method is not declared in the interface, a warning is raised by the syntax check. This type of method implementation is dead code that cannot be executed and should removed. Classes become unusable in the case of a syntax error if methods were later deleted from an implemented global interface, and which were implemented without a role in a class and had no values. An actual syntax error occurs when local interfaces are used.

Addition 1

... ABSTRACT METHODS meth1 meth2 ...

Addition 2

... FINAL METHODS meth1 meth2 ...

Effect

Using the additions ABSTRACT METHODS and FINAL METHODS, the individual instance methods meth of the interface can be made either abstract or final in the class to be implemented. The same rules apply as to the additions [ABSTRACT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods_abstract_final.htm) and [FINAL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods_abstract_final.htm) of the statement [METHODS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods.htm). In particular, the whole class must be abstract if an interface method is made abstract and at the same time no interface method can be listed after ABSTRACT METHODS and FINAL METHODS.

The following can be specified as methods meth1, meth2, ...

-   Instance methods that are declared in the interface intf itself.

-   Alias names declared in the interface intf for instance methods declared in interfaces that are included in intf.

-   Instance methods that are declared in interfaces bound in intf using the name of its own interface and the interface component selector (~). In this case the component interface cannot itself be included with the statement INTERFACES.

If an interface is included using multiple INTERFACES statements, the specifications in the additions FINAL and ABSTRACT must not produce contradictory definitions for a method.

Example

Definition of abstract methods when including two interfaces intf1 and intf2 in an abstract class cls.

INTERFACE intf1.
¬†¬†METHODS meth1.
ENDINTERFACE.
INTERFACE intf2.
¬†¬†INTERFACES intf1.
¬†¬†METHODS meth2.
ENDINTERFACE.
CLASS cls DEFINITION ABSTRACT.
¬†¬†PUBLIC SECTION.
¬†¬†¬†¬†INTERFACES intf1 ABSTRACT METHODS meth1.
¬†¬†¬†¬†INTERFACES intf2 ABSTRACT METHODS meth2.
ENDCLASS.

Example

Short form of the preceding example. Since intf2 includes the interface intf1, its methods can be specified as intf1~meth1. This means that a separate statement INTERFACES intf1 is no longer possible in this class.

INTERFACE intf1.
¬†¬†METHODS meth1.
ENDINTERFACE.
INTERFACE intf2.
¬†¬†INTERFACES intf1.
¬†¬†METHODS meth2.
ENDINTERFACE.
CLASS cls DEFINITION ABSTRACT.
¬†¬†PUBLIC SECTION.
¬†¬†¬†¬†INTERFACES intf2 ABSTRACT METHODS intf1~meth1 meth2.
ENDCLASS.

Addition 3

... ALL METHODS *{*ABSTRACT*|*FINAL*}*

Effect

Instead of making individual interface methods in the class abstract or final it is possible, using the addition ALL METHODS *{*ABSTRACT*|*FINAL*}*, to make all interface methods either [abstract](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods_abstract_final.htm) or [final](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods_abstract_final.htm).

Example

Implementation of an interface intf in an abstract class cls1, in which all methods are made abstract and must be implemented in a subclass cls2.

INTERFACE intf.
¬†¬†METHODS:
¬†¬†¬†¬†meth1,
¬†¬†¬†¬†meth2.
¬†¬†...
ENDINTERFACE.
CLASS cls1 DEFINITION ABSTRACT.
¬†¬†PUBLIC SECTION.
¬†¬†¬†¬†INTERFACES intf ALL METHODS ABSTRACT.
¬†¬†¬†¬†ALIASES:
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†meth1 FOR intf~meth1,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†meth2 FOR intf~meth2.
ENDCLASS.
CLASS cls2 DEFINITION INHERITING FROM cls1.
¬†¬†PUBLIC SECTION.
¬†¬†¬†¬†METHODS:
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†meth1 REDEFINITION,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†meth2 REDEFINITION.
ENDCLASS.
CLASS cls2 IMPLEMENTATION.
¬†¬†METHOD meth1.
¬†¬†¬†¬†...
¬†¬†ENDMETHOD.
¬†¬†METHOD meth2.
¬†¬†¬†¬†...
¬†¬†ENDMETHOD.
ENDCLASS.

Addition 4

... DATA VALUES attr1 = val1 attr2 = val2 ...

Effect

Using the addition DATA VALUES, initial values can be assigned to individual attributes attr. For attributes, this addition fulfills the same functions as the addition VALUE of the statement [DATA](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapdata.htm) for attributes in its own class.

The following can be specified as attributes attr1, attr2, ...

-   Attributes that are declared in the interface intf itself.

-   Alias names declared in the interface intf for attributes declared in interfaces that are included in intf.

-   Attributes that are declared in interfaces included in intf using the name of its own interface and the interface component selector (~). In this case the component interface cannot itself be included with the statement INTERFACES.

Constants declared in the interface or in a component interface with the statement [CONSTANTS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapconstants.htm) cannot be specified after the addition DATA VALUES.

Example

Implementation of an interface intf in a class cls, where the interface attributes are assigned start values.

INTERFACE intf.
¬†¬†CLASS-DATA:
¬†¬†¬†¬†attr1 TYPE string,
¬†¬†¬†¬†attr2 TYPE string.
¬†¬†...
ENDINTERFACE.
CLASS cls DEFINITION ABSTRACT.
¬†¬†PUBLIC SECTION.
¬†¬†¬†¬†INTERFACES intf
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†DATA VALUES attr1 = 'Hello'
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†attr2 = 'World'.
¬†¬†¬†¬†ALIASES:
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†attr1 FOR intf~attr1,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†attr2 FOR intf~attr2.
ENDCLASS.
START-OF-SELECTION.
¬†¬†cl\_demo\_output=>display( |{ cls=>attr1 } { cls=>attr2 }| ).

INTERFACES, composition

[Short Reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapinterfaces_shortref.htm)

Syntax

INTERFACES intf.

Effect

In the declaration of an interface, the statement INTERFACES includes the interface intf in the declared interface. Additions cannot be specified. As a result, the interface intf becomes a component interface of a composite interface.

An interface can be composed of any number of different component interfaces. All component interfaces are equal and on one level. If a component interface itself is a composite, that is, it contains its own component interfaces, the nesting hierarchy is irrelevant for the composition of the interface. It is relevant, however, for accessing the interface components.

To access the component comp of a component interface intf within a composite interface, the expression intf~comp can be used with the interface component selector (~). It is not possible to use the interface component selector multiple times in a name (intf1~intf2~comp). In a composite interface, it is possible to use the interface component selector to access only those interface components of the component interface that are included in this interface using the statement INTERFACES. Since all nested interfaces are at the same level, however, this is sufficient to access the interface components of all component interfaces using the name of their interface.

Hints

-   Each interface and its components appear only once in a composite interface. Even an interface that is seemingly implemented more than once in an interface, because it is an interface component of one or more other interfaces, really exists only once.

-   Since there are no separate namespaces for global and local interfaces, it must be ensured that combinations of local interfaces do not result in combinations of global and local interfaces with identical names, because they cannot be equal and on the same level in their implementation.
    

Example

The following example shows how the statement INTERFACES can be used to compose and implement interfaces. Class c1 implements the composite interfaces i2 and i3. Although i1 is a component interface of i2 and i3, it exists only once in class c1. A reference variable iref1 of the static type i1 creates an object class c1 and calls the method i1~m1, which is implemented there.

INTERFACE i1.
¬†¬†METHODS m1.
ENDINTERFACE.
INTERFACE i2.
¬†¬†INTERFACES i1.
¬†¬†METHODS m2.
ENDINTERFACE.
INTERFACE i3.
¬†¬†INTERFACES i1.

ALIASES

[Short Reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapaliases_shortref.htm)

Syntax

ALIASES alias FOR intf~comp.

Effect

In the declaration part of a class or interface, this statement declares an alias name alias for a component comp of the interface intf. The [naming conventions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abennaming_conventions.htm) apply to the name alias. The interface intf must be implemented in the same class or included in the same interface. The alias name can be used anywhere, where it is visible, instead of intf~comp, to access the interface component comp.

An alias name is a component of the class and the interface. It is in the same namespace as the other components and is inherited by subclasses. In classes, an alias name can be declared in every [visibility section](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenvisibility_section_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Hints

-   Within a context, such as a class declaration or method, only one name should be used to access components. The syntax check issues a warning if both the alias name and the full name intf~meth are used together.

-   When implementing interface methods in the implementation part of classes using METHOD and when [re-defining](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenredefinition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") methods using METHODS ... REDEFINITION, the alias name can also be used.
    

Example

In the interfaces i2, i3 and the class c1, aliases are declared for the methods of the included or implemented interfaces. In the implementation part of the class, the interface methods in the [METHODS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods.htm) statements are implemented using the interface component selector. However ,the aliases of the classes could also be used here.

¬†¬†INTERFACES i1.
¬†¬†ALIASES m1 FOR i1~meth.

Effect

In the [public](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenpublic_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [visibility section](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenvisibility_section_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of a class, the statement INTERFACES implements the interface intf in the class. Additions can also be specified to determine the properties of interface components in the class.

All local or global interfaces that are visible here can be specified for intf that are not already included in a superclass of the current class. The components of the interfaces become public components of the class after the implementation. An interface component called comp has the name intf~comp in the class, where intf is the name of the interface and the character ~ is the interface component selector. A class must implement all methods of the interface in its implementation part, with the following exceptions:

-   Interface methods declared as optional using the addition [DEFAULT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods_default.htm).

-   Interface methods that are specified in the class after the addition ABSTRACT METHODS and are therefore declared as abstract.

-   Partial implementations are allowed in test classes using the addition [PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapinterfaces_partially.htm).

Hints

-   A class can implement any number of different interfaces. All of the interfaces implemented by a class are equal and on the same level. If an interface intf implemented in a class is a composite, that is, it contains component interfaces, these are implemented in the class like individual interfaces, regardless of their nesting hierarchy, and their components are addressed using the name of their component interface instead of using the name intf. It is generally not possible to use the interface component selector multiple times in a name (intf1~intf2~comp).
    

-   Each interface appears only once in a class and every interface component comp is always clearly accessible using the intf~comp. Even the components of an interface, which is the interface component of one or more other interface, and appears to be implemented multiple times in a class, only exist once.
    

-   If the implementation of a non-optional method of a global interface implemented using INTERFACES is missing in a class, a syntax warning occurs instead of a syntax error. This prevents classes from becoming unusable due to subsequent enhancements of global interfaces. Calling a missing implementation, however, always raises an exception of the class CX\_SY\_DYN\_CALL\_ILLEGAL\_METHOD and, if not handled, produces the runtime error CALL\_METHOD\_NOT\_IMPLEMENTED. A real syntax error is produced when local interfaces are used, and the implementation is missing.
    

-   If a class implements a method intf~... of a global interface intf implemented using INTERFACES in its implementation part and the method is not declared in the interface, a warning is raised by the syntax check. This type of method implementation is dead code that cannot be executed and should removed. Classes become unusable in the case of a syntax error if methods were later deleted from an implemented global interface, and which were implemented without a role in a class and had no values. An actual syntax error occurs when local interfaces are used.

Addition 1

... ABSTRACT METHODS meth1 meth2 ...

Addition 2

... FINAL METHODS meth1 meth2 ...

Effect

Using the additions ABSTRACT METHODS and FINAL METHODS, the individual instance methods meth of the interface can be made either abstract or final in the class to be implemented. The same rules apply as to the additions [ABSTRACT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods_abstract_final.htm) and [FINAL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods_abstract_final.htm) of the statement [METHODS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods.htm). In particular, the whole class must be abstract if an interface method is made abstract and at the same time no interface method can be listed after ABSTRACT METHODS and FINAL METHODS.

The following can be specified as methods meth1, meth2, ...

-   Instance methods that are declared in the interface intf itself.

-   Alias names declared in the interface intf for instance methods declared in interfaces that are included in intf.

-   Instance methods that are declared in interfaces bound in intf using the name of its own interface and the interface component selector (~). In this case the component interface cannot itself be included with the statement INTERFACES.

If an interface is included using multiple INTERFACES statements, the specifications in the additions FINAL and ABSTRACT must not produce contradictory definitions for a method.

Example

Definition of abstract methods when including two interfaces intf1 and intf2 in an abstract class cls.

INTERFACE intf1.
¬†¬†METHODS meth1.
ENDINTERFACE.
INTERFACE intf2.
¬†¬†INTERFACES intf1.
¬†¬†METHODS meth2.
ENDINTERFACE.
CLASS cls DEFINITION ABSTRACT.
¬†¬†PUBLIC SECTION.
¬†¬†¬†¬†INTERFACES intf1 ABSTRACT METHODS meth1.
¬†¬†¬†¬†INTERFACES intf2 ABSTRACT METHODS meth2.
ENDCLASS.

Example

Short form of the preceding example. Since intf2 includes the interface intf1, its methods can be specified as intf1~meth1. This means that a separate statement INTERFACES intf1 is no longer possible in this class.

INTERFACE intf1.
¬†¬†METHODS meth1.
ENDINTERFACE.
INTERFACE intf2.
¬†¬†INTERFACES intf1.
¬†¬†METHODS meth2.
ENDINTERFACE.
CLASS cls DEFINITION ABSTRACT.
¬†¬†PUBLIC SECTION.
¬†¬†¬†¬†INTERFACES intf2 ABSTRACT METHODS intf1~meth1 meth2.
ENDCLASS.

Addition 3

... ALL METHODS *{*ABSTRACT*|*FINAL*}*

Effect

Instead of making individual interface methods in the class abstract or final it is possible, using the addition ALL METHODS *{*ABSTRACT*|*FINAL*}*, to make all interface methods either [abstract](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods_abstract_final.htm) or [final](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods_abstract_final.htm).

Example

Implementation of an interface intf in an abstract class cls1, in which all methods are made abstract and must be implemented in a subclass cls2.

INTERFACE intf.
¬†¬†METHODS:
¬†¬†¬†¬†meth1,
¬†¬†¬†¬†meth2.
¬†¬†...
ENDINTERFACE.
CLASS cls1 DEFINITION ABSTRACT.
¬†¬†PUBLIC SECTION.
¬†¬†¬†¬†INTERFACES intf ALL METHODS ABSTRACT.
¬†¬†¬†¬†ALIASES:
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†meth1 FOR intf~meth1,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†meth2 FOR intf~meth2.
ENDCLASS.
CLASS cls2 DEFINITION INHERITING FROM cls1.
¬†¬†PUBLIC SECTION.
¬†¬†¬†¬†METHODS:
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†meth1 REDEFINITION,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†meth2 REDEFINITION.
ENDCLASS.
CLASS cls2 IMPLEMENTATION.
¬†¬†METHOD meth1.
¬†¬†¬†¬†...
¬†¬†ENDMETHOD.
¬†¬†METHOD meth2.
¬†¬†¬†¬†...
¬†¬†ENDMETHOD.
ENDCLASS.

Addition 4

... DATA VALUES attr1 = val1 attr2 = val2 ...

Effect

Using the addition DATA VALUES, initial values can be assigned to individual attributes attr. For attributes, this addition fulfills the same functions as the addition VALUE of the statement [DATA](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapdata.htm) for attributes in its own class.

The following can be specified as attributes attr1, attr2, ...

-   Attributes that are declared in the interface intf itself.

-   Alias names declared in the interface intf for attributes declared in interfaces that are included in intf.

-   Attributes that are declared in interfaces included in intf using the name of its own interface and the interface component selector (~). In this case the component interface cannot itself be included with the statement INTERFACES.

Constants declared in the interface or in a component interface with the statement [CONSTANTS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapconstants.htm) cannot be specified after the addition DATA VALUES.

Example

Implementation of an interface intf in a class cls, where the interface attributes are assigned start values.

INTERFACE intf.
¬†¬†CLASS-DATA:
¬†¬†¬†¬†attr1 TYPE string,
¬†¬†¬†¬†attr2 TYPE string.
¬†¬†...
ENDINTERFACE.
CLASS cls DEFINITION ABSTRACT.
¬†¬†PUBLIC SECTION.
¬†¬†¬†¬†INTERFACES intf

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†attr2 = 'World'.
¬†¬†¬†¬†ALIASES:
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†attr1 FOR intf~attr1,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†attr2 FOR intf~attr2.
ENDCLASS.
START-OF-SELECTION.
¬†¬†cl\_demo\_output=>display( |{ cls=>attr1 } { cls=>attr2 }| ).

INTERFACES, composition

[Short Reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapinterfaces_shortref.htm)

Syntax

INTERFACES intf.

Effect

In the declaration of an interface, the statement INTERFACES includes the interface intf in the declared interface. Additions cannot be specified. As a result, the interface intf becomes a component interface of a composite interface.

An interface can be composed of any number of different component interfaces. All component interfaces are equal and on one level. If a component interface itself is a composite, that is, it contains its own component interfaces, the nesting hierarchy is irrelevant for the composition of the interface. It is relevant, however, for accessing the interface components.

To access the component comp of a component interface intf within a composite interface, the expression intf~comp can be used with the interface component selector (~). It is not possible to use the interface component selector multiple times in a name (intf1~intf2~comp). In a composite interface, it is possible to use the interface component selector to access only those interface components of the component interface that are included in this interface using the statement INTERFACES. Since all nested interfaces are at the same level, however, this is sufficient to access the interface components of all component interfaces using the name of their interface.

Hints

-   Each interface and its components appear only once in a composite interface. Even an interface that is seemingly implemented more than once in an interface, because it is an interface component of one or more other interfaces, really exists only once.

-   Since there are no separate namespaces for global and local interfaces, it must be ensured that combinations of local interfaces do not result in combinations of global and local interfaces with identical names, because they cannot be equal and on the same level in their implementation.
    

Example

The following example shows how the statement INTERFACES can be used to compose and implement interfaces. Class c1 implements the composite interfaces i2 and i3. Although i1 is a component interface of i2 and i3, it exists only once in class c1. A reference variable iref1 of the static type i1 creates an object class c1 and calls the method i1~m1, which is implemented there.

INTERFACE i1.

ALIASES

[Short Reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapaliases_shortref.htm)

Syntax

ALIASES alias FOR intf~comp.

Effect

In the declaration part of a class or interface, this statement declares an alias name alias for a component comp of the interface intf. The [naming conventions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abennaming_conventions.htm) apply to the name alias. The interface intf must be implemented in the same class or included in the same interface. The alias name can be used anywhere, where it is visible, instead of intf~comp, to access the interface component comp.

An alias name is a component of the class and the interface. It is in the same namespace as the other components and is inherited by subclasses. In classes, an alias name can be declared in every [visibility section](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenvisibility_section_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Hints

-   Within a context, such as a class declaration or method, only one name should be used to access components. The syntax check issues a warning if both the alias name and the full name intf~meth are used together.

-   When implementing interface methods in the implementation part of classes using METHOD and when [re-defining](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenredefinition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") methods using METHODS ... REDEFINITION, the alias name can also be used.
    

Example

In the interfaces i2, i3 and the class c1, aliases are declared for the methods of the included or implemented interfaces. In the implementation part of the class, the interface methods in the [METHODS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods.htm) statements are implemented using the interface component selector. However ,the aliases of the classes could also be used here.

INTERFACE i1.
¬†¬†METHODS meth.
ENDINTERFACE.
INTERFACE i2.
¬†¬†INTERFACES i1.
¬†¬†ALIASES m1 FOR i1~meth.
¬†¬†METHODS meth.
ENDINTERFACE.

¬†¬†INTERFACES i2.
¬†¬†ALIASES: m1 FOR i2~m1,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† m2 FOR i2~meth.

Effect

In the [public](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenpublic_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [visibility section](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenvisibility_section_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of a class, the statement INTERFACES implements the interface intf in the class. Additions can also be specified to determine the properties of interface components in the class.

All local or global interfaces that are visible here can be specified for intf that are not already included in a superclass of the current class. The components of the interfaces become public components of the class after the implementation. An interface component called comp has the name intf~comp in the class, where intf is the name of the interface and the character ~ is the interface component selector. A class must implement all methods of the interface in its implementation part, with the following exceptions:

-   Interface methods declared as optional using the addition [DEFAULT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods_default.htm).

-   Interface methods that are specified in the class after the addition ABSTRACT METHODS and are therefore declared as abstract.

-   Partial implementations are allowed in test classes using the addition [PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapinterfaces_partially.htm).

Hints

-   A class can implement any number of different interfaces. All of the interfaces implemented by a class are equal and on the same level. If an interface intf implemented in a class is a composite, that is, it contains component interfaces, these are implemented in the class like individual interfaces, regardless of their nesting hierarchy, and their components are addressed using the name of their component interface instead of using the name intf. It is generally not possible to use the interface component selector multiple times in a name (intf1~intf2~comp).
    

-   Each interface appears only once in a class and every interface component comp is always clearly accessible using the intf~comp. Even the components of an interface, which is the interface component of one or more other interface, and appears to be implemented multiple times in a class, only exist once.
    

-   If the implementation of a non-optional method of a global interface implemented using INTERFACES is missing in a class, a syntax warning occurs instead of a syntax error. This prevents classes from becoming unusable due to subsequent enhancements of global interfaces. Calling a missing implementation, however, always raises an exception of the class CX\_SY\_DYN\_CALL\_ILLEGAL\_METHOD and, if not handled, produces the runtime error CALL\_METHOD\_NOT\_IMPLEMENTED. A real syntax error is produced when local interfaces are used, and the implementation is missing.
    

-   If a class implements a method intf~... of a global interface intf implemented using INTERFACES in its implementation part and the method is not declared in the interface, a warning is raised by the syntax check. This type of method implementation is dead code that cannot be executed and should removed. Classes become unusable in the case of a syntax error if methods were later deleted from an implemented global interface, and which were implemented without a role in a class and had no values. An actual syntax error occurs when local interfaces are used.

Using the additions ABSTRACT METHODS and FINAL METHODS, the individual instance methods meth of the interface can be made either abstract or final in the class to be implemented. The same rules apply as to the additions [ABSTRACT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods_abstract_final.htm) and [FINAL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods_abstract_final.htm) of the statement [METHODS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods.htm). In particular, the whole class must be abstract if an interface method is made abstract and at the same time no interface method can be listed after ABSTRACT METHODS and FINAL METHODS.

The following can be specified as methods meth1, meth2, ...

-   Instance methods that are declared in the interface intf itself.

-   Alias names declared in the interface intf for instance methods declared in interfaces that are included in intf.

-   Instance methods that are declared in interfaces bound in intf using the name of its own interface and the interface component selector (~). In this case the component interface cannot itself be included with the statement INTERFACES.

If an interface is included using multiple INTERFACES statements, the specifications in the additions FINAL and ABSTRACT must not produce contradictory definitions for a method.

Example

Definition of abstract methods when including two interfaces intf1 and intf2 in an abstract class cls.

INTERFACE intf1.
¬†¬†METHODS meth1.
ENDINTERFACE.
INTERFACE intf2.
¬†¬†INTERFACES intf1.
¬†¬†METHODS meth2.
ENDINTERFACE.
CLASS cls DEFINITION ABSTRACT.
¬†¬†PUBLIC SECTION.
¬†¬†¬†¬†INTERFACES intf1 ABSTRACT METHODS meth1.
¬†¬†¬†¬†INTERFACES intf2 ABSTRACT METHODS meth2.
ENDCLASS.

Example

Short form of the preceding example. Since intf2 includes the interface intf1, its methods can be specified as intf1~meth1. This means that a separate statement INTERFACES intf1 is no longer possible in this class.

INTERFACE intf1.
¬†¬†METHODS meth1.
ENDINTERFACE.
INTERFACE intf2.
¬†¬†INTERFACES intf1.
¬†¬†METHODS meth2.
ENDINTERFACE.
CLASS cls DEFINITION ABSTRACT.
¬†¬†PUBLIC SECTION.
¬†¬†¬†¬†INTERFACES intf2 ABSTRACT METHODS intf1~meth1 meth2.
ENDCLASS.

Addition 3

... ALL METHODS *{*ABSTRACT*|*FINAL*}*

Effect

Instead of making individual interface methods in the class abstract or final it is possible, using the addition ALL METHODS *{*ABSTRACT*|*FINAL*}*, to make all interface methods either [abstract](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods_abstract_final.htm) or [final](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods_abstract_final.htm).

Example

Implementation of an interface intf in an abstract class cls1, in which all methods are made abstract and must be implemented in a subclass cls2.

INTERFACE intf.
¬†¬†METHODS:
¬†¬†¬†¬†meth1,
¬†¬†¬†¬†meth2.
¬†¬†...
ENDINTERFACE.
CLASS cls1 DEFINITION ABSTRACT.
¬†¬†PUBLIC SECTION.
¬†¬†¬†¬†INTERFACES intf ALL METHODS ABSTRACT.
¬†¬†¬†¬†ALIASES:
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†meth1 FOR intf~meth1,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†meth2 FOR intf~meth2.
ENDCLASS.
CLASS cls2 DEFINITION INHERITING FROM cls1.
¬†¬†PUBLIC SECTION.
¬†¬†¬†¬†METHODS:
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†meth1 REDEFINITION,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†meth2 REDEFINITION.
ENDCLASS.
CLASS cls2 IMPLEMENTATION.
¬†¬†METHOD meth1.
¬†¬†¬†¬†...
¬†¬†ENDMETHOD.
¬†¬†METHOD meth2.
¬†¬†¬†¬†...
¬†¬†ENDMETHOD.
ENDCLASS.

Addition 4

... DATA VALUES attr1 = val1 attr2 = val2 ...

Effect

Using the addition DATA VALUES, initial values can be assigned to individual attributes attr. For attributes, this addition fulfills the same functions as the addition VALUE of the statement [DATA](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapdata.htm) for attributes in its own class.

The following can be specified as attributes attr1, attr2, ...

-   Attributes that are declared in the interface intf itself.

-   Alias names declared in the interface intf for attributes declared in interfaces that are included in intf.

-   Attributes that are declared in interfaces included in intf using the name of its own interface and the interface component selector (~). In this case the component interface cannot itself be included with the statement INTERFACES.

Constants declared in the interface or in a component interface with the statement [CONSTANTS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapconstants.htm) cannot be specified after the addition DATA VALUES.

Example

Implementation of an interface intf in a class cls, where the interface attributes are assigned start values.

INTERFACE intf.
¬†¬†CLASS-DATA:
¬†¬†¬†¬†attr1 TYPE string,
¬†¬†¬†¬†attr2 TYPE string.
¬†¬†...
ENDINTERFACE.
CLASS cls DEFINITION ABSTRACT.
¬†¬†PUBLIC SECTION.
¬†¬†¬†¬†INTERFACES intf
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†DATA VALUES attr1 = 'Hello'
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†attr2 = 'World'.
¬†¬†¬†¬†ALIASES:
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†attr1 FOR intf~attr1,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†attr2 FOR intf~attr2.
ENDCLASS.
START-OF-SELECTION.
¬†¬†cl\_demo\_output=>display( |{ cls=>attr1 } { cls=>attr2 }| ).

INTERFACES, composition

[Short Reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapinterfaces_shortref.htm)

Syntax

INTERFACES intf.

Effect

In the declaration of an interface, the statement INTERFACES includes the interface intf in the declared interface. Additions cannot be specified. As a result, the interface intf becomes a component interface of a composite interface.

An interface can be composed of any number of different component interfaces. All component interfaces are equal and on one level. If a component interface itself is a composite, that is, it contains its own component interfaces, the nesting hierarchy is irrelevant for the composition of the interface. It is relevant, however, for accessing the interface components.

To access the component comp of a component interface intf within a composite interface, the expression intf~comp can be used with the interface component selector (~). It is not possible to use the interface component selector multiple times in a name (intf1~intf2~comp). In a composite interface, it is possible to use the interface component selector to access only those interface components of the component interface that are included in this interface using the statement INTERFACES. Since all nested interfaces are at the same level, however, this is sufficient to access the interface components of all component interfaces using the name of their interface.

Hints

-   Each interface and its components appear only once in a composite interface. Even an interface that is seemingly implemented more than once in an interface, because it is an interface component of one or more other interfaces, really exists only once.

-   Since there are no separate namespaces for global and local interfaces, it must be ensured that combinations of local interfaces do not result in combinations of global and local interfaces with identical names, because they cannot be equal and on the same level in their implementation.
    

Example

The following example shows how the statement INTERFACES can be used to compose and implement interfaces. Class c1 implements the composite interfaces i2 and i3. Although i1 is a component interface of i2 and i3, it exists only once in class c1. A reference variable iref1 of the static type i1 creates an object class c1 and calls the method i1~m1, which is implemented there.

INTERFACE i1.
¬†¬†METHODS m1.
ENDINTERFACE.
INTERFACE i2.
¬†¬†INTERFACES i1.
¬†¬†METHODS m2.
ENDINTERFACE.
INTERFACE i3.
¬†¬†INTERFACES i1.
¬†¬†METHODS m3.
ENDINTERFACE.
CLASS c1 DEFINITION.
¬†¬†PUBLIC SECTION.
¬†¬†¬†¬†INTERFACES: i2, i3.
ENDCLASS.

¬†¬†¬†¬†...
¬†¬†ENDMETHOD.
¬†¬†METHOD i2~m2.
¬†¬†¬†¬†...
¬†¬†ENDMETHOD.
¬†¬†METHOD i3~m3.
¬†¬†¬†¬†...
¬†¬†ENDMETHOD.

ALIASES

[Short Reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapaliases_shortref.htm)

Syntax

ALIASES alias FOR intf~comp.

Effect

In the declaration part of a class or interface, this statement declares an alias name alias for a component comp of the interface intf. The [naming conventions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abennaming_conventions.htm) apply to the name alias. The interface intf must be implemented in the same class or included in the same interface. The alias name can be used anywhere, where it is visible, instead of intf~comp, to access the interface component comp.

An alias name is a component of the class and the interface. It is in the same namespace as the other components and is inherited by subclasses. In classes, an alias name can be declared in every [visibility section](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenvisibility_section_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Hints

-   Within a context, such as a class declaration or method, only one name should be used to access components. The syntax check issues a warning if both the alias name and the full name intf~meth are used together.

-   When implementing interface methods in the implementation part of classes using METHOD and when [re-defining](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenredefinition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") methods using METHODS ... REDEFINITION, the alias name can also be used.
    

Example

In the interfaces i2, i3 and the class c1, aliases are declared for the methods of the included or implemented interfaces. In the implementation part of the class, the interface methods in the [METHODS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods.htm) statements are implemented using the interface component selector. However ,the aliases of the classes could also be used here.

INTERFACE i1.
¬†¬†METHODS meth.
ENDINTERFACE.
INTERFACE i2.
¬†¬†INTERFACES i1.
¬†¬†ALIASES m1 FOR i1~meth.
¬†¬†METHODS meth.

Effect

In the [public](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenpublic_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [visibility section](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenvisibility_section_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of a class, the statement INTERFACES implements the interface intf in the class. Additions can also be specified to determine the properties of interface components in the class.

All local or global interfaces that are visible here can be specified for intf that are not already included in a superclass of the current class. The components of the interfaces become public components of the class after the implementation. An interface component called comp has the name intf~comp in the class, where intf is the name of the interface and the character ~ is the interface component selector. A class must implement all methods of the interface in its implementation part, with the following exceptions:

-   Interface methods declared as optional using the addition [DEFAULT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods_default.htm).

-   Interface methods that are specified in the class after the addition ABSTRACT METHODS and are therefore declared as abstract.

-   Partial implementations are allowed in test classes using the addition [PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapinterfaces_partially.htm).

Hints

-   A class can implement any number of different interfaces. All of the interfaces implemented by a class are equal and on the same level. If an interface intf implemented in a class is a composite, that is, it contains component interfaces, these are implemented in the class like individual interfaces, regardless of their nesting hierarchy, and their components are addressed using the name of their component interface instead of using the name intf. It is generally not possible to use the interface component selector multiple times in a name (intf1~intf2~comp).
    

-   Each interface appears only once in a class and every interface component comp is always clearly accessible using the intf~comp. Even the components of an interface, which is the interface component of one or more other interface, and appears to be implemented multiple times in a class, only exist once.
    

-   If the implementation of a non-optional method of a global interface implemented using INTERFACES is missing in a class, a syntax warning occurs instead of a syntax error. This prevents classes from becoming unusable due to subsequent enhancements of global interfaces. Calling a missing implementation, however, always raises an exception of the class CX\_SY\_DYN\_CALL\_ILLEGAL\_METHOD and, if not handled, produces the runtime error CALL\_METHOD\_NOT\_IMPLEMENTED. A real syntax error is produced when local interfaces are used, and the implementation is missing.
    

-   If a class implements a method intf~... of a global interface intf implemented using INTERFACES in its implementation part and the method is not declared in the interface, a warning is raised by the syntax check. This type of method implementation is dead code that cannot be executed and should removed. Classes become unusable in the case of a syntax error if methods were later deleted from an implemented global interface, and which were implemented without a role in a class and had no values. An actual syntax error occurs when local interfaces are used.

Addition 1

... ABSTRACT METHODS meth1 meth2 ...

Addition 2

... FINAL METHODS meth1 meth2 ...

Effect

Using the additions ABSTRACT METHODS and FINAL METHODS, the individual instance methods meth of the interface can be made either abstract or final in the class to be implemented. The same rules apply as to the additions [ABSTRACT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods_abstract_final.htm) and [FINAL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods_abstract_final.htm) of the statement [METHODS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods.htm). In particular, the whole class must be abstract if an interface method is made abstract and at the same time no interface method can be listed after ABSTRACT METHODS and FINAL METHODS.

The following can be specified as methods meth1, meth2, ...

-   Instance methods that are declared in the interface intf itself.

-   Alias names declared in the interface intf for instance methods declared in interfaces that are included in intf.

-   Instance methods that are declared in interfaces bound in intf using the name of its own interface and the interface component selector (~). In this case the component interface cannot itself be included with the statement INTERFACES.

If an interface is included using multiple INTERFACES statements, the specifications in the additions FINAL and ABSTRACT must not produce contradictory definitions for a method.

Example

Definition of abstract methods when including two interfaces intf1 and intf2 in an abstract class cls.

INTERFACE intf1.
¬†¬†METHODS meth1.
ENDINTERFACE.
INTERFACE intf2.
¬†¬†INTERFACES intf1.
¬†¬†METHODS meth2.
ENDINTERFACE.
CLASS cls DEFINITION ABSTRACT.
¬†¬†PUBLIC SECTION.
¬†¬†¬†¬†INTERFACES intf1 ABSTRACT METHODS meth1.
¬†¬†¬†¬†INTERFACES intf2 ABSTRACT METHODS meth2.
ENDCLASS.

Example

Short form of the preceding example. Since intf2 includes the interface intf1, its methods can be specified as intf1~meth1. This means that a separate statement INTERFACES intf1 is no longer possible in this class.

INTERFACE intf1.
¬†¬†METHODS meth1.
ENDINTERFACE.
INTERFACE intf2.
¬†¬†INTERFACES intf1.
¬†¬†METHODS meth2.
ENDINTERFACE.
CLASS cls DEFINITION ABSTRACT.
¬†¬†PUBLIC SECTION.
¬†¬†¬†¬†INTERFACES intf2 ABSTRACT METHODS intf1~meth1 meth2.
ENDCLASS.

Addition 3

... ALL METHODS *{*ABSTRACT*|*FINAL*}*

Effect

Instead of making individual interface methods in the class abstract or final it is possible, using the addition ALL METHODS *{*ABSTRACT*|*FINAL*}*, to make all interface methods either [abstract](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods_abstract_final.htm) or [final](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods_abstract_final.htm).

Example

Implementation of an interface intf in an abstract class cls1, in which all methods are made abstract and must be implemented in a subclass cls2.

INTERFACE intf.
¬†¬†METHODS:
¬†¬†¬†¬†meth1,
¬†¬†¬†¬†meth2.
¬†¬†...
ENDINTERFACE.
CLASS cls1 DEFINITION ABSTRACT.
¬†¬†PUBLIC SECTION.
¬†¬†¬†¬†INTERFACES intf ALL METHODS ABSTRACT.
¬†¬†¬†¬†ALIASES:
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†meth1 FOR intf~meth1,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†meth2 FOR intf~meth2.
ENDCLASS.
CLASS cls2 DEFINITION INHERITING FROM cls1.
¬†¬†PUBLIC SECTION.
¬†¬†¬†¬†METHODS:
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†meth1 REDEFINITION,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†meth2 REDEFINITION.
ENDCLASS.
CLASS cls2 IMPLEMENTATION.
¬†¬†METHOD meth1.
¬†¬†¬†¬†...
¬†¬†ENDMETHOD.
¬†¬†METHOD meth2.
¬†¬†¬†¬†...
¬†¬†ENDMETHOD.
ENDCLASS.

Addition 4

... DATA VALUES attr1 = val1 attr2 = val2 ...

Effect

Using the addition DATA VALUES, initial values can be assigned to individual attributes attr. For attributes, this addition fulfills the same functions as the addition VALUE of the statement [DATA](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapdata.htm) for attributes in its own class.

The following can be specified as attributes attr1, attr2, ...

-   Attributes that are declared in the interface intf itself.

-   Alias names declared in the interface intf for attributes declared in interfaces that are included in intf.

-   Attributes that are declared in interfaces included in intf using the name of its own interface and the interface component selector (~). In this case the component interface cannot itself be included with the statement INTERFACES.

Constants declared in the interface or in a component interface with the statement [CONSTANTS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapconstants.htm) cannot be specified after the addition DATA VALUES.

Example

Implementation of an interface intf in a class cls, where the interface attributes are assigned start values.

INTERFACE intf.
¬†¬†CLASS-DATA:
¬†¬†¬†¬†attr1 TYPE string,
¬†¬†¬†¬†attr2 TYPE string.
¬†¬†...
ENDINTERFACE.

¬†¬†¬†¬†INTERFACES intf
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†DATA VALUES attr1 = 'Hello'
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†attr2 = 'World'.
¬†¬†¬†¬†ALIASES:
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†attr1 FOR intf~attr1,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†attr2 FOR intf~attr2.
ENDCLASS.
START-OF-SELECTION.
¬†¬†cl\_demo\_output=>display( |{ cls=>attr1 } { cls=>attr2 }| ).

INTERFACES, composition

[Short Reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapinterfaces_shortref.htm)

Syntax

INTERFACES intf.

Effect

In the declaration of an interface, the statement INTERFACES includes the interface intf in the declared interface. Additions cannot be specified. As a result, the interface intf becomes a component interface of a composite interface.

An interface can be composed of any number of different component interfaces. All component interfaces are equal and on one level. If a component interface itself is a composite, that is, it contains its own component interfaces, the nesting hierarchy is irrelevant for the composition of the interface. It is relevant, however, for accessing the interface components.

To access the component comp of a component interface intf within a composite interface, the expression intf~comp can be used with the interface component selector (~). It is not possible to use the interface component selector multiple times in a name (intf1~intf2~comp). In a composite interface, it is possible to use the interface component selector to access only those interface components of the component interface that are included in this interface using the statement INTERFACES. Since all nested interfaces are at the same level, however, this is sufficient to access the interface components of all component interfaces using the name of their interface.

Hints

-   Each interface and its components appear only once in a composite interface. Even an interface that is seemingly implemented more than once in an interface, because it is an interface component of one or more other interfaces, really exists only once.

-   Since there are no separate namespaces for global and local interfaces, it must be ensured that combinations of local interfaces do not result in combinations of global and local interfaces with identical names, because they cannot be equal and on the same level in their implementation.
    

Example

The following example shows how the statement INTERFACES can be used to compose and implement interfaces. Class c1 implements the composite interfaces i2 and i3. Although i1 is a component interface of i2 and i3, it exists only once in class c1. A reference variable iref1 of the static type i1 creates an object class c1 and calls the method i1~m1, which is implemented there.

INTERFACE i1.
¬†¬†METHODS m1.
ENDINTERFACE.
INTERFACE i2.
¬†¬†INTERFACES i1.
¬†¬†METHODS m2.
ENDINTERFACE.
INTERFACE i3.
¬†¬†INTERFACES i1.

¬†¬†METHOD i3~m3.
¬†¬†¬†¬†...
¬†¬†ENDMETHOD.

ALIASES

[Short Reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapaliases_shortref.htm)

Syntax

ALIASES alias FOR intf~comp.

Effect

In the declaration part of a class or interface, this statement declares an alias name alias for a component comp of the interface intf. The [naming conventions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abennaming_conventions.htm) apply to the name alias. The interface intf must be implemented in the same class or included in the same interface. The alias name can be used anywhere, where it is visible, instead of intf~comp, to access the interface component comp.

An alias name is a component of the class and the interface. It is in the same namespace as the other components and is inherited by subclasses. In classes, an alias name can be declared in every [visibility section](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenvisibility_section_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Hints

-   Within a context, such as a class declaration or method, only one name should be used to access components. The syntax check issues a warning if both the alias name and the full name intf~meth are used together.

-   When implementing interface methods in the implementation part of classes using METHOD and when [re-defining](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenredefinition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") methods using METHODS ... REDEFINITION, the alias name can also be used.
    

Example

In the interfaces i2, i3 and the class c1, aliases are declared for the methods of the included or implemented interfaces. In the implementation part of the class, the interface methods in the [METHODS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods.htm) statements are implemented using the interface component selector. However ,the aliases of the classes could also be used here.

CREATE DATA, AREA HANDLE

[Short Reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcreate_data_shortref.htm)

Syntax

CREATE DATA dref AREA HANDLE handle ...

Effect

This statement creates an anonymous data object as a [shared object](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenshared_object_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in the [area instance version](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenarea_instance_version_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the [shared memory](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenshared_memory_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") to which the [area handle](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenarea_handle_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") referenced by handle is bound.

handle expects an object reference variable whose static type is [CL\_ABAP\_MEMORY\_AREA](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenshm_cl_abap_memory_area.htm) or one of its subclasses ([area class](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenarea_class_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")). When the statement is executed, handle must point to an [area handle](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenarea_handle_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and the area handle must be bound to an area instance version with a change lock. A reference like this can be created in one of the following ways:

-   By inheriting the return value of the methods [ATTACH\_FOR\_WRITE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenshm_area_class.htm) or [ATTACH\_FOR\_UPDATE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenshm_area_class.htm) of an area class created using transaction SHMA.
    

-   By inheriting the return value of the method [GET\_HANDLE\_BY\_...](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenshm_cl_abap_memory_area.htm) of any area class.
    

-   By inheriting the return value of the method [GET\_IMODE\_HANDLE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenshm_cl_imode_area.htm) of the predefined class CL\_IMODE\_AREA.

The latter is a reference to an area handle for the current [internal session](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeninternal_session_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and the statement CREATE DATA works in the same way as without the addition AREA HANDLE.

Restrictions

The creation of anonymous data objects as shared objects is subject to the following restrictions for data references in the shared objects memory: the storage of data references in closed [area instance versions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenarea_instance_version_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the shared objects memory is restricted to those [dynamic types](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendynamic_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that are known when loading a program into an internal session.

Therefore, the following data types cannot be used to create anonymous data objects in the shared object memory if these are to be preserved in a closed area instance version:

1.  All data types created in a temporary subroutine pool created using [GENERATE SUBROUTINE POOL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapgenerate_shortref.htm).
    
2.  Data types created dynamically at program runtime using methods of the [RTTC](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrun_time_type_creation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
    
3.  Bound data types of anonymous data objects created at program runtime, to which a dynamic length was assigned when they were created with CREATE DATA.
    
4.  Bound data types of anonymous data objects created at program runtime and that were assigned a dynamic type that requires a length specification when they were created using CREATE DATA.
    

Points 3 and 4 particularly include the statement CREATE DATA with the addition AREA HANDLE itself. Exceptions to the restrictions listed in points 2 to 4 are:

-   The restrictions do not apply to the data type p.

-   The restrictions do not apply to the data types c, n, and x, as long as the memory requirement does not exceed 100 bytes.

If a data reference variable that is stored in the shared objects memory refers to an anonymous data object of a dynamic type that is subject to the restrictions, the exception of the class CX\_SHM\_EXTERNAL\_TYPE is raised when the DETACH\_COMMIT method is executed.

The following can be used without restriction:

-   All visible data types of global interfaces and classes.

-   Data elements, DDIC structures, and DDIC database tables and DDIC table types of the ABAP Dictionary.

-   Data types from type pools.

-   Bound data types of anonymous data objects created at program runtime to which a static type with a static length was assigned when they were created using CREATE DATA.

-   Bound data types of anonymous data objects created at program runtime to which a fully specified dynamic type was assigned when they were created using CREATE DATA.

-   All data types that were created statically in the same program using declarative statements. It should be noted, however, that it is no longer possible to access existing area instances after each change to the creating program.

The additions [REF TO](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcreate_data_reference.htm) and [TABLE OF](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcreate_data_itab.htm) can be used as long as the specified types meet the above requirements. This also applies to the addition [HANDLE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcreate_data_handle.htm), which means the type description object must have been created with methods of the [RTTI](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrun_time_type_identific_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") from allowed types.

Hints

-   The only shared object that can be addressed from an ABAP program directly after an area instance version is bound is the instance of the [area root class](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenroot_data_class_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). All other objects must be referenced in this instance. In particular, no direct access to anonymous data objects is possible. Instead, the instance of the area root class must contain references to these anonymous data objects, which can also be indirect.

-   It is recommended that only global data types together with AREA HANDLE are used. As an occasional replacement for the direct reference to data elements and table types of the ABAP Dictionary, the respective types can be created in global interfaces, classes, or even type pools.
    

Example

Creation of an anonymous structure in an area instance version of area CL\_DEMO\_AREA.

DATA: root¬†¬† TYPE REF TO cl\_demo\_root,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†handle TYPE REF TO cl\_demo\_area.

Description

The addition AREA HANDLE is used to create an anonymous data object of type string as a [shared object](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenshared_object_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in an [area instance version](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenarea_instance_version_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the area CL\_DEMO\_AREA. The generically typed attribute dref of the [area root class](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenroot_data_class_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") CL\_DEMO\_ROOT is used to refer to a variable. A field symbol is used to dereference the data reference and assign a value to the anonymous data object.

After write access has been completed using DETACH\_COMMIT, a read is performed to demonstrate how the objects in the shared memory are accessed. Such accesses can also be made in another program, as long as the area instance version exists in the shared memory.

[Short Reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcreate_data_shortref.htm)

Syntax

CREATE DATA dref AREA HANDLE handle ...

Effect

This statement creates an anonymous data object as a [shared object](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenshared_object_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in the [area instance version](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenarea_instance_version_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the [shared memory](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenshared_memory_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") to which the [area handle](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenarea_handle_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") referenced by handle is bound.

handle expects an object reference variable whose static type is [CL\_ABAP\_MEMORY\_AREA](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenshm_cl_abap_memory_area.htm) or one of its subclasses ([area class](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenarea_class_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")). When the statement is executed, handle must point to an [area handle](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenarea_handle_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and the area handle must be bound to an area instance version with a change lock. A reference like this can be created in one of the following ways:

-   By inheriting the return value of the methods [ATTACH\_FOR\_WRITE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenshm_area_class.htm) or [ATTACH\_FOR\_UPDATE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenshm_area_class.htm) of an area class created using transaction SHMA.
    

-   By inheriting the return value of the method [GET\_HANDLE\_BY\_...](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenshm_cl_abap_memory_area.htm) of any area class.
    

-   By inheriting the return value of the method [GET\_IMODE\_HANDLE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenshm_cl_imode_area.htm) of the predefined class CL\_IMODE\_AREA.

The latter is a reference to an area handle for the current [internal session](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeninternal_session_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and the statement CREATE DATA works in the same way as without the addition AREA HANDLE.

Restrictions

The creation of anonymous data objects as shared objects is subject to the following restrictions for data references in the shared objects memory: the storage of data references in closed [area instance versions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenarea_instance_version_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the shared objects memory is restricted to those [dynamic types](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendynamic_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that are known when loading a program into an internal session.

Therefore, the following data types cannot be used to create anonymous data objects in the shared object memory if these are to be preserved in a closed area instance version:

1.  All data types created in a temporary subroutine pool created using [GENERATE SUBROUTINE POOL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapgenerate_shortref.htm).
    
2.  Data types created dynamically at program runtime using methods of the [RTTC](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrun_time_type_creation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
    
3.  Bound data types of anonymous data objects created at program runtime, to which a dynamic length was assigned when they were created with CREATE DATA.
    
4.  Bound data types of anonymous data objects created at program runtime and that were assigned a dynamic type that requires a length specification when they were created using CREATE DATA.
    

Points 3 and 4 particularly include the statement CREATE DATA with the addition AREA HANDLE itself. Exceptions to the restrictions listed in points 2 to 4 are:

-   The restrictions do not apply to the data type p.

-   The restrictions do not apply to the data types c, n, and x, as long as the memory requirement does not exceed 100 bytes.

If a data reference variable that is stored in the shared objects memory refers to an anonymous data object of a dynamic type that is subject to the restrictions, the exception of the class CX\_SHM\_EXTERNAL\_TYPE is raised when the DETACH\_COMMIT method is executed.

The following can be used without restriction:

-   All visible data types of global interfaces and classes.

-   Data elements, DDIC structures, and DDIC database tables and DDIC table types of the ABAP Dictionary.

-   Data types from type pools.

-   Bound data types of anonymous data objects created at program runtime to which a static type with a static length was assigned when they were created using CREATE DATA.

-   Bound data types of anonymous data objects created at program runtime to which a fully specified dynamic type was assigned when they were created using CREATE DATA.

-   All data types that were created statically in the same program using declarative statements. It should be noted, however, that it is no longer possible to access existing area instances after each change to the creating program.

The additions [REF TO](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcreate_data_reference.htm) and [TABLE OF](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcreate_data_itab.htm) can be used as long as the specified types meet the above requirements. This also applies to the addition [HANDLE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcreate_data_handle.htm), which means the type description object must have been created with methods of the [RTTI](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrun_time_type_identific_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") from allowed types.

Hints

-   The only shared object that can be addressed from an ABAP program directly after an area instance version is bound is the instance of the [area root class](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenroot_data_class_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). All other objects must be referenced in this instance. In particular, no direct access to anonymous data objects is possible. Instead, the instance of the area root class must contain references to these anonymous data objects, which can also be indirect.

-   It is recommended that only global data types together with AREA HANDLE are used. As an occasional replacement for the direct reference to data elements and table types of the ABAP Dictionary, the respective types can be created in global interfaces, classes, or even type pools.

Description

The addition AREA HANDLE is used to create an anonymous data object of type string as a [shared object](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenshared_object_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in an [area instance version](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenarea_instance_version_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the area CL\_DEMO\_AREA. The generically typed attribute dref of the [area root class](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenroot_data_class_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") CL\_DEMO\_ROOT is used to refer to a variable. A field symbol is used to dereference the data reference and assign a value to the anonymous data object.

After write access has been completed using DETACH\_COMMIT, a read is performed to demonstrate how the objects in the shared memory are accessed. Such accesses can also be made in another program, as long as the area instance version exists in the shared memory.

CREATE DATA, AREA HANDLE

[Short Reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcreate_data_shortref.htm)

Syntax

CREATE DATA dref AREA HANDLE handle ...

Effect

This statement creates an anonymous data object as a [shared object](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenshared_object_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in the [area instance version](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenarea_instance_version_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the [shared memory](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenshared_memory_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") to which the [area handle](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenarea_handle_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") referenced by handle is bound.

handle expects an object reference variable whose static type is [CL\_ABAP\_MEMORY\_AREA](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenshm_cl_abap_memory_area.htm) or one of its subclasses ([area class](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenarea_class_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")). When the statement is executed, handle must point to an [area handle](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenarea_handle_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and the area handle must be bound to an area instance version with a change lock. A reference like this can be created in one of the following ways:

-   By inheriting the return value of the methods [ATTACH\_FOR\_WRITE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenshm_area_class.htm) or [ATTACH\_FOR\_UPDATE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenshm_area_class.htm) of an area class created using transaction SHMA.
    

-   By inheriting the return value of the method [GET\_HANDLE\_BY\_...](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenshm_cl_abap_memory_area.htm) of any area class.
    

-   By inheriting the return value of the method [GET\_IMODE\_HANDLE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenshm_cl_imode_area.htm) of the predefined class CL\_IMODE\_AREA.

The latter is a reference to an area handle for the current [internal session](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeninternal_session_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and the statement CREATE DATA works in the same way as without the addition AREA HANDLE.

Restrictions

The creation of anonymous data objects as shared objects is subject to the following restrictions for data references in the shared objects memory: the storage of data references in closed [area instance versions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenarea_instance_version_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the shared objects memory is restricted to those [dynamic types](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendynamic_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that are known when loading a program into an internal session.

Therefore, the following data types cannot be used to create anonymous data objects in the shared object memory if these are to be preserved in a closed area instance version:

1.  All data types created in a temporary subroutine pool created using [GENERATE SUBROUTINE POOL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapgenerate_shortref.htm).
    
2.  Data types created dynamically at program runtime using methods of the [RTTC](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrun_time_type_creation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
    
3.  Bound data types of anonymous data objects created at program runtime, to which a dynamic length was assigned when they were created with CREATE DATA.
    
4.  Bound data types of anonymous data objects created at program runtime and that were assigned a dynamic type that requires a length specification when they were created using CREATE DATA.
    

Points 3 and 4 particularly include the statement CREATE DATA with the addition AREA HANDLE itself. Exceptions to the restrictions listed in points 2 to 4 are:

-   The restrictions do not apply to the data type p.

-   The restrictions do not apply to the data types c, n, and x, as long as the memory requirement does not exceed 100 bytes.

If a data reference variable that is stored in the shared objects memory refers to an anonymous data object of a dynamic type that is subject to the restrictions, the exception of the class CX\_SHM\_EXTERNAL\_TYPE is raised when the DETACH\_COMMIT method is executed.

The following can be used without restriction:

-   All visible data types of global interfaces and classes.

-   Data elements, DDIC structures, and DDIC database tables and DDIC table types of the ABAP Dictionary.

-   Data types from type pools.

-   Bound data types of anonymous data objects created at program runtime to which a static type with a static length was assigned when they were created using CREATE DATA.

-   Bound data types of anonymous data objects created at program runtime to which a fully specified dynamic type was assigned when they were created using CREATE DATA.

-   All data types that were created statically in the same program using declarative statements. It should be noted, however, that it is no longer possible to access existing area instances after each change to the creating program.

The additions [REF TO](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcreate_data_reference.htm) and [TABLE OF](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcreate_data_itab.htm) can be used as long as the specified types meet the above requirements. This also applies to the addition [HANDLE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcreate_data_handle.htm), which means the type description object must have been created with methods of the [RTTI](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrun_time_type_identific_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") from allowed types.

Hints

-   The only shared object that can be addressed from an ABAP program directly after an area instance version is bound is the instance of the [area root class](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenroot_data_class_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). All other objects must be referenced in this instance. In particular, no direct access to anonymous data objects is possible. Instead, the instance of the area root class must contain references to these anonymous data objects, which can also be indirect.

-   It is recommended that only global data types together with AREA HANDLE are used. As an occasional replacement for the direct reference to data elements and table types of the ABAP Dictionary, the respective types can be created in global interfaces, classes, or even type pools.
    

Example

Creation of an anonymous structure in an area instance version of area CL\_DEMO\_AREA.

DATA: root¬†¬† TYPE REF TO cl\_demo\_root,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†handle TYPE REF TO cl\_demo\_area.

Effect

This statement creates an anonymous data object as a [shared object](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenshared_object_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in the [area instance version](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenarea_instance_version_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the [shared memory](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenshared_memory_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") to which the [area handle](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenarea_handle_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") referenced by handle is bound.

When the statement is executed, handle must point to an [area handle](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenarea_handle_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and the area handle must be bound to an area instance version with a change lock. A reference like this can be created in one of the following ways:

-   By inheriting the return value of the methods [ATTACH\_FOR\_WRITE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenshm_area_class.htm) or [ATTACH\_FOR\_UPDATE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenshm_area_class.htm) of an area class created using transaction SHMA.
    

-   By inheriting the return value of the method [GET\_HANDLE\_BY\_...](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenshm_cl_abap_memory_area.htm) of any area class.

The latter is a reference to an area handle for the current [internal session](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeninternal_session_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and the statement CREATE DATA works in the same way as without the addition AREA HANDLE.

Restrictions

The creation of anonymous data objects as shared objects is subject to the following restrictions for data references in the shared objects memory: the storage of data references in closed [area instance versions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenarea_instance_version_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the shared objects memory is restricted to those [dynamic types](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendynamic_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that are known when loading a program into an internal session.

Therefore, the following data types cannot be used to create anonymous data objects in the shared object memory if these are to be preserved in a closed area instance version:

1.  All data types created in a temporary subroutine pool created using [GENERATE SUBROUTINE POOL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapgenerate_shortref.htm).
    
2.  Data types created dynamically at program runtime using methods of the [RTTC](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrun_time_type_creation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
    
3.  Bound data types of anonymous data objects created at program runtime, to which a dynamic length was assigned when they were created with CREATE DATA.
    
4.  Bound data types of anonymous data objects created at program runtime and that were assigned a dynamic type that requires a length specification when they were created using CREATE DATA.

-   The restrictions do not apply to the data type p.

-   The restrictions do not apply to the data types c, n, and x, as long as the memory requirement does not exceed 100 bytes.

If a data reference variable that is stored in the shared objects memory refers to an anonymous data object of a dynamic type that is subject to the restrictions, the exception of the class CX\_SHM\_EXTERNAL\_TYPE is raised when the DETACH\_COMMIT method is executed.

The following can be used without restriction:

-   All visible data types of global interfaces and classes.

-   Data elements, DDIC structures, and DDIC database tables and DDIC table types of the ABAP Dictionary.

-   Data types from type pools.

-   Bound data types of anonymous data objects created at program runtime to which a static type with a static length was assigned when they were created using CREATE DATA.

-   Bound data types of anonymous data objects created at program runtime to which a fully specified dynamic type was assigned when they were created using CREATE DATA.

-   All data types that were created statically in the same program using declarative statements. It should be noted, however, that it is no longer possible to access existing area instances after each change to the creating program.

The additions [REF TO](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcreate_data_reference.htm) and [TABLE OF](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcreate_data_itab.htm) can be used as long as the specified types meet the above requirements. This also applies to the addition [HANDLE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcreate_data_handle.htm), which means the type description object must have been created with methods of the [RTTI](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrun_time_type_identific_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") from allowed types.

-   The only shared object that can be addressed from an ABAP program directly after an area instance version is bound is the instance of the [area root class](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenroot_data_class_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). All other objects must be referenced in this instance. In particular, no direct access to anonymous data objects is possible. Instead, the instance of the area root class must contain references to these anonymous data objects, which can also be indirect.

-   It is recommended that only global data types together with AREA HANDLE are used. As an occasional replacement for the direct reference to data elements and table types of the ABAP Dictionary, the respective types can be created in global interfaces, classes, or even type pools.
    

Example

Creation of an anonymous structure in an area instance version of area CL\_DEMO\_AREA.

Description

The addition AREA HANDLE is used to create an anonymous data object of type string as a [shared object](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenshared_object_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in an [area instance version](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenarea_instance_version_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the area CL\_DEMO\_AREA. The generically typed attribute dref of the [area root class](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenroot_data_class_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") CL\_DEMO\_ROOT is used to refer to a variable. A field symbol is used to dereference the data reference and assign a value to the anonymous data object.

After write access has been completed using DETACH\_COMMIT, a read is performed to demonstrate how the objects in the shared memory are accessed. Such accesses can also be made in another program, as long as the area instance version exists in the shared memory.

CREATE DATA, AREA HANDLE

[Short Reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcreate_data_shortref.htm)

Syntax

CREATE DATA dref AREA HANDLE handle ...

Effect

This statement creates an anonymous data object as a [shared object](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenshared_object_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in the [area instance version](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenarea_instance_version_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the [shared memory](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenshared_memory_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") to which the [area handle](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenarea_handle_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") referenced by handle is bound.

handle expects an object reference variable whose static type is [CL\_ABAP\_MEMORY\_AREA](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenshm_cl_abap_memory_area.htm) or one of its subclasses ([area class](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenarea_class_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")). When the statement is executed, handle must point to an [area handle](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenarea_handle_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and the area handle must be bound to an area instance version with a change lock. A reference like this can be created in one of the following ways:

-   By inheriting the return value of the methods [ATTACH\_FOR\_WRITE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenshm_area_class.htm) or [ATTACH\_FOR\_UPDATE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenshm_area_class.htm) of an area class created using transaction SHMA.
    

-   By inheriting the return value of the method [GET\_HANDLE\_BY\_...](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenshm_cl_abap_memory_area.htm) of any area class.
    

-   By inheriting the return value of the method [GET\_IMODE\_HANDLE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenshm_cl_imode_area.htm) of the predefined class CL\_IMODE\_AREA.

The latter is a reference to an area handle for the current [internal session](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeninternal_session_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and the statement CREATE DATA works in the same way as without the addition AREA HANDLE.

Restrictions

The creation of anonymous data objects as shared objects is subject to the following restrictions for data references in the shared objects memory: the storage of data references in closed [area instance versions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenarea_instance_version_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the shared objects memory is restricted to those [dynamic types](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendynamic_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that are known when loading a program into an internal session.

Therefore, the following data types cannot be used to create anonymous data objects in the shared object memory if these are to be preserved in a closed area instance version:

1.  All data types created in a temporary subroutine pool created using [GENERATE SUBROUTINE POOL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapgenerate_shortref.htm).
    
2.  Data types created dynamically at program runtime using methods of the [RTTC](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrun_time_type_creation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
    
3.  Bound data types of anonymous data objects created at program runtime, to which a dynamic length was assigned when they were created with CREATE DATA.
    
4.  Bound data types of anonymous data objects created at program runtime and that were assigned a dynamic type that requires a length specification when they were created using CREATE DATA.
    

Points 3 and 4 particularly include the statement CREATE DATA with the addition AREA HANDLE itself. Exceptions to the restrictions listed in points 2 to 4 are:

-   The restrictions do not apply to the data type p.

-   The restrictions do not apply to the data types c, n, and x, as long as the memory requirement does not exceed 100 bytes.

If a data reference variable that is stored in the shared objects memory refers to an anonymous data object of a dynamic type that is subject to the restrictions, the exception of the class CX\_SHM\_EXTERNAL\_TYPE is raised when the DETACH\_COMMIT method is executed.

The following can be used without restriction:

-   All visible data types of global interfaces and classes.

-   Data elements, DDIC structures, and DDIC database tables and DDIC table types of the ABAP Dictionary.

-   Data types from type pools.

-   Bound data types of anonymous data objects created at program runtime to which a static type with a static length was assigned when they were created using CREATE DATA.

-   Bound data types of anonymous data objects created at program runtime to which a fully specified dynamic type was assigned when they were created using CREATE DATA.

-   All data types that were created statically in the same program using declarative statements. It should be noted, however, that it is no longer possible to access existing area instances after each change to the creating program.

The additions [REF TO](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcreate_data_reference.htm) and [TABLE OF](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcreate_data_itab.htm) can be used as long as the specified types meet the above requirements. This also applies to the addition [HANDLE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcreate_data_handle.htm), which means the type description object must have been created with methods of the [RTTI](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrun_time_type_identific_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") from allowed types.

Hints

-   The only shared object that can be addressed from an ABAP program directly after an area instance version is bound is the instance of the [area root class](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenroot_data_class_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). All other objects must be referenced in this instance. In particular, no direct access to anonymous data objects is possible. Instead, the instance of the area root class must contain references to these anonymous data objects, which can also be indirect.

-   It is recommended that only global data types together with AREA HANDLE are used. As an occasional replacement for the direct reference to data elements and table types of the ABAP Dictionary, the respective types can be created in global interfaces, classes, or even type pools.

When the statement is executed, handle must point to an [area handle](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenarea_handle_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and the area handle must be bound to an area instance version with a change lock. A reference like this can be created in one of the following ways:

-   By inheriting the return value of the methods [ATTACH\_FOR\_WRITE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenshm_area_class.htm) or [ATTACH\_FOR\_UPDATE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenshm_area_class.htm) of an area class created using transaction SHMA.
    

-   By inheriting the return value of the method [GET\_HANDLE\_BY\_...](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenshm_cl_abap_memory_area.htm) of any area class.
    

-   By inheriting the return value of the method [GET\_IMODE\_HANDLE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenshm_cl_imode_area.htm) of the predefined class CL\_IMODE\_AREA.

The latter is a reference to an area handle for the current [internal session](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeninternal_session_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and the statement CREATE DATA works in the same way as without the addition AREA HANDLE.

Restrictions

The creation of anonymous data objects as shared objects is subject to the following restrictions for data references in the shared objects memory: the storage of data references in closed [area instance versions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenarea_instance_version_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the shared objects memory is restricted to those [dynamic types](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendynamic_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that are known when loading a program into an internal session.

Therefore, the following data types cannot be used to create anonymous data objects in the shared object memory if these are to be preserved in a closed area instance version:

1.  All data types created in a temporary subroutine pool created using [GENERATE SUBROUTINE POOL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapgenerate_shortref.htm).
    
2.  Data types created dynamically at program runtime using methods of the [RTTC](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrun_time_type_creation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
    
3.  Bound data types of anonymous data objects created at program runtime, to which a dynamic length was assigned when they were created with CREATE DATA.
    
4.  Bound data types of anonymous data objects created at program runtime and that were assigned a dynamic type that requires a length specification when they were created using CREATE DATA.
    

Points 3 and 4 particularly include the statement CREATE DATA with the addition AREA HANDLE itself. Exceptions to the restrictions listed in points 2 to 4 are:

-   The restrictions do not apply to the data type p.

-   The restrictions do not apply to the data types c, n, and x, as long as the memory requirement does not exceed 100 bytes.

If a data reference variable that is stored in the shared objects memory refers to an anonymous data object of a dynamic type that is subject to the restrictions, the exception of the class CX\_SHM\_EXTERNAL\_TYPE is raised when the DETACH\_COMMIT method is executed.

The following can be used without restriction:

-   All visible data types of global interfaces and classes.

-   Data elements, DDIC structures, and DDIC database tables and DDIC table types of the ABAP Dictionary.

-   Data types from type pools.

-   Bound data types of anonymous data objects created at program runtime to which a static type with a static length was assigned when they were created using CREATE DATA.

-   Bound data types of anonymous data objects created at program runtime to which a fully specified dynamic type was assigned when they were created using CREATE DATA.

-   All data types that were created statically in the same program using declarative statements. It should be noted, however, that it is no longer possible to access existing area instances after each change to the creating program.

The additions [REF TO](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcreate_data_reference.htm) and [TABLE OF](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcreate_data_itab.htm) can be used as long as the specified types meet the above requirements. This also applies to the addition [HANDLE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcreate_data_handle.htm), which means the type description object must have been created with methods of the [RTTI](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrun_time_type_identific_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") from allowed types.

Hints

-   The only shared object that can be addressed from an ABAP program directly after an area instance version is bound is the instance of the [area root class](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenroot_data_class_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). All other objects must be referenced in this instance. In particular, no direct access to anonymous data objects is possible. Instead, the instance of the area root class must contain references to these anonymous data objects, which can also be indirect.

-   It is recommended that only global data types together with AREA HANDLE are used. As an occasional replacement for the direct reference to data elements and table types of the ABAP Dictionary, the respective types can be created in global interfaces, classes, or even type pools.
    

Example

Creation of an anonymous structure in an area instance version of area CL\_DEMO\_AREA.

DATA: root¬†¬† TYPE REF TO cl\_demo\_root,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†handle TYPE REF TO cl\_demo\_area.

Description

The addition AREA HANDLE is used to create an anonymous data object of type string as a [shared object](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenshared_object_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in an [area instance version](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenarea_instance_version_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the area CL\_DEMO\_AREA. The generically typed attribute dref of the [area root class](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenroot_data_class_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") CL\_DEMO\_ROOT is used to refer to a variable. A field symbol is used to dereference the data reference and assign a value to the anonymous data object.

After write access has been completed using DETACH\_COMMIT, a read is performed to demonstrate how the objects in the shared memory are accessed. Such accesses can also be made in another program, as long as the area instance version exists in the shared memory.

CREATE DATA, AREA HANDLE

[Short Reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcreate_data_shortref.htm)

Syntax

CREATE DATA dref AREA HANDLE handle ...

Effect

This statement creates an anonymous data object as a [shared object](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenshared_object_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in the [area instance version](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenarea_instance_version_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the [shared memory](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenshared_memory_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") to which the [area handle](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenarea_handle_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") referenced by handle is bound.

handle expects an object reference variable whose static type is [CL\_ABAP\_MEMORY\_AREA](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenshm_cl_abap_memory_area.htm) or one of its subclasses ([area class](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenarea_class_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")). When the statement is executed, handle must point to an [area handle](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenarea_handle_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and the area handle must be bound to an area instance version with a change lock. A reference like this can be created in one of the following ways:

-   By inheriting the return value of the methods [ATTACH\_FOR\_WRITE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenshm_area_class.htm) or [ATTACH\_FOR\_UPDATE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenshm_area_class.htm) of an area class created using transaction SHMA.
    

-   By inheriting the return value of the method [GET\_HANDLE\_BY\_...](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenshm_cl_abap_memory_area.htm) of any area class.
    

-   By inheriting the return value of the method [GET\_IMODE\_HANDLE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenshm_cl_imode_area.htm) of the predefined class CL\_IMODE\_AREA.

The latter is a reference to an area handle for the current [internal session](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeninternal_session_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and the statement CREATE DATA works in the same way as without the addition AREA HANDLE.

Restrictions

The creation of anonymous data objects as shared objects is subject to the following restrictions for data references in the shared objects memory: the storage of data references in closed [area instance versions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenarea_instance_version_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the shared objects memory is restricted to those [dynamic types](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendynamic_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that are known when loading a program into an internal session.

Therefore, the following data types cannot be used to create anonymous data objects in the shared object memory if these are to be preserved in a closed area instance version:

1.  All data types created in a temporary subroutine pool created using [GENERATE SUBROUTINE POOL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapgenerate_shortref.htm).
    
2.  Data types created dynamically at program runtime using methods of the [RTTC](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrun_time_type_creation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
    
3.  Bound data types of anonymous data objects created at program runtime, to which a dynamic length was assigned when they were created with CREATE DATA.
    
4.  Bound data types of anonymous data objects created at program runtime and that were assigned a dynamic type that requires a length specification when they were created using CREATE DATA.
    

Points 3 and 4 particularly include the statement CREATE DATA with the addition AREA HANDLE itself. Exceptions to the restrictions listed in points 2 to 4 are:

-   The restrictions do not apply to the data type p.

-   The restrictions do not apply to the data types c, n, and x, as long as the memory requirement does not exceed 100 bytes.

If a data reference variable that is stored in the shared objects memory refers to an anonymous data object of a dynamic type that is subject to the restrictions, the exception of the class CX\_SHM\_EXTERNAL\_TYPE is raised when the DETACH\_COMMIT method is executed.

The following can be used without restriction:

-   All visible data types of global interfaces and classes.

-   Data elements, DDIC structures, and DDIC database tables and DDIC table types of the ABAP Dictionary.

-   Data types from type pools.

-   Bound data types of anonymous data objects created at program runtime to which a static type with a static length was assigned when they were created using CREATE DATA.

-   Bound data types of anonymous data objects created at program runtime to which a fully specified dynamic type was assigned when they were created using CREATE DATA.

-   All data types that were created statically in the same program using declarative statements. It should be noted, however, that it is no longer possible to access existing area instances after each change to the creating program.

The additions [REF TO](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcreate_data_reference.htm) and [TABLE OF](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcreate_data_itab.htm) can be used as long as the specified types meet the above requirements. This also applies to the addition [HANDLE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcreate_data_handle.htm), which means the type description object must have been created with methods of the [RTTI](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrun_time_type_identific_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") from allowed types.

Hints

-   The only shared object that can be addressed from an ABAP program directly after an area instance version is bound is the instance of the [area root class](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenroot_data_class_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). All other objects must be referenced in this instance. In particular, no direct access to anonymous data objects is possible. Instead, the instance of the area root class must contain references to these anonymous data objects, which can also be indirect.

-   It is recommended that only global data types together with AREA HANDLE are used. As an occasional replacement for the direct reference to data elements and table types of the ABAP Dictionary, the respective types can be created in global interfaces, classes, or even type pools.

Description

The addition AREA HANDLE is used to create an anonymous data object of type string as a [shared object](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenshared_object_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in an [area instance version](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenarea_instance_version_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the area CL\_DEMO\_AREA. The generically typed attribute dref of the [area root class](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenroot_data_class_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") CL\_DEMO\_ROOT is used to refer to a variable. A field symbol is used to dereference the data reference and assign a value to the anonymous data object.

After write access has been completed using DETACH\_COMMIT, a read is performed to demonstrate how the objects in the shared memory are accessed. Such accesses can also be made in another program, as long as the area instance version exists in the shared memory.

Effect

The statement CREATE OBJECT creates an instance of a class or an object and assigns the reference to the object of the reference variable oref. The instance constructor of the class is called directly after the object is created.

By default, the object is created in the [internal session](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeninternal_session_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") (or [heap](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenheap_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")) of the current program and is preserved there for as long as it is required. If no more [heap references](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenheap_reference_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") point to the object, the following applies:

-   No more object references point to the object.

-   No data reference and no field symbol points to an instance attribute or to a part of an instance attribute,

Also, if no more methods of the object are registered as event handlers, it is deleted by the [Garbage Collector](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abengarbage_collector_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The addition [area\_handle](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcreate_object_area_handle.htm) can be used to create the object as a [shared object](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenshared_object_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

The reference variable oref must be declared as an object reference variable. Instance components of an object created using CREATE OBJECT can only be accessed using object reference variables (see [Data Objects in Operand Positions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenoperands_data_objects.htm)).

The addition TYPE can be used to specify the class of the created object. The static type of the object reference variables must be more general than or identical to the class of the created object, in accordance with the rules for [Assignments Between Object Reference Variables](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconversion_references_objects.htm).

Instances of a class can be created only where it is allowed by the addition CREATE of the statement [CLASS DEFINITION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapclass.htm). It can be a local class of the same ABAP program or a global class of the class library allowed by the package check.

The additions [parameter\_list](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcreate_object_parameters.htm) and [parameter\_tables](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcreate_object_para_tables.htm) must be used to fill the non-optional input parameters of the first explicitly implemented instance constructor that is on the path of the inheritance tree between the instantiated class and the root class object. These additions can also be used to assign return values to the non-class-based exceptions of the instance constructor.

If a catchable exception is raised when the object is created in the runtime environment, the object is not created and the object reference variable oref is initialized. If a catchable exception is raised when the object is created in the instance constructor of the class, the created object is deleted and the object reference variable oref is initialized.

Return Code

If the CREATE OBJECT statement is executed successfully, sy-subrc is set to 0. Values other than 0 can occur when specifying EXCEPTIONS in parameter\_spec when non-class-based exceptions of the instance constructor are handled.

Hints

-   If the reference variable oref specified after CREATE OBJECT is passed simultaneously to the instance constructor, it already points to the new object when it is executed. To pass a reference to an existing object to the instance constructor, a different reference variable must be used.

-   The statement CREATE OBJECT creates a [heap reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenheap_reference_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). All references that point to the object or its parts are also heap references and keep the object alive. The same applies to field symbols that point to instance attributes or to their parts.

-   If a class is used, the [instance operator](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeninstance_operator_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [NEW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconstructor_expression_new.htm) acts like the statement CREATE OBJECT oref TYPE class and can be used in [general expression positions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abengeneral_expr_position_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

-   The return code sy-subrc is set to 0 if the statement is successful because the instance constructor is called. sy-subrc is set each time a [method is called](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall_method_static_short.htm).
    

[Exceptions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_language_exceptions.htm)

Catchable Exceptions

CX\_SY\_CREATE\_OBJECT\_ERROR

-   Cause: An attempt was made to instantiate an abstract class.
    Runtime error: CREATE\_OBJECT\_CLASS\_ABSTRACT

-   Cause: The class specified in the addition TYPE does not exist.

CREATE OBJECT oref

[Short Reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcreate_object_shortref.htm)

Syntax

CREATE OBJECT oref *\[* [area\_handle](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcreate_object_area_handle.htm)*\]* *\[* [parameter\_list](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcreate_object_parameters.htm)*\]*.

Effect

If the addition TYPE is not specified, the object reference variable oref must be a class reference variable. An instance of the class is created that is the static type of the object reference variable. The static type of the class reference variable must not be an [abstract](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabstract_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") class, and in particular not the root class object.

Hint

If the character # is used in an operand position with the operand type of a class reference variable, the [instance operator](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeninstance_operator_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [NEW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconstructor_expression_new.htm) works like the statement CREATE DATA dref.

Effect

Creation of an instance of an explicitly specified class. A [concrete](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconcrete_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") class that is more specific than or identical to the static type of the object reference variable oref can be specified. The reference variable oref can be a class reference variable or an interface reference variable. The name of the class can be specified as follows:

-   class

Direct static specification as class.

-   (name)

Specification as the content of a character-like data object name. The data object name must contain the name of the class in uppercase letters when the statement is executed. The class name in name can also be an [absolute type name](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabsolute_typename_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The following can be specified for name:

-   Literal or constant
    If the data object name is specified as a character literal or as a constant, it can be evaluated statically and the specified class is identified as the used object.

-   Variable
    If the data object name is specified as a variable, it is specified only dynamically and the content is not evaluated statically.

When the statement is executed, name is not evaluated until runtime (in both cases).

The class must be usable at the current position:

-   The addition [CREATE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapclass_options.htm) of the class definition must allow objects to be created.

-   The package check must allow an object of a global class to be created.

Hints

-   If the class is specified dynamically, the parameters can either be specified statically in [parameter\_list](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcreate_object_parameters.htm) or dynamically in [parameter\_tables](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcreate_object_para_tables.htm).

-   When a class is used, the [instance operator](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeninstance_operator_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [NEW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconstructor_expression_new.htm) acts like the statement CREATE OBJECT oref TYPE class and can be used in [general expression positions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abengeneral_expr_position_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The dynamic specification of name is not possible here.

Security Hint

Dynamic object creation can present a serious security risk if used incorrectly. Names of classes that are passed to a program from the outside must be checked thoroughly before being used in dynamic statements. The system class CL\_ABAP\_DYN\_PRG, for example, is used to do this. See [Dynamic Calls](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendyn_call_scrty.htm).

Example

Creation of an instance of a class cls using an explicit reference to the class. The static type of the reference variable is the root class object and is therefore more general than any other class. Components must be accessed dynamically or a cast must be performed as shown here.

CLASS cls DEFINITION.
¬†¬†PUBLIC SECTION.
¬†¬†¬†¬†DATA attr TYPE string VALUE 'Object'.

[Short Reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcreate_object_shortref.htm)

Syntax

CREATE OBJECT oref AREA HANDLE handle ...

Effect

This statement creates an object as a [shared object](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenshared_object_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in the [area instance version](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenarea_instance_version_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the [shared memory](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenshared_memory_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), to which the [area handle](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenarea_handle_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") referenced by handle is bound. The implicitly or explicitly specified class must be defined as a [shared-memory-enabled class](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenshm_class_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") using the addition [SHARED MEMORY ENABLED](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapclass_options.htm) of the statement [CLASS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapclass_definition.htm).

For handle, an object reference variable whose static type is [CL\_ABAP\_MEMORY\_AREA](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenshm_cl_abap_memory_area.htm) or one of its subclasses ([area class](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenarea_class_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")) must be specified. When the statement is executed, handle must point to an [area handle](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenarea_handle_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and the area handle must be bound to an area instance version with a change lock. A reference like this can be created in one of the following ways:

-   By inheriting the return value of the methods [ATTACH\_FOR\_WRITE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenshm_area_class.htm) or [ATTACH\_FOR\_UPDATE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenshm_area_class.htm) of an area class created using transaction SHMA.
    

-   By inheriting the return value of the method [GET\_HANDLE\_BY\_...](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenshm_cl_abap_memory_area.htm) of any area class.
    

-   By inheriting the return value of the method [GET\_IMODE\_HANDLE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenshm_cl_imode_area.htm) of the predefined class CL\_IMODE\_AREA.

The latter is a reference to an area handle for the current [internal session](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeninternal_session_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and the statement CREATE OBJECT works in the same way as without the addition AREA HANDLE.

Hints

-   The only shared object that can be addressed from an ABAP program directly after a binding is made to an area instance version is the instance of the [area root class](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenroot_data_class_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). All other objects must be referenced in this instance.

-   The static attributes of a shared object are not created in the shared memory, but when the shared-memory-enabled class is loaded into the internal session of a program, as for every class. This means that they can exist multiple times and independently of one another in different programs.
    

Example

Creation of a shared object in an area instance version of the area CL\_DEMO\_AREA.

¬†¬†...

Description

If the addition AREA HANDLE is used, an instance of the local class class is created as a [shared object](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenshared_object_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in an [area instance version](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenarea_instance_version_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the area CL\_DEMO\_AREA. The generically typed attribute oref of the [area root class](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenroot_data_class_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") CL\_DEMO\_ROOT is used as a reference variable. The attribute attr of the object is given a value by calling its method set\_attr.

After write access has been completed using the method DETACH\_COMMIT, a read is performed to demonstrate how the objects in the shared memory are accessed. Such an access can also be made in another program, as long as the area instance version exists in the shared memory.

CREATE OBJECT, AREA HANDLE

[Short Reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcreate_object_shortref.htm)

Syntax

CREATE OBJECT oref AREA HANDLE handle ...

Effect

This statement creates an object as a [shared object](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenshared_object_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in the [area instance version](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenarea_instance_version_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the [shared memory](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenshared_memory_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), to which the [area handle](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenarea_handle_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") referenced by handle is bound. The implicitly or explicitly specified class must be defined as a [shared-memory-enabled class](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenshm_class_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") using the addition [SHARED MEMORY ENABLED](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapclass_options.htm) of the statement [CLASS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapclass_definition.htm).

For handle, an object reference variable whose static type is [CL\_ABAP\_MEMORY\_AREA](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenshm_cl_abap_memory_area.htm) or one of its subclasses ([area class](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenarea_class_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")) must be specified. When the statement is executed, handle must point to an [area handle](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenarea_handle_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and the area handle must be bound to an area instance version with a change lock. A reference like this can be created in one of the following ways:

-   By inheriting the return value of the methods [ATTACH\_FOR\_WRITE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenshm_area_class.htm) or [ATTACH\_FOR\_UPDATE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenshm_area_class.htm) of an area class created using transaction SHMA.
    

-   By inheriting the return value of the method [GET\_HANDLE\_BY\_...](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenshm_cl_abap_memory_area.htm) of any area class.
    

-   By inheriting the return value of the method [GET\_IMODE\_HANDLE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenshm_cl_imode_area.htm) of the predefined class CL\_IMODE\_AREA.

The latter is a reference to an area handle for the current [internal session](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeninternal_session_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and the statement CREATE OBJECT works in the same way as without the addition AREA HANDLE.

Hints

-   The only shared object that can be addressed from an ABAP program directly after a binding is made to an area instance version is the instance of the [area root class](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenroot_data_class_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). All other objects must be referenced in this instance.

-   The static attributes of a shared object are not created in the shared memory, but when the shared-memory-enabled class is loaded into the internal session of a program, as for every class. This means that they can exist multiple times and independently of one another in different programs.
    

Example

Creation of a shared object in an area instance version of the area CL\_DEMO\_AREA.

CLASS cls DEFINITION
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†SHARED MEMORY ENABLED.
¬†¬†...

... *\[*EXPORTING¬†¬†p1 = a1 p2 = a2 ...*\]*
¬†¬†¬†¬†*\[*EXCEPTIONS exc1 = n1 exc2 = n2 ... *\[*OTHERS = n\_others*\]**\]*.

Effect

The additions EXPORTING and EXCEPTIONS are used to pass actual parameters to the instance constructor statically or to assign return values to non-class-based exceptions.

-   The addition EXPORTING must be used to supply the non-optional input parameters p1 p2 ... of the instance constructor of the instantiated class with the type-compliant actual parameters a1 a2 .... The other input parameters are optional. As in regular method calls, a1, a2, ... are [general expression positions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abengeneral_expr_position_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). This means that functions and expressions can be passed as actual parameters in addition to data objects. [Special rules](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abentyping_arith_expr.htm) apply in this case. If a subclass does not have an instance constructor implemented explicitly, the interface of the instance constructor from the next-highest superclass that explicitly implements the instance constructor is filled.

-   The addition EXCEPTIONS can be used to assign return values to [non-class-based exceptions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenexceptions_non_class.htm) exc1 exc2...

The syntax and semantics are the same as in the parameter list for [static method calls](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenmethod_calls_static.htm).

Example

Creation of a Control Framework (CFW) dialog box and passes input parameters to the instance constructor of the global class CL\_GUI\_DIALOGBOX\_CONTAINER. The class is defined implicitly using the static type of the reference variable dialog\_box.

DATA dialog\_box TYPE REF TO cl\_gui\_dialogbox\_container.
CREATE OBJECT dialog\_box
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† EXPORTING parent = cl\_gui\_container=>desktop

Syntax

... *\[*PARAMETER-TABLE ptab*\]*
¬†¬†¬†¬†*\[*EXCEPTION-TABLE etab*\]*.

Effect

The additions PARAMETER-TABLE and EXCEPTION-TABLE are used to pass actual parameters dynamically to the instance constructor or assign return values to the non-class-based exceptions.

These additions can only be used if the instantiated class is specified dynamically in name. They use special internal tables ptab and etab to assign actual parameters to the input parameters of the instance constructor or return values to the non-class-based exceptions.

The syntax and semantics are the same as in the dynamic method calls using the statement [CALL METHOD](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall_method_dynamic.htm). The internal tables ptab and etab in particular must be defined with reference to the tables abap\_parmbind\_tab and abap\_excpbind\_tab from the [type pool](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abentype_pool_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") ABAP.

Example

Dynamic creation of a [Control Framework](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencontrol_framework_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") (CFW) dialog box and dynamic passing of input parameters to the instance constructor of the global class CL\_GUI\_DIALOGBOX\_CONTAINER. The class is defined explicitly using the addition [TYPE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcreate_object_explicit.htm).

Example

The following program section dynamically creates an object of a class SOME\_CLASS whose instance constructor expects a reference variable of the static type ANY\_CLASS. The program has correct syntax, but the object is created only in systems in which the classes also exist.

The result is a reference variable that points to the created object. The following can be specified for type:

-   A non-generic data type dtype.
    The operator NEW works in the same way as the statement [CREATE DATA dref TYPE dtype](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcreate_data_existing.htm), where dref stands for the result that points to the created anonymous data object. The result is a data reference variable of the [static type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenstatic_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") dtype. A constructor expression of this type cannot be extended using a [component selector](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencomponent_selector_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

-   A class class.
    The operator NEW works in the same way as the statement [CREATE OBJECT oref TYPE class](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcreate_object_explicit.htm), where oref stands for the result that points to the created object. The result is an object reference variable of the [static type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenstatic_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") class. Such a constructor expression can be extended in [general expression positions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abengeneral_expression_positions.htm) and [functional positions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenfunctional_positions.htm) like an object reference variable with an component selector \-> and can be used in the same operand positions. The following is also possible:

-   [Standalone method calls](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall_method_static_short.htm), including [chained method calls](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenchained_method_call_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), can be introduced.

-   A single expression that points to an attribute of the class using exactly one subsequent object component selector can also be used as the target field of assignments.

-   The # character.
    If the data type required in an operand position is unique and can be identified completely, the # character can be used instead of an explicit type specification type and the [operand type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenoperand_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is used. If the operand type cannot be identified completely, the # character cannot be used, with the following exception: The operand can be evaluated after BASE when a [structure](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abennew_constructor_params_struct.htm) or an [internal table](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abennew_constructor_params_itab.htm) is constructed.

The same descriptions apply as to the CREATE statements. After successful object creation, it is supplied with values using the parameters specified in parentheses. The syntax of the parameter passing depends on the type used. There are specialized types of parameter passing for complex types.

-   [Initial value for all types](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abennew_constructor_params_initial.htm)

-   [Initial value for all data types](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abennew_constructor_params_single.htm)

-   [Structures](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abennew_constructor_params_struct.htm)

-   [Internal tables](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abennew_constructor_params_itab.htm)

-   [Classes](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abennew_constructor_params_class.htm)

If a constructor expression is [assigned](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenequals_operator.htm) to a reference variable using NEW, the information in the parentheses is evaluated before the created object is bound to the target variable.

Return Code

If an instance of a [class](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abennew_constructor_params_class.htm) is created successfully, the instance operator NEW sets sy-subrc to 0. Since non-class-based exceptions of the instance constructor cannot be handled, sy-subrc is never set to a value other than 0. The return code sy-subrc is not set when anonymous data objects are created.

Hints

-   To create the values for a new data object, the instance operator NEW uses mainly the same syntax as the value operator [VALUE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconstructor_expression_value.htm).

-   The instance operator NEW always creates a new temporary reference variable that points to the created object. The reference variable is used as the operand of a statement and then deleted. It is deleted when the current statement is closed or after the evaluation of a relational expression once the truth value is determined. The created object is passed to the Garbage Collector if it is not received by a [heap reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenheap_reference_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or a field symbol after the temporary reference variable has been deleted.

-   [Assignments](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenequals_operator.htm) to a reference variable also always create a temporary reference variable that is only assigned to the target variable afterwards. This means that the object to which the target variable points before the assignment can be addressed using it throughout the entire expression. This is the difference between NEW and the value operator [VALUE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconstructor_expression_value.htm).

Example

Creation of an anonymous data object of the type i with the value 555 and an instance of a local class cls whereby this is derived implicitly from the static type of oref. In this case, the last statement could be written as explicitly as oref = NEW cls( ) or as DATA(oref) = NEW cls( ), using an inline declaration instead of the preceding DATA statement.

CLASS cls DEFINITION.
¬†¬†...
ENDCLASS.
DATA: dref TYPE REF TO data,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†oref TYPE REF TO cls.
dref = NEW i( 555 ).
oref = NEW #( ).

NEW, Initial Value for All Types

Syntax

... NEW dtype*|*class*|*#( ) ...

Effect

If no parameter is specified,

-   an anonymous data object retains its type-specific initial value,

-   no values are passed to the instance constructor of an object.

This is possible for every non-generic data type dtype. The instance constructor of a class class can either have only optional input parameters or no input parameters at all. The # symbol can stand for corresponding types.

Hint

If dtype or # stand for an [enumerated type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenenumerated_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), its initial value is created according to its [base type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbase_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Example

After the following program section is executed, dref points to an empty internal table with the line type T100. Both constructor expressions have the same function.

TYPES t\_itab TYPE TABLE OF t100 WITH EMPTY KEY.
DATA dref TYPE REF TO t\_itab.
dref = NEW #( ).
dref = NEW t\_itab( ).

NEW, Single Value for All Data Types

Syntax

... NEW dtype*|*#( *\[*[let\_exp](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abaplet.htm)*\]* dobj ) ...

Effect

If dtype is a non-generic elementary data type, a structured type, a table type, or a reference type or # for a type like this, a single data object dobj can be specified as a unnamed argument that is convertible to or from data type dtype. dobj is a [general expression position](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abengeneral_expr_position_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The value of dobj is assigned to the created anonymous data object. The assignment is made in accordance with the applicable [assignment rules](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconversion_rules.htm). Optionally, a LET expression [let\_exp](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abaplet.htm) can be specified in front of the data object to define local helper fields.

Hints

-   An expression specified for dobj can particularly be or contain a constructor expression or contain a constructor expression.

-   When a constructor expression is assigned to a reference variable using NEW, the original reference is available in the entire expression in the target variable. The target variable is not overwritten until the expression is completed.

Example

Construction of an anonymous data object of the type string, whose value is determined using a string expression.

DATA input TYPE c LENGTH 10 VALUE 'World'.
cl\_demo\_input=>request( CHANGING field = input ).
DATA dref TYPE REF TO string.
dref =¬†¬†NEW string( \`Hello \` && input && \`!\` ).
cl\_demo\_output=>display( dref->\* ).

Example

For each line read, a structured anonymous data object is created in a SELECT loop, to which the content of the line is assigned. The object is created in the general expression position of the statement APPEND and the created data reference is appended directly to an internal table with the appropriate line type. The result is a table that references all new anonymous data objects.

DATA dref\_tab LIKE TABLE OF REF TO t100 WITH EMPTY KEY.
DATA wa TYPE t100.
SELECT \*
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† FROM t100
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† WHERE sprsl = @sy-langu
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† INTO @wa.
¬†¬†APPEND NEW #( wa ) TO dref\_tab.
ENDSELECT.

Syntax

... NEW dtype*|*#( *\[*[let\_exp](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abaplet.htm)*\]*
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† *\[*BASE dobj*\]*
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† comp1 = dobj1 comp2 = dobj2 ... ) ...

Effect

If dtype is a structured data type or # stands for such a type, the individual components can be specified as named arguments comp1, comp2, ... Each component of the created anonymous data object can be assigned a data object with the same data type as the component, or can be converted to it. The assignment is made for all data types in accordance with the corresponding [assignment rules](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconversion_rules.htm).

An addition BASE can be specified in front of the individual component assignments, followed by a data object dobj. dobj is a [functional operand position](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenfunctional_position_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The type of dobj must be convertible to the type of the anonymous data object. If BASE is specified, the content of dobj is assigned to the anonymous data object before the individual components are assigned. If the character # is specified for the type of the anonymous data object and the type cannot be determined from the operand position of the VALUE expression, the type of dobj is used for this expression if it is known and structured.

dobj1, dobj2, ... are [general expression positions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abengeneral_expr_position_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). Optionally, a LET expression [let\_exp](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abaplet.htm) can be specified in front of the assignments to define local helper fields that can be used on the right side of the assignments.

If a component is structured itself, either a suitable data object can be assigned to the entire substructure or its components can be specified using the structure component selector (\-). Non-specified components are ignored and keep their type-specific initial value, or the value assigned using BASE. It is not possible to assign multiple values to a component, regardless of how the component is addressed. If the addition BASE is used, at least one component must also be specified.

Hints

-   The assignments can be specified in any order in parentheses.

-   If a component with a complex data type is to be constructed in an argument position, the value operator [VALUE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconstructor_expression_value.htm) can be used. This affects tabular components, for example. This is also possible for structured components but is not necessary since the subcomponents can be addressed using the structure component selector.

-   When a constructor expression is assigned to a reference variable using NEW, the original reference is available in the entire expression in the target variable. The target variable is not overwritten until the expression is completed. In the case of the value operator [VALUE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenvalue_constructor_params_struc.htm), however, the target variable can only be assigned to a helper variable using LET and is then no longer available.

Example

Construction of an anonymous data object with a nested structure type and tabular components. The subcomponents of col2 are addressed directly using the structure component selector. [VALUE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconstructor_expression_value.htm) must be used to construct the tabular component col3 because the [syntax](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abennew_constructor_params_itab.htm) for constructing internal tables cannot be specified directly as an argument.

TYPES: t\_itab TYPE TABLE OF i WITH EMPTY KEY,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† BEGIN OF t\_struct,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† col1 TYPE i,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† BEGIN OF col2,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† col1 TYPE i,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† col2 TYPE t\_itab,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† END OF col2,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† col3 TYPE t\_itab,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† END OF t\_struct.
DATA itab TYPE t\_itab.
DATA dref TYPE REF TO data.
dref = NEW t\_struct( col1 = 1
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† col2-col1 = 2
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† col2-col2 = itab
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† col3 = VALUE #( ( 1 )
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ( 2 )

Example

Use of BASE. The type of the return value of base1 is transferred in the construction of ref1. This is not possible in the construction of ref2, since base2 is not structured. In both results, col1 and col3 have the values xx or zz assigned using BASE, whereas col2 has the directly assigned value BB.

TYPES:
¬†¬†BEGIN OF struct,
¬†¬†¬†¬†col1 TYPE c LENGTH 2,
¬†¬†¬†¬†col2 TYPE c LENGTH 2,
¬†¬†¬†¬†col3 TYPE c LENGTH 2,
¬†¬†END OF struct.
DATA(base1) = VALUE struct( col1 = 'xx' col2 = 'yy' col3 = 'zz' ).
DATA(ref1)¬†¬†= NEW #( BASE base1 col2 = 'BB' ).
DATA(base2)¬†¬† = \`xxyyzz\`.
DATA(ref2)¬†¬†= NEW struct( BASE base2 col2 = 'BB' ).
cl\_demo\_output=>write(¬†¬† ref1->\* ).
cl\_demo\_output=>display( ref2->\* ).

Additions:

[1\. ... BASE itab](#!ABAP_ADDITION_1@1@)
[2\. ... FOR for\_exp](#!ABAP_ADDITION_2@2@)

Effect

If dtype is a tabular data type or # stands for such a type, the table lines of the constructed table are created as follows:

-   The first option is to list a LET expression [let\_exp](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abaplet.htm) to define local helper fields whose values can be used to construct the table lines.

-   An optional start value for the content can then be specified for the content of the internal table after BASE (see below).

-   One or more optional consecutive [iteration expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeniteration_expression_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") can then be specified using [FOR](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenfor.htm) (see below).

-   The table lines are then constructed in one or more sets of internal parentheses by specifying [line\_spec](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abennew_constructor_params_lspc.htm). Each set of inner parentheses constructs one or more lines in accordance with the information in line\_spec and inserts them into the new internal table according to the rules for the statement [INSERT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapinsert_itab.htm) ... [INTO TABLE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapinsert_itab_position.htm). The object is inserted in the order of the parentheses.

The constructed lines must meet the requirements of the statement [INSERT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapinsert_itab.htm) for inserting work areas using table keys and therefore be compatible with the line type, with one exception: when constructing a [standard table](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenstandard_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") where the lines are only appended anyway, the value can be shorter than the line length for line types c and x and then padded on the right with blanks or hexadecimal 0.

Hints

-   When a constructor expression is assigned to a reference variable using NEW, the original reference is available in the entire expression in the target variable. The target variable is not overwritten until the expression is completed. In the case of the value operator [VALUE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenvalue_constructor_params_itab.htm), however, the target variable can only be assigned to a helper variable using LET and is then no longer available.

-   The operand type for [line\_spec](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abennew_constructor_params_lspc.htm) in the inner parentheses is the line type of the table type specified using dtype or # and is always uniquely identifiable. Constructor expressions at this position can therefore always derive the required data type using #.
    

Example

Construction of an anonymous internal table with a structured line type with substructures and tabular components.

TYPES: BEGIN OF t\_struct1,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† col1 TYPE i,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† col2 TYPE i,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† END OF t\_struct1,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† BEGIN OF t\_struct2,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† col1 TYPE i,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† col2 TYPE t\_struct1,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† col3 TYPE TABLE OF t\_struct1 WITH EMPTY KEY,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† END OF t\_struct2,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† t\_itab TYPE TABLE OF t\_struct2 WITH EMPTY KEY.
DATA dref TYPE REF TO data.
dref = NEW t\_itab( ( col1 = 1
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† col2-col1 = 1
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† col2-col2 = 2
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† col3 = VALUE #( ( col1 = 1 col2 = 2 )
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ( col1 = 3 col2 = 4 ) ) )
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ( col1 = 2
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† col2-col1 = 2
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† col2-col2 = 4
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† col3 = VALUE #( ( col1 = 2 col2 = 4 )
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ( col1 = 6 col2 = 8 ) ) ) ).

Examples

See also the examples for the value operator [VALUE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenvalue_constructor_params_itab.htm).

Addition 1

... BASE itab

Effect

An addition, BASE, followed by an internal table, itab, can be specified in front of the specification of lines to be inserted, which is a [functional operand position](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenfunctional_position_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The line type of itab must be convertible to the line type of the return value. If BASE is specified, the content of itab is assigned to the return value before the individual lines are inserted. If the character # is specified for the type of the return value and the type cannot be determined from the operand position of the constructor expression, the type of itab is used for this expression if it is known.

Example

Construction of three anonymous internal tables with an elementary line type. The first table is filled with three lines, whereby the second inserted line is initial. The second and third tables are filled with the lines of the first table and three further lines. Using BASE and [LINES OF](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abennew_constructor_params_lspc.htm) here has the same effect here.

TYPES t\_itab TYPE TABLE OF i WITH EMPTY KEY.
DATA(dref1) = NEW t\_itab( ( 1 ) (¬†¬†) ( 3 ) ).
DATA(dref2) = NEW t\_itab( BASE dref1->\*
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†(¬†¬† ) ( 5 ) (¬†¬†) ).
DATA(dref3) = NEW t\_itab( ( LINES OF dref1->\* )
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†(¬†¬† ) ( 5 ) (¬†¬†) ).
cl\_demo\_output=>write(¬†¬† dref1->\* ).
cl\_demo\_output=>write(¬†¬† dref2->\* ).
cl\_demo\_output=>display( dref3->\* ).

Addition 2

... FOR for\_exp

Effect

If one or more [iteration expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeniteration_expression_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") are specified consecutively using [FOR](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenfor.htm), the lines constructed in [line\_spec](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abennew_constructor_params_lspc.htm) for each iteration of the last FOR expression are inserted into the target table. When constructing table lines in [line\_spec](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abennew_constructor_params_lspc.htm), the visible local work areas and field symbols of the iteration expressions can be used to construct table lines.

-   If [conditional iterations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenfor_conditional.htm) are used, the new table lines are created in freely definable iteration steps.

-   If [table iterations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenfor_itab.htm) are used, the lines of existing internal tables are evaluated. In this case, these are known as [table comprehensions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abentable_comprehension_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), since new table lines are constructed from the lines of existing internal tables.

Hints

-   The term "table comprehension" is derived from similar concepts used in many other languages, where it is also referred to as "list comprehension".

-   [Table filtering](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abentable_filtering_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") can be achieved more efficiently using the [filter operator](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenfilter_operator_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [FILTER](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconstructor_expression_filter.htm).

-   Conditional iterations and table comprehensions are also possible with [FOR expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenmesh_for.htm) for [mesh paths](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenmesh_path_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
    

Example

Construction of an anonymous internal table with an elementary line type and filling it with square numbers using an iteration expression.

TYPES t\_itab TYPE TABLE OF i WITH EMPTY KEY.
DATA(dref) = NEW t\_itab( FOR i = 1 UNTIL i > 10
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ( ipow( base = i exp = 2 ) ) ).
cl\_demo\_output=>display( dref->\* ).

NEW, line\_spec

Syntax

... line
¬†¬†*|* *{*LINES OF jtab *\[*FROM idx1*\]* *\[*TO idx2*\]* *\[*USING KEY keyname*\]**}* ...

Alternatives:

[1\. ... line](#!ABAP_ALTERNATIVE_1@1@)
[2\. ... LINES OF jtab *\[*FROM idx1*\]* *\[*TO idx2*\]* *\[*USING KEY keyname*\]*](#!ABAP_ALTERNATIVE_2@2@)

Effect

Specification of one or more lines to be inserted when constructing an internal table with the instance operator [NEW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abennew_constructor_params_itab.htm).

Alternative 1

... line

Effect

Specification of a line. For line, the exact same specifications can be made as in the parentheses of an expression [NEW line\_type( ... )](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconstructor_expression_new.htm), where line\_type is the line type of the internal table and a corresponding line is constructed. The following special features apply here:

-   If a data object is specified for line, this object must be compatible with the line type.

-   If an expression (built-in function, functional method, calculation expression, constructor expression, or table expression) is specified for line, the result of the expression must be convertible to the line type.

-   The syntax does not allow further parentheses for constructing tabular line types to be nested directly in line.

Short Form for Structured Line Types

If the line type of the internal table is a structured type, the following short form can be used:

NEW dtype*|*#( *\[*let\_exp*\]*
¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† *\[*BASE itab*\]*
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† col1 = dobj11 ... ( col2 = dobj12 col3 = dobj13 ... )
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ( col2 = dobj22 col3 = dobj23 ... )
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ...
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† col1 = dobj31 col2 = dobj32 ... ( col3 = dobj33 ... )
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ( col3 = dobj43 ... )
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ... ).

This has the same semantics as the following form:

NEW dtype*|*#( *\[*let\_exp*\]*
¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† *\[*BASE itab*\]*
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ( col1 = dobj11 ... col2 = dobj12 col3 = dobj13 ... )
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ( col1 = dobj11 ... col2 = dobj22 col3 = dobj23 ... )
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ...
¬†¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ( col1 = dobj31 col2 = dobj32 ... col3 = dobj33 ... )
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ( col1 = dobj31 col2 = dobj32 ... col3 = dobj43 ... )
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ... ).

Values can be assigned to individual structure components outside of the inner parentheses. An assignment of this type applies to all subsequent inner parentheses until the next assignment is made to the corresponding component. Assignments outside of the inner parentheses must be followed by at least one inner parenthesis. Since a component cannot be assigned a value more than once in the [construction of a structure](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abennew_constructor_params_struct.htm), a component that has been assigned a value outside of the inner parentheses can no longer be listed in an inner parenthesis. A component can be listed again outside the inner parentheses and any components previously listed in an inner parenthesis can also be listed outside the parenthesis.

Hints

-   The restriction that the content of tabular line types cannot be constructed directly in line applies for reasons of legibility (for humans and for machines) and is not a functional restriction. The expression [VALUE line\_type( ... )](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconstructor_expression_value.htm) can be specified for line to construct the content of a tabular line, where line\_type is the tabular line type.

-   By specifying [CONV line\_type( ... )](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconstructor_expression_conv.htm) for the values to be inserted, the compatibility requirement for the line type can be met.

-   The short form for structured line types enables columns of internal tables that are to contain an identical value in blocks to be filled more easily.
    

Example

Construction of an anonymous internal table with a structured line type with a short form for the first column:

TYPES:
¬†¬†BEGIN OF t\_line,
¬†¬†¬†¬†col1 TYPE i,
¬†¬†¬†¬†col2 TYPE i,
¬†¬†END OF t\_line,
¬†¬†t\_itab TYPE TABLE OF t\_line WITH EMPTY KEY.
DATA(dref) = NEW t\_itab( col1 = 1 ( col2 = 11 )
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†( col2 = 12 )
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†( col2 = 13 )
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† col1 = 2 ( col2 = 21 )
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†( col2 = 22 )
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†( col2 = 23 ) ).
cl\_demo\_output=>display( dref->\* ).

Alternative 2

... LINES OF jtab *\[*FROM idx1*\]* *\[*TO idx2*\]* *\[*USING KEY keyname*\]*

Effect

Specification of multiple lines. The lines are taken from the internal table jtab and inserted into the target table as a block. The same applies to jtab and the additions FROM, TO, and USING KEY as to the addition [LINES OF](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapinsert_itab_linespec.htm) of the statement [INSERT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapinsert_itab.htm) and the block is inserted in accordance with these rules. jtab is a [functional operand position](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenfunctional_position_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Hints

-   Since the lines from jtab are inserted into the target table using only the table key, jtab must be compatible with the target type.

-   If there is a conflict with an existing unique table key, an uncatchable exception is always raised when inserting multiple lines from an internal table using the statement [INSERT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapinsert_itab.htm).

-   When standard tables are created, the lines of the table jtab are appended to the target table in the same way as with the statement [APPEND LINES OF](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapappend_linespec.htm).

Example

Construction of an internal table itab that contain the first three lines and last three rows of the previously constructed internal table alpha.

DATA:
¬†¬†alpha TYPE TABLE OF string WITH EMPTY KEY,
¬†¬†itab¬†¬†LIKE REF TO alpha.
alpha = VALUE #(¬†¬†FOR j = 0 UNTIL j >= strlen( sy-abcde )
¬†¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†( substring( val = sy-abcde
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† off = j
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† len = 1¬†¬†) ) ).
itab = NEW #( ( LINES OF alpha FROM 1 to 3 )
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†( \`-\` )
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†( LINES OF alpha FROM lines( alpha ) - 2
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† TO¬†¬† lines( alpha ) ) ).

Additions:

[1\. ... BASE itab](#!ABAP_ADDITION_1@1@)
[2\. ... FOR for\_exp](#!ABAP_ADDITION_2@2@)

Effect

If dtype is a tabular data type or # stands for such a type, the table lines of the constructed table are created as follows:

-   The first option is to list a LET expression [let\_exp](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abaplet.htm) to define local helper fields whose values can be used to construct the table lines.

-   An optional start value for the content can then be specified for the content of the internal table after BASE (see below).

-   One or more optional consecutive [iteration expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeniteration_expression_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") can then be specified using [FOR](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenfor.htm) (see below).

-   The table lines are then constructed in one or more sets of internal parentheses by specifying [line\_spec](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abennew_constructor_params_lspc.htm). Each set of inner parentheses constructs one or more lines in accordance with the information in line\_spec and inserts them into the new internal table according to the rules for the statement [INSERT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapinsert_itab.htm) ... [INTO TABLE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapinsert_itab_position.htm). The object is inserted in the order of the parentheses.

The constructed lines must meet the requirements of the statement [INSERT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapinsert_itab.htm) for inserting work areas using table keys and therefore be compatible with the line type, with one exception: when constructing a [standard table](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenstandard_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") where the lines are only appended anyway, the value can be shorter than the line length for line types c and x and then padded on the right with blanks or hexadecimal 0.

Hints

-   When a constructor expression is assigned to a reference variable using NEW, the original reference is available in the entire expression in the target variable. The target variable is not overwritten until the expression is completed. In the case of the value operator [VALUE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenvalue_constructor_params_itab.htm), however, the target variable can only be assigned to a helper variable using LET and is then no longer available.

-   The operand type for [line\_spec](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abennew_constructor_params_lspc.htm) in the inner parentheses is the line type of the table type specified using dtype or # and is always uniquely identifiable. Constructor expressions at this position can therefore always derive the required data type using #.
    

Example

Construction of an anonymous internal table with a structured line type with substructures and tabular components.

TYPES: BEGIN OF t\_struct1,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† col1 TYPE i,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† col2 TYPE i,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† END OF t\_struct1,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† BEGIN OF t\_struct2,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† col1 TYPE i,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† col2 TYPE t\_struct1,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† col3 TYPE TABLE OF t\_struct1 WITH EMPTY KEY,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† END OF t\_struct2,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† t\_itab TYPE TABLE OF t\_struct2 WITH EMPTY KEY.
DATA dref TYPE REF TO data.
dref = NEW t\_itab( ( col1 = 1
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† col2-col1 = 1
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† col2-col2 = 2
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† col3 = VALUE #( ( col1 = 1 col2 = 2 )
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ( col1 = 3 col2 = 4 ) ) )
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ( col1 = 2
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† col2-col1 = 2
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† col2-col2 = 4
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† col3 = VALUE #( ( col1 = 2 col2 = 4 )
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ( col1 = 6 col2 = 8 ) ) ) ).

Examples

See also the examples for the value operator [VALUE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenvalue_constructor_params_itab.htm).

Addition 1

... BASE itab

Effect

An addition, BASE, followed by an internal table, itab, can be specified in front of the specification of lines to be inserted, which is a [functional operand position](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenfunctional_position_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The line type of itab must be convertible to the line type of the return value. If BASE is specified, the content of itab is assigned to the return value before the individual lines are inserted. If the character # is specified for the type of the return value and the type cannot be determined from the operand position of the constructor expression, the type of itab is used for this expression if it is known.

Example

Construction of three anonymous internal tables with an elementary line type. The first table is filled with three lines, whereby the second inserted line is initial. The second and third tables are filled with the lines of the first table and three further lines. Using BASE and [LINES OF](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abennew_constructor_params_lspc.htm) here has the same effect here.

TYPES t\_itab TYPE TABLE OF i WITH EMPTY KEY.
DATA(dref1) = NEW t\_itab( ( 1 ) (¬†¬†) ( 3 ) ).
DATA(dref2) = NEW t\_itab( BASE dref1->\*
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†(¬†¬† ) ( 5 ) (¬†¬†) ).
DATA(dref3) = NEW t\_itab( ( LINES OF dref1->\* )
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†(¬†¬† ) ( 5 ) (¬†¬†) ).
cl\_demo\_output=>write(¬†¬† dref1->\* ).
cl\_demo\_output=>write(¬†¬† dref2->\* ).
cl\_demo\_output=>display( dref3->\* ).

Addition 2

... FOR for\_exp

Effect

If one or more [iteration expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeniteration_expression_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") are specified consecutively using [FOR](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenfor.htm), the lines constructed in [line\_spec](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abennew_constructor_params_lspc.htm) for each iteration of the last FOR expression are inserted into the target table. When constructing table lines in [line\_spec](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abennew_constructor_params_lspc.htm), the visible local work areas and field symbols of the iteration expressions can be used to construct table lines.

-   If [conditional iterations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenfor_conditional.htm) are used, the new table lines are created in freely definable iteration steps.

-   If [table iterations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenfor_itab.htm) are used, the lines of existing internal tables are evaluated. In this case, these are known as [table comprehensions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abentable_comprehension_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), since new table lines are constructed from the lines of existing internal tables.

Hints

-   The term "table comprehension" is derived from similar concepts used in many other languages, where it is also referred to as "list comprehension".

-   [Table filtering](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abentable_filtering_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") can be achieved more efficiently using the [filter operator](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenfilter_operator_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [FILTER](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconstructor_expression_filter.htm).

-   Conditional iterations and table comprehensions are also possible with [FOR expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenmesh_for.htm) for [mesh paths](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenmesh_path_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
    

Example

Construction of an anonymous internal table with an elementary line type and filling it with square numbers using an iteration expression.

TYPES t\_itab TYPE TABLE OF i WITH EMPTY KEY.
DATA(dref) = NEW t\_itab( FOR i = 1 UNTIL i > 10
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ( ipow( base = i exp = 2 ) ) ).
cl\_demo\_output=>display( dref->\* ).

NEW, Classes

Syntax

... NEW class*|*#( *\[*[let\_exp](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abaplet.htm)*\]* p1 = a1 p2 = a2 .. ) ...

Effect

If a class class is specified or # stands for a class like this, the non-optional input parameters p1 p2 ... of the instance constructor of the instantiated class must be filled with the type-compliant actual parameters a1 a2 ... The optional input parameters do not need to but can be filled. The description of the statement [CREATE OBJECT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcreate_object_parameters.htm) specifies how parameters are passed and which classes can be used. [No parameters](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abennew_constructor_params_initial.htm) are passed for a class without an explicit instance constructor. An optional LET expression [let\_exp](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abaplet.htm) can be specified in front of the parameter to define local helper fields.

Like an object reference variable of the type class, a constructor expression NEW class( ... ) can be specified in front of the [object component selector](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenobject_component_select_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") \-> and in [chained attribute accesses](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenchained_attribute_acc_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and [chained method calls](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenchained_method_call_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). A chained method call of this type can be specified as a [standalone statement](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall_method_static_chain.htm). The result is then retained for the duration of the statement. Even a single expression without a subsequent object component selector can be executed as a standalone statement. In this case, only the constructor that has a reference to the created object elsewhere is executed if this object needs to be retained.

In the special case of an attribute access NEW class( ... )->attr, the following applies:

-   It can be listed as a [writable expression](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenwritable_expression_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in a [result position](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenresult_position_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

-   If the data is suitable, a [specified offset/length](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenoffset_length_specific_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [+off(len)](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenoffset_length.htm) can be appended unless the chaining uses the statement ASSIGN as a [memory area](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapassign_mem_area_writable_exp.htm).

[Method chainings](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenmethod_chaining_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") cannot be specified between the constructor expression and the attribute here.

Hints

-   This is a functional call of the instance constructor. As in [function calls](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall_method_functional.htm) of [functional methods](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods_functional.htm), no [non-class-based exceptions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenexceptions_non_class.htm) can be handled.

-   When the instance constructor is called, the return code sy-subrc is set to 0. Values other than 0 are not possible, since non-class-based exceptions cannot be handled.

Example

Construction of an instance of the class c1 when the method m2 of the class c2 is called. which requires an input parameter of this type.

CLASS c1 DEFINITION.
¬†¬†PUBLIC SECTION.
¬†¬†¬†¬†METHODS constructor IMPORTING p1 TYPE i p2 TYPE i.
ENDCLASS.
CLASS c1 IMPLEMENTATION.
¬†¬†METHOD constructor.
¬†¬†¬†¬†...
¬†¬†ENDMETHOD.
ENDCLASS.
CLASS c2 DEFINITION.
¬†¬†PUBLIC SECTION.
¬†¬†¬†¬†CLASS-METHODS m2 IMPORTING oref TYPE REF TO c1.
ENDCLASS.
CLASS c2 IMPLEMENTATION.
¬†¬†METHOD m2.
¬†¬†¬†¬†...
¬†¬†ENDMETHOD.
ENDCLASS.
START-OF-SELECTION.
¬†¬†c2=>m2( NEW #( p1 = 1 p2 = 2 ) ).

Example

Use of a constructor expression with NEW in various positions. The temporary reference variable created using NEW is persisted during each statement.

CLASS c1 DEFINITION.
¬†¬†PUBLIC SECTION.
¬†¬†¬†¬†DATA¬†¬†¬†¬† a1 TYPE i.
¬†¬†¬†¬†METHODS: m1 RETURNING value(p) TYPE i,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† m2.
ENDCLASS.
CLASS c1 IMPLEMENTATION.
¬†¬†METHOD m1.
¬†¬†¬†¬†...
¬†¬†ENDMETHOD.
¬†¬†METHOD m2.
¬†¬†¬†¬†...
¬†¬†ENDMETHOD.
ENDCLASS.
DATA num TYPE i.
START-OF-SELECTION.
¬†¬†num = NEW c1( )->a1.
¬†¬†NEW c1( )->a1 = num.
¬†¬†num = NEW c1( )->m1( ).
¬†¬†NEW c1( )->m2( ).
¬†¬†NEW c1( ).

Example

Display of a time stamp created in a constructor that only exists while the statement is being executed.

CLASS utc DEFINITION.
¬†¬†PUBLIC SECTION.
¬†¬†¬†¬†DATA ts TYPE utclong.
¬†¬†¬†¬†METHODS constructor.
ENDCLASS.
CLASS utc IMPLEMENTATION.
¬†¬†METHOD constructor.
¬†¬†¬†¬†ts = utclong\_current( ).
¬†¬†ENDMETHOD.
ENDCLASS.
START-OF-SELECTION.
¬†¬†cl\_demo\_output=>display\_text(
¬†¬†¬†¬†|{ NEW utc( )->ts TIMESTAMP = ISO }| ).

Example

Constructor expression with NEW on the left side of an expression. Although the reference variable only exists during the statement, the reference to the object is assigned to the reference variable oref in the constructor of the class class, thus preserving the object.

CLASS class DEFINITION.
¬†¬†PUBLIC SECTION.
¬†¬†¬†¬†DATA attr TYPE string.
¬†¬†¬†¬†METHODS constructor.
ENDCLASS.
DATA oref TYPE REF TO class.
CLASS class IMPLEMENTATION.
¬†¬†METHOD constructor.
¬†¬†¬†¬†oref = me.
¬†¬†ENDMETHOD.
ENDCLASS.
START-OF-SELECTION.
¬†¬†NEW class( )->attr = 'foo'.
¬†¬†cl\_demo\_output=>display( oref->attr ).

Additions:

[1\. ... BASE itab](#!ABAP_ADDITION_1@1@)
[2\. ... FOR for\_exp](#!ABAP_ADDITION_2@2@)

Effect

If dtype is a tabular data type or # stands for such a type, the table lines of the constructed table are created as follows:

-   The first option is to list a LET expression [let\_exp](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abaplet.htm) to define local helper fields whose values can be used to construct the table lines.

-   An optional start value for the content can then be specified for the content of the internal table after BASE (see below).

-   One or more optional consecutive [iteration expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeniteration_expression_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") can then be specified using [FOR](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenfor.htm) (see below).

-   The table lines are then constructed in one or more sets of internal parentheses by specifying [line\_spec](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenvalue_constructor_params_lspc.htm). Each set of inner parentheses constructs one or more lines in accordance with the information in line\_spec and inserts them into the created internal table in accordance with the rules for the statement [INSERT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapinsert_itab.htm) ... [INTO TABLE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapinsert_itab_position.htm), with one difference: Any conflicts with an existing unique primary table key raise an exception of the class CX\_SY\_ITAB\_DUPLICATE\_KEY. The object is inserted in the order of the parentheses.

The constructed lines must meet the requirements of the statement [INSERT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapinsert_itab.htm) for inserting work areas using table keys and therefore be compatible with the line type, with one exception: when constructing a [standard table](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenstandard_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") where the lines are only appended anyway, the value can be shorter than the line length for line types c and x and then padded on the right with blanks or hexadecimal 0.

If the VALUE operator is used as the source of an assignment to an internal table, it is first initialized after the evaluation of a possible [LET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abaplet.htm) expression or is assigned the content of itab. Then, [line\_spec](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenvalue_constructor_params_lspc.htm) data is then evaluated and inserted directly into the target table.

Hints

-   In assignments of constructor expressions to an internal table, its existing lines cannot be used directly as an argument in [line\_spec](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenvalue_constructor_params_lspc.htm). This is because this table is deleted before line\_spec is evaluated or overwritten by the content of itab. If the entire internal table or lines from the left side are needed on the right side, however, they can be saved in local helper variables using a [LET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abaplet.htm) expression, since this expression is evaluated first.

-   The operand type for [line\_spec](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenvalue_constructor_params_lspc.htm) in the inner parentheses is the line type of the table type specified using dtype or #, which means it is always uniquely identifiable. Constructor expressions at this position can therefore always derive the required data type using #.
    

Example

Construction of an internal table with a structured line type and filling it with two lines. The structures are filled with values component by component.

TYPES: BEGIN OF t\_struct,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† col1 TYPE i,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† col2 TYPE i,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† END OF t\_struct,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† t\_itab TYPE TABLE OF t\_struct WITH EMPTY KEY.
DATA itab TYPE t\_itab.
itab = VALUE #( ( col1 = 1 col2 = 2 )
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†( col1 = 3 col2 = 4 ) ).

Example

Construction of an internal table with a tabular line type and filling it with two lines. The first line is assigned a table that is already filled. The second line is constructed using VALUE.

TYPES: t\_itab1 TYPE TABLE OF i¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† WITH EMPTY KEY,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† t\_itab2 TYPE TABLE OF t\_itab1 WITH EMPTY KEY.
DATA itab1 TYPE t\_itab1.
DATA itab2 TYPE t\_itab2.
itab1 = VALUE #( ( 1 ) ( 2 ) ( 3 ) ).
itab2 = VALUE #( ( itab1 )
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ( VALUE t\_itab1( ( 4 ) ( 5 ) ( 6 ) ) ) ).

Addition 1

... BASE itab

Effect

An addition, BASE, followed by an internal table, itab, can be specified in front of the specification of lines to be inserted, which is a [functional operand position](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenfunctional_position_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The line type of itab must be convertible to the line type of the return value. If BASE is specified, the content of itab is assigned to the return value before the individual lines are inserted. If the character # is specified for the type of the return value and the type cannot be determined from the operand position of the constructor expression, the type of itab is used for this expression if it is known.

Hints

-   Without the addition BASE, the content of tables can only be reconstructed using the value operator, but not extended. If the same table is specified after BASE to which the constructor expression is assigned, further lines can be inserted in this table.

-   If the target table is specified as itab after BASE in an assignment to an existing internal table, there is no assignment before [line\_spec](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenvalue_constructor_params_lspc.htm) is evaluated, but the target table simply keeps its value instead.
    

Example

Use of BASE. The table type of base1 or base2 is transferred in the construction of tab1 and tab2. This is not possible in the construction of tab3 since the line type of base2 is not structured and hence does not match the specification of individual components in the following parentheses. The type itab2 is specified explicitly for tab3. This is possible since the line type of base2 can be converted into this line type. Since sorted tables are constructed, the lines in the results are also sorted.

TYPES:
¬†¬†itab1 TYPE SORTED TABLE OF string WITH UNIQUE KEY table\_line,
¬†¬†BEGIN OF struct,

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†( col1 = 'x3' col2 = 'y3' col3 = 'z3' ) ).
DATA(tab1) = VALUE #( BASE base1
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ( \`A1B1B1\` )
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ( \`A2B2B2\` ) ).
DATA(tab2)¬†¬†= VALUE #(
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†BASE base2
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†( col1 = 'A1' col2 = 'B1' col3 = 'C1' )
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†( col1 = 'A2' col2 = 'B2' col3 = 'C2' ) ).
DATA(tab3) = VALUE itab2( BASE base1
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ( col1 = 'A1' col2 = 'B1' col3 = 'C1' )
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ( col1 = 'A2' col2 = 'B2' col3 = 'C2' ) ).
cl\_demo\_output=>write(¬†¬† tab1¬†¬†).
cl\_demo\_output=>write(¬†¬† tab2 ).
cl\_demo\_output=>display( tab3 ).

Example

Use of BASE to append lines to existing lines in an internal table.

TYPES itab TYPE TABLE OF string WITH EMPTY KEY.
DATA(itab) =
¬†¬†VALUE itab(
¬†¬†¬†¬†( \`a\` ) ( \`b\` ) ( \`c\` ) ).
...
itab =
¬†¬†VALUE #(
¬†¬†¬†¬†BASE itab
¬†¬†¬†¬†( \`d\` ) ( \`e\` ) ( \`f\` ) ).
cl\_demo\_output=>display( itab ).

Example

Use of BASE to append lines to an internal table in a loop. After the output, it is shown how the same function can be applied using an iteration expression with [FOR](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenfor_conditional.htm).

DATA itab TYPE TABLE OF i WITH EMPTY KEY.
DO 10 TIMES.
¬†¬†itab = VALUE #( BASE itab ( ipow( base = sy-index exp = 2 ) ) ).
ENDDO.
cl\_demo\_output=>display( itab ).
DATA jtab LIKE itab.
jtab = VALUE #( FOR j = 1 UNTIL j > 10
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†( ipow( base = j exp = 2 ) ) ).
ASSERT jtab = itab.

Addition 2

... FOR for\_exp

Effect

The specification of one or more consecutive [iteration expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeniteration_expression_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") using [FOR](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenfor.htm), this means that the lines constructed in [line\_spec](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenvalue_constructor_params_lspc.htm) for each iteration of the last FOR expression are inserted into the target table. When constructing table lines in [line\_spec](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenvalue_constructor_params_lspc.htm), the visible local work areas and field symbols of the iteration expressions can be used to construct the table lines.

-   If [conditional iterations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenfor_conditional.htm) are used, the new table lines are created in freely definable iteration steps.

-   If [table iterations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenfor_itab.htm) are used, the lines of existing internal tables are evaluated. In this case, these are known as [table comprehensions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abentable_comprehension_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), since new table lines are constructed from the lines of existing internal tables.

Hints

-   The term "table comprehension" is derived from similar concepts used in many other languages, where it is also referred to as "list comprehension".

-   [Table filtering](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abentable_filtering_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") can be achieved more efficiently using the [filter operator](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenfilter_operator_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [FILTER](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconstructor_expression_filter.htm).

-   Conditional iterations and table comprehensions are also possible with [FOR expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenmesh_for.htm) for [mesh paths](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenmesh_path_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

-   For tasks that can be solved using both table comprehensions and [special assignments](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencorresponding.htm) for components, in particular the component operator [CORRESPONDING](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconstructor_expr_corresponding.htm), it is best to use assignments (see the [executable example](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencorresponding_vs_for_abexa.htm)).

-   If the VALUE operator is used, it should be noted that assignments to internal tables are also initialized or assigned the content of itab after BASE even in the case of table comprehensions after the evaluation of a [LET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abaplet.htm) expressions and the target table is then used directly. The original table can therefore not be used directly in the FOR expressions, unless it is assigned to a helper variable after LET.

Example

Construction of a temporary internal table with an elementary line type and filling it with square numbers using an iteration expression.

TYPES t\_itab TYPE TABLE OF i WITH EMPTY KEY.
cl\_demo\_output=>display(
¬†¬†VALUE t\_itab( FOR i = 1 UNTIL i > 10
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†( ipow( base = i exp = 2 ) ) ) ).

VALUE, line\_spec

Syntax

... line
¬†¬†*|* *{*LINES OF itab *\[*FROM idx1*\]* *\[*TO idx2*\]* *\[*USING KEY keyname*\]**}* ...

Alternatives:

[1\. ... line](#!ABAP_ALTERNATIVE_1@1@)
[2\. ... LINES OF jtab *\[*FROM idx1*\]* *\[*TO idx2*\]* *\[*USING KEY keyname*\]*](#!ABAP_ALTERNATIVE_2@2@)

Effect

Specification of one or more lines to be inserted when constructing an internal table with the value operator [VALUE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenvalue_constructor_params_itab.htm).

Hint

If lines from the target table or the entire target table are used in line\_spec in an assignment of a constructor expression using the value operator [VALUE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenvalue_constructor_params_itab.htm) to an internal table, these lines are deleted or overwritten with a start value before both variants of line\_spec are evaluated. The target table must therefore be saved in an auxiliary variable first, for which a [LET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abaplet.htm) expression can be used.

Alternative 1

... line

Effect

Specification of a line. For line, the exact same specifications can be made as in the parentheses of an expression [NEW line\_type( ... )](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconstructor_expression_new.htm), where line\_type is the line type of the internal table and a corresponding line is constructed. The following special features apply here:

-   If a data object is specified for line, this object must be compatible with the line type.

-   If an expression (built-in function, functional method, calculation expression, constructor expression, or table expression) is specified for line, the result of the expression must be convertible to the line type.

-   The syntax does not allow further parentheses for constructing tabular line types to be nested directly in line.

Short Form for Structured Line Types

If the line type of the internal table is a structured type, the following short form can be used:

VALUE dtype*|*#( *\[*let\_exp*\]*
¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† *\[*BASE itab*\]*
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† col1 = dobj11 ... ( col2 = dobj12 col3 = dobj13 ... )
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ( col2 = dobj22 col3 = dobj23 ... )
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ...
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† col1 = dobj31 col2 = dobj32 ... ( col3 = dobj33 ... )
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ( col3 = dobj43 ... )
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ... ).

This has the same semantics as the following:

VALUE dtype*|*#( *\[*let\_exp*\]*
¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† *\[*BASE itab*\]*
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ( col1 = dobj11 ... col2 = dobj12 col3 = dobj13 ... )
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ( col1 = dobj11 ... col2 = dobj22 col3 = dobj23 ... )
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ...
¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ( col1 = dobj31 col2 = dobj32 ... col3 = dobj33 ... )
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ( col1 = dobj31 col2 = dobj32 ... col3 = dobj43 ... )
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ... ).

Values can be assigned to individual structure components outside of the inner parentheses. An assignment of this type applies to all subsequent inner parentheses until the next assignment is made to the corresponding component. Assignments outside of the inner parentheses must be followed by at least one inner parenthesis. Since a component cannot be assigned a value more than once in the [construction of a structure](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abennew_constructor_params_struct.htm), a component that has been assigned a value outside of the inner parentheses can no longer be listed in an inner parenthesis. A component can be listed again outside the inner parentheses and any components previously listed in an inner parenthesis can also be listed outside the parenthesis.

Hints

-   The restriction that the content of tabular line types cannot be constructed directly in line applies for reasons of legibility (for humans and for machines) and is not a functional restriction. The expression [VALUE line\_type( ... )](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconstructor_expression_value.htm) can be specified for line to construct the content of a tabular line, where line\_type is the tabular line type.

-   By specifying [CONV line\_type( ... )](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconstructor_expression_conv.htm) for the values to be inserted, the compatibility requirement for the line type can be met.

-   The short form for structured line types enables columns of internal tables that are to contain an identical value in blocks to be filled more easily.

-   In VALUE, the table lines are constructed in accordance with the rules for the instance operator [NEW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconstructor_expression_new.htm), since new table lines are created here and the restriction for VALUE dictating that no values of elementary data objects can be constructed cannot be applied.
    

Example

Construction of a [ranges table](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenranges_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and filling it with four lines while using the short form for structured line types.

DATA itab TYPE RANGE OF i.
itab = VALUE #( sign = 'I'¬†¬†option = 'BT' ( low = 1¬†¬†high = 10 )
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†( low = 21 high = 30 )
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†( low = 41 high = 50 )
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†option = 'GE' ( low = 61 )¬†¬†).

Alternative 2

... LINES OF jtab *\[*FROM idx1*\]* *\[*TO idx2*\]* *\[*USING KEY keyname*\]*

Effect

Specification of multiple lines. The lines are taken from the internal table jtab and inserted into the target table as a block. The same applies to jtab and the additions FROM, TO, and USING KEY as to the addition [LINES OF](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapinsert_itab_linespec.htm) of the statement [INSERT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapinsert_itab.htm) and the block is inserted in accordance with these rules. jtab is a [functional operand position](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenfunctional_position_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Hints

-   Since the lines from jtab are inserted into the target table using only the table key, jtab must be compatible with the target type.

-   If there is a conflict with an existing unique table key, an uncatchable exception is always raised when inserting multiple lines from an internal table using the statement [INSERT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapinsert_itab.htm).

-   When standard tables are created, the lines of the table jtab are appended to the target table in the same way as with the statement [APPEND LINES OF](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapappend_linespec.htm).
    

Example

Construction of an internal table with an elementary line type. jtab is filled with three lines and itab with six lines. The first line inserted in itab is initial and the last three lines are taken from the table jtab filled previously.

TYPES t\_itab TYPE TABLE OF i WITH EMPTY KEY.
DATA(jtab) = VALUE t\_itab( ( 10 ) ( 20 ) ( 30 ) ).
DATA(itab) = VALUE t\_itab( ( ) ( 1 ) ( 2 ) ( LINES OF jtab ) ).
cl\_demo\_output=>display( itab ).

Description

The example shows various effects when using the left side of an assignment in line specifications of the operator VALUE in the construction of internal tables.

-   In the construction of itab1, the left side is used after BASE. Here, it is passed the original three lines as a start value before the line specifications are evaluated. Two single lines are then appended to this start value.

-   In the construction of itab2, the left side is initialized before the line specifications are evaluated. This is why no lines are inserted by LINES OF itab2 and the table contains only two single lines.

-   In the construction of itab3, the left side is given its original three lines as a start line using BASE. They are then appended again using LINES OF, before the two single lines are appended.

-   In the construction of itab4, the left side is saved in the helper variable x before it is initialization and is then used in LINES OF. The result is the same as when the left side is used after BASE.

VALUE, Operator with LET for Internal Tables

This example demonstrates the value operator [VALUE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenvalue_constructor_params_itab.htm) for internal tables with a [LET expression](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abaplet.htm).

Description

Construction of an internal table with an elementary line type with type string and filling it with three lines. The result is a table that contains the previous day, today, and the next day in the formatting for the current language environment. Today's date is produced using a method. To make sure that the method is called only once, the return value is assigned to a local helper field in a [LET expression](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abaplet.htm).

Additions:

[1\. ... BASE itab](#!ABAP_ADDITION_1@1@)
[2\. ... FOR for\_exp](#!ABAP_ADDITION_2@2@)

Effect

If dtype is a tabular data type or # stands for such a type, the table lines of the constructed table are created as follows:

-   The first option is to list a LET expression [let\_exp](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abaplet.htm) to define local helper fields whose values can be used to construct the table lines.

-   An optional start value for the content can then be specified for the content of the internal table after BASE (see below).

-   One or more optional consecutive [iteration expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeniteration_expression_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") can then be specified using [FOR](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenfor.htm) (see below).

-   The table lines are then constructed in one or more sets of internal parentheses by specifying [line\_spec](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenvalue_constructor_params_lspc.htm). Each set of inner parentheses constructs one or more lines in accordance with the information in line\_spec and inserts them into the created internal table in accordance with the rules for the statement [INSERT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapinsert_itab.htm) ... [INTO TABLE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapinsert_itab_position.htm), with one difference: Any conflicts with an existing unique primary table key raise an exception of the class CX\_SY\_ITAB\_DUPLICATE\_KEY. The object is inserted in the order of the parentheses.

The constructed lines must meet the requirements of the statement [INSERT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapinsert_itab.htm) for inserting work areas using table keys and therefore be compatible with the line type, with one exception: when constructing a [standard table](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenstandard_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") where the lines are only appended anyway, the value can be shorter than the line length for line types c and x and then padded on the right with blanks or hexadecimal 0.

If the VALUE operator is used as the source of an assignment to an internal table, it is first initialized after the evaluation of a possible [LET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abaplet.htm) expression or is assigned the content of itab. Then, [line\_spec](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenvalue_constructor_params_lspc.htm) data is then evaluated and inserted directly into the target table.

Hints

-   In assignments of constructor expressions to an internal table, its existing lines cannot be used directly as an argument in [line\_spec](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenvalue_constructor_params_lspc.htm). This is because this table is deleted before line\_spec is evaluated or overwritten by the content of itab. If the entire internal table or lines from the left side are needed on the right side, however, they can be saved in local helper variables using a [LET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abaplet.htm) expression, since this expression is evaluated first.

-   The operand type for [line\_spec](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenvalue_constructor_params_lspc.htm) in the inner parentheses is the line type of the table type specified using dtype or #, which means it is always uniquely identifiable. Constructor expressions at this position can therefore always derive the required data type using #.
    

Example

Construction of an internal table with a structured line type and filling it with two lines. The structures are filled with values component by component.

TYPES: BEGIN OF t\_struct,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† col1 TYPE i,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† col2 TYPE i,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† END OF t\_struct,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† t\_itab TYPE TABLE OF t\_struct WITH EMPTY KEY.
DATA itab TYPE t\_itab.
itab = VALUE #( ( col1 = 1 col2 = 2 )
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†( col1 = 3 col2 = 4 ) ).

Example

Construction of an internal table with a tabular line type and filling it with two lines. The first line is assigned a table that is already filled. The second line is constructed using VALUE.

TYPES: t\_itab1 TYPE TABLE OF i¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† WITH EMPTY KEY,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† t\_itab2 TYPE TABLE OF t\_itab1 WITH EMPTY KEY.
DATA itab1 TYPE t\_itab1.
DATA itab2 TYPE t\_itab2.
itab1 = VALUE #( ( 1 ) ( 2 ) ( 3 ) ).
itab2 = VALUE #( ( itab1 )
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ( VALUE t\_itab1( ( 4 ) ( 5 ) ( 6 ) ) ) ).

Addition 1

... BASE itab

Effect

An addition, BASE, followed by an internal table, itab, can be specified in front of the specification of lines to be inserted, which is a [functional operand position](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenfunctional_position_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The line type of itab must be convertible to the line type of the return value. If BASE is specified, the content of itab is assigned to the return value before the individual lines are inserted. If the character # is specified for the type of the return value and the type cannot be determined from the operand position of the constructor expression, the type of itab is used for this expression if it is known.

Hints

-   Without the addition BASE, the content of tables can only be reconstructed using the value operator, but not extended. If the same table is specified after BASE to which the constructor expression is assigned, further lines can be inserted in this table.

-   If the target table is specified as itab after BASE in an assignment to an existing internal table, there is no assignment before [line\_spec](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenvalue_constructor_params_lspc.htm) is evaluated, but the target table simply keeps its value instead.
    

Example

Use of BASE. The table type of base1 or base2 is transferred in the construction of tab1 and tab2. This is not possible in the construction of tab3 since the line type of base2 is not structured and hence does not match the specification of individual components in the following parentheses. The type itab2 is specified explicitly for tab3. This is possible since the line type of base2 can be converted into this line type. Since sorted tables are constructed, the lines in the results are also sorted.

TYPES:
¬†¬†itab1 TYPE SORTED TABLE OF string WITH UNIQUE KEY table\_line,
¬†¬†BEGIN OF struct,
¬†¬†¬†¬†col1 TYPE c LENGTH 2,
¬†¬†¬†¬†col2 TYPE c LENGTH 2,
¬†¬†¬†¬†col3 TYPE c LENGTH 2,
¬†¬†END OF struct,
¬†¬†itab2 TYPE SORTED TABLE OF struct WITH UNIQUE KEY col1 col2 col3.
DATA(base1) = VALUE itab1(
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†( \`x1y1z1\` )
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†( \`x2y2z2\` )
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†( \`x3y3z3\` ) ).
DATA(base2) = VALUE itab2(
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†( col1 = 'x1' col2 = 'y1' col3 = 'z1' )
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†( col1 = 'x2' col2 = 'y2' col3 = 'z2' )
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†( col1 = 'x3' col2 = 'y3' col3 = 'z3' ) ).
DATA(tab1) = VALUE #( BASE base1
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ( \`A1B1B1\` )
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ( \`A2B2B2\` ) ).
DATA(tab2)¬†¬†= VALUE #(
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†BASE base2
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†( col1 = 'A1' col2 = 'B1' col3 = 'C1' )
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†( col1 = 'A2' col2 = 'B2' col3 = 'C2' ) ).
DATA(tab3) = VALUE itab2( BASE base1
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ( col1 = 'A1' col2 = 'B1' col3 = 'C1' )
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ( col1 = 'A2' col2 = 'B2' col3 = 'C2' ) ).
cl\_demo\_output=>write(¬†¬† tab1¬†¬†).
cl\_demo\_output=>write(¬†¬† tab2 ).
cl\_demo\_output=>display( tab3 ).

Example

Use of BASE to append lines to existing lines in an internal table.

TYPES itab TYPE TABLE OF string WITH EMPTY KEY.
DATA(itab) =
¬†¬†VALUE itab(
¬†¬†¬†¬†( \`a\` ) ( \`b\` ) ( \`c\` ) ).
...
itab =
¬†¬†VALUE #(
¬†¬†¬†¬†BASE itab
¬†¬†¬†¬†( \`d\` ) ( \`e\` ) ( \`f\` ) ).
cl\_demo\_output=>display( itab ).

Example

Use of BASE to append lines to an internal table in a loop. After the output, it is shown how the same function can be applied using an iteration expression with [FOR](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenfor_conditional.htm).

DATA itab TYPE TABLE OF i WITH EMPTY KEY.
DO 10 TIMES.
¬†¬†itab = VALUE #( BASE itab ( ipow( base = sy-index exp = 2 ) ) ).
ENDDO.
cl\_demo\_output=>display( itab ).
DATA jtab LIKE itab.
jtab = VALUE #( FOR j = 1 UNTIL j > 10
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†( ipow( base = j exp = 2 ) ) ).
ASSERT jtab = itab.

Addition 2

... FOR for\_exp

Effect

The specification of one or more consecutive [iteration expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeniteration_expression_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") using [FOR](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenfor.htm), this means that the lines constructed in [line\_spec](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenvalue_constructor_params_lspc.htm) for each iteration of the last FOR expression are inserted into the target table. When constructing table lines in [line\_spec](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenvalue_constructor_params_lspc.htm), the visible local work areas and field symbols of the iteration expressions can be used to construct the table lines.

-   If [conditional iterations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenfor_conditional.htm) are used, the new table lines are created in freely definable iteration steps.

-   If [table iterations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenfor_itab.htm) are used, the lines of existing internal tables are evaluated. In this case, these are known as [table comprehensions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abentable_comprehension_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), since new table lines are constructed from the lines of existing internal tables.

Hints

-   The term "table comprehension" is derived from similar concepts used in many other languages, where it is also referred to as "list comprehension".

-   [Table filtering](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abentable_filtering_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") can be achieved more efficiently using the [filter operator](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenfilter_operator_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [FILTER](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconstructor_expression_filter.htm).

-   Conditional iterations and table comprehensions are also possible with [FOR expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenmesh_for.htm) for [mesh paths](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenmesh_path_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

-   For tasks that can be solved using both table comprehensions and [special assignments](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencorresponding.htm) for components, in particular the component operator [CORRESPONDING](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconstructor_expr_corresponding.htm), it is best to use assignments (see the [executable example](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencorresponding_vs_for_abexa.htm)).

-   If the VALUE operator is used, it should be noted that assignments to internal tables are also initialized or assigned the content of itab after BASE even in the case of table comprehensions after the evaluation of a [LET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abaplet.htm) expressions and the target table is then used directly. The original table can therefore not be used directly in the FOR expressions, unless it is assigned to a helper variable after LET.

Example

Construction of a temporary internal table with an elementary line type and filling it with square numbers using an iteration expression.

TYPES t\_itab TYPE TABLE OF i WITH EMPTY KEY.
cl\_demo\_output=>display(
¬†¬†VALUE t\_itab( FOR i = 1 UNTIL i > 10
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†( ipow( base = i exp = 2 ) ) ) ).

[2\. ... LINES OF jtab *\[*FROM idx1*\]* *\[*TO idx2*\]* *\[*USING KEY keyname*\]*](#!ABAP_ALTERNATIVE_2@2@)

Effect

Specification of one or more lines to be inserted when constructing an internal table with the value operator [VALUE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenvalue_constructor_params_itab.htm).

Hint

If lines from the target table or the entire target table are used in line\_spec in an assignment of a constructor expression using the value operator [VALUE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenvalue_constructor_params_itab.htm) to an internal table, these lines are deleted or overwritten with a start value before both variants of line\_spec are evaluated. The target table must therefore be saved in an auxiliary variable first, for which a [LET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abaplet.htm) expression can be used.

Alternative 1

... line

Effect

Specification of a line. For line, the exact same specifications can be made as in the parentheses of an expression [NEW line\_type( ... )](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconstructor_expression_new.htm), where line\_type is the line type of the internal table and a corresponding line is constructed. The following special features apply here:

-   If a data object is specified for line, this object must be compatible with the line type.

-   If an expression (built-in function, functional method, calculation expression, constructor expression, or table expression) is specified for line, the result of the expression must be convertible to the line type.

-   The syntax does not allow further parentheses for constructing tabular line types to be nested directly in line.

Short Form for Structured Line Types

If the line type of the internal table is a structured type, the following short form can be used:

VALUE dtype*|*#( *\[*let\_exp*\]*
¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† *\[*BASE itab*\]*
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† col1 = dobj11 ... ( col2 = dobj12 col3 = dobj13 ... )
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ( col2 = dobj22 col3 = dobj23 ... )
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ...
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† col1 = dobj31 col2 = dobj32 ... ( col3 = dobj33 ... )
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ( col3 = dobj43 ... )
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ... ).

This has the same semantics as the following:

VALUE dtype*|*#( *\[*let\_exp*\]*
¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† *\[*BASE itab*\]*
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ( col1 = dobj11 ... col2 = dobj12 col3 = dobj13 ... )
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ( col1 = dobj11 ... col2 = dobj22 col3 = dobj23 ... )
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ...
¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ( col1 = dobj31 col2 = dobj32 ... col3 = dobj33 ... )
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ( col1 = dobj31 col2 = dobj32 ... col3 = dobj43 ... )
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ... ).

Values can be assigned to individual structure components outside of the inner parentheses. An assignment of this type applies to all subsequent inner parentheses until the next assignment is made to the corresponding component. Assignments outside of the inner parentheses must be followed by at least one inner parenthesis. Since a component cannot be assigned a value more than once in the [construction of a structure](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abennew_constructor_params_struct.htm), a component that has been assigned a value outside of the inner parentheses can no longer be listed in an inner parenthesis. A component can be listed again outside the inner parentheses and any components previously listed in an inner parenthesis can also be listed outside the parenthesis.

Hints

-   The restriction that the content of tabular line types cannot be constructed directly in line applies for reasons of legibility (for humans and for machines) and is not a functional restriction. The expression [VALUE line\_type( ... )](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconstructor_expression_value.htm) can be specified for line to construct the content of a tabular line, where line\_type is the tabular line type.

-   By specifying [CONV line\_type( ... )](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconstructor_expression_conv.htm) for the values to be inserted, the compatibility requirement for the line type can be met.

-   The short form for structured line types enables columns of internal tables that are to contain an identical value in blocks to be filled more easily.

-   In VALUE, the table lines are constructed in accordance with the rules for the instance operator [NEW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconstructor_expression_new.htm), since new table lines are created here and the restriction for VALUE dictating that no values of elementary data objects can be constructed cannot be applied.
    

Example

Construction of a [ranges table](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenranges_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and filling it with four lines while using the short form for structured line types.

DATA itab TYPE RANGE OF i.
itab = VALUE #( sign = 'I'¬†¬†option = 'BT' ( low = 1¬†¬†high = 10 )
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†( low = 21 high = 30 )
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†( low = 41 high = 50 )
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†option = 'GE' ( low = 61 )¬†¬†).

Alternative 2

... LINES OF jtab *\[*FROM idx1*\]* *\[*TO idx2*\]* *\[*USING KEY keyname*\]*

Effect

Specification of multiple lines. The lines are taken from the internal table jtab and inserted into the target table as a block. The same applies to jtab and the additions FROM, TO, and USING KEY as to the addition [LINES OF](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapinsert_itab_linespec.htm) of the statement [INSERT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapinsert_itab.htm) and the block is inserted in accordance with these rules. jtab is a [functional operand position](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenfunctional_position_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Hints

-   Since the lines from jtab are inserted into the target table using only the table key, jtab must be compatible with the target type.

-   If there is a conflict with an existing unique table key, an uncatchable exception is always raised when inserting multiple lines from an internal table using the statement [INSERT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapinsert_itab.htm).

-   When standard tables are created, the lines of the table jtab are appended to the target table in the same way as with the statement [APPEND LINES OF](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapappend_linespec.htm).
    

Example

Construction of an internal table with an elementary line type. jtab is filled with three lines and itab with six lines. The first line inserted in itab is initial and the last three lines are taken from the table jtab filled previously.

TYPES t\_itab TYPE TABLE OF i WITH EMPTY KEY.
DATA(jtab) = VALUE t\_itab( ( 10 ) ( 20 ) ( 30 ) ).
DATA(itab) = VALUE t\_itab( ( ) ( 1 ) ( 2 ) ( LINES OF jtab ) ).

Description

The example shows various effects when using the left side of an assignment in line specifications of the operator VALUE in the construction of internal tables.

-   In the construction of itab1, the left side is used after BASE. Here, it is passed the original three lines as a start value before the line specifications are evaluated. Two single lines are then appended to this start value.

-   In the construction of itab2, the left side is initialized before the line specifications are evaluated. This is why no lines are inserted by LINES OF itab2 and the table contains only two single lines.

-   In the construction of itab3, the left side is given its original three lines as a start line using BASE. They are then appended again using LINES OF, before the two single lines are appended.

-   In the construction of itab4, the left side is saved in the helper variable x before it is initialization and is then used in LINES OF. The result is the same as when the left side is used after BASE.

Shared Objects - IF\_SHM\_BUILD\_INSTANCE

The interface IF\_SHM\_BUILD\_INSTANCE must be included by an [area constructor class](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenshm_area_constructor_class.htm) that implements the optional area constructor of an area.

Static Methods

BUILD

Interface method for implementing the area constructor of an area.

Input Parameters

-   INST\_NAME of type SHM\_INST\_NAME

Name of the area instance version. Specifying the name is optional. The default value is the value of the constant CL\_SHM\_AREA=>DEFAULT\_INSTANCE.

-   INVOCATION\_MODE of type i

This parameter can be used to determine the type of call in the area constructor. The default value CL\_SHM\_AREA=>INVOCATION\_MODE\_EXPLICIT is used for the explicit call. CL\_SHM\_AREA=>INVOCATION\_MODE\_AUTO\_BUILD is passed with the automatic call.

Exceptions

-   CX\_SHM\_BUILD\_FAILED

An error occurred when the area constructor was executed.

Note

The method BUILD does not have an input parameter for the client ID. The area is built in the current client when the method is called.

Shared Objects - Area Constructor Class

An area constructor class is a global class with a freely selectable name that implements the interface [IF\_SHM\_BUILD\_INSTANCE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenshm_if_shm_build_instance.htm). An area constructor can be implemented in the interface method BUILD.

An area constructor class can be [assigned](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenshm_area_dynamic_properties.htm) to an [area](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenshm_areas.htm) in transaction SHMA. This is always necessary if the area is to be built automatically by calling the area constructor, that is, if the components BUILD\_KIND and REFRESH\_TIME of the structure PROPERTIES of the class [CL\_SHM\_AREA](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenshm_cl_shm_area.htm) are filled accordingly. If an area is not built automatically, an area constructor class can be specified for the explicit area constructor call using the method BUILD of the [area class](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenshm_area_class.htm).

Structure of an Area Constructor

The following structure is recommended for the area constructor implemented in the interface method BUILD:

1.  First, the area constructor must use the method ATTACH\_FOR\_WRITE to create an area handle with a write lock for the area instance passed in the parameter INST\_NAME. Since the automatically created area constructor cannot be used to ensure that the write lock can be set, all exceptions must be caught and forwarded to the caller of the constructor by raising the interface exception CX\_SHM\_BUILD\_FAILED. The original exception should be passed to the parameter PREVIOUS of the constructor of CX\_SHM\_BUILD\_FAILED.
    
2.  As with every creation of a new area instance version, a root object must also be defined in the area constructor using the method SET\_ROOT.
    
3.  The area instance version can then be built, which means that objects are stored in the shared memory.
    
4.  The created area handle has to be released again using the method DETACH\_COMMIT. If an exception is raised, it is usually a programming error and should not be handled in the area constructor.
    
5.  If the area constructor was called automatically, a database commit must be triggered when a transactional area is built.
    

In an area constructor, no statements can be used that exit the current [internal session](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeninternal_session_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") (such as SUBMIT, CALL TRANSACTION, CALL SCREEN, MESSAGE for message types "W", "I", "E", and so on).

Example

The following implementation can be used as a template for personal implementations.

CLASS area\_constructor IMPLEMENTATION.
¬†¬†METHOD if\_shm\_build\_instance~build.
¬†¬†¬†¬†DATA:
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†my\_handle TYPE REF TO area,

Shared Objects - IF\_SHM\_BUILD\_INSTANCE

The interface IF\_SHM\_BUILD\_INSTANCE must be included by an [area constructor class](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenshm_area_constructor_class.htm) that implements the optional area constructor of an area.

Static Methods

BUILD

Interface method for implementing the area constructor of an area.

Input Parameters

-   INST\_NAME of type SHM\_INST\_NAME

Name of the area instance version. Specifying the name is optional. The default value is the value of the constant CL\_SHM\_AREA=>DEFAULT\_INSTANCE.

-   INVOCATION\_MODE of type i

This parameter can be used to determine the type of call in the area constructor. The default value CL\_SHM\_AREA=>INVOCATION\_MODE\_EXPLICIT is used for the explicit call. CL\_SHM\_AREA=>INVOCATION\_MODE\_AUTO\_BUILD is passed with the automatic call.

Exceptions

-   CX\_SHM\_BUILD\_FAILED

An error occurred when the area constructor was executed.

Note

The method BUILD does not have an input parameter for the client ID. The area is built in the current client when the method is called.

Shared Objects - Area Constructor Class

An area constructor class is a global class with a freely selectable name that implements the interface [IF\_SHM\_BUILD\_INSTANCE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenshm_if_shm_build_instance.htm). An area constructor can be implemented in the interface method BUILD.

An area constructor class can be [assigned](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenshm_area_dynamic_properties.htm) to an [area](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenshm_areas.htm) in transaction SHMA. This is always necessary if the area is to be built automatically by calling the area constructor, that is, if the components BUILD\_KIND and REFRESH\_TIME of the structure PROPERTIES of the class [CL\_SHM\_AREA](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenshm_cl_shm_area.htm) are filled accordingly. If an area is not built automatically, an area constructor class can be specified for the explicit area constructor call using the method BUILD of the [area class](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenshm_area_class.htm).

Structure of an Area Constructor

The following structure is recommended for the area constructor implemented in the interface method BUILD:

1.  First, the area constructor must use the method ATTACH\_FOR\_WRITE to create an area handle with a write lock for the area instance passed in the parameter INST\_NAME. Since the automatically created area constructor cannot be used to ensure that the write lock can be set, all exceptions must be caught and forwarded to the caller of the constructor by raising the interface exception CX\_SHM\_BUILD\_FAILED. The original exception should be passed to the parameter PREVIOUS of the constructor of CX\_SHM\_BUILD\_FAILED.
    
2.  As with every creation of a new area instance version, a root object must also be defined in the area constructor using the method SET\_ROOT.
    
3.  The area instance version can then be built, which means that objects are stored in the shared memory.
    
4.  The created area handle has to be released again using the method DETACH\_COMMIT. If an exception is raised, it is usually a programming error and should not be handled in the area constructor.
    
5.  If the area constructor was called automatically, a database commit must be triggered when a transactional area is built.
    

In an area constructor, no statements can be used that exit the current [internal session](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeninternal_session_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") (such as SUBMIT, CALL TRANSACTION, CALL SCREEN, MESSAGE for message types "W", "I", "E", and so on).

Example

The following implementation can be used as a template for personal implementations.

CLASS area\_constructor IMPLEMENTATION.
¬†¬†METHOD if\_shm\_build\_instance~build.
¬†¬†¬†¬†DATA:
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†my\_handle TYPE REF TO area,

Shared Objects - IF\_SHM\_BUILD\_INSTANCE

The interface IF\_SHM\_BUILD\_INSTANCE must be included by an [area constructor class](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenshm_area_constructor_class.htm) that implements the optional area constructor of an area.

Static Methods

BUILD

Interface method for implementing the area constructor of an area.

Input Parameters

-   INST\_NAME of type SHM\_INST\_NAME

Name of the area instance version. Specifying the name is optional. The default value is the value of the constant CL\_SHM\_AREA=>DEFAULT\_INSTANCE.

-   INVOCATION\_MODE of type i

This parameter can be used to determine the type of call in the area constructor. The default value CL\_SHM\_AREA=>INVOCATION\_MODE\_EXPLICIT is used for the explicit call. CL\_SHM\_AREA=>INVOCATION\_MODE\_AUTO\_BUILD is passed with the automatic call.

Exceptions

-   CX\_SHM\_BUILD\_FAILED

An error occurred when the area constructor was executed.

Note

The method BUILD does not have an input parameter for the client ID. The area is built in the current client when the method is called.

Shared Objects - Area Constructor Class

An area constructor class is a global class with a freely selectable name that implements the interface [IF\_SHM\_BUILD\_INSTANCE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenshm_if_shm_build_instance.htm). An area constructor can be implemented in the interface method BUILD.

An area constructor class can be [assigned](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenshm_area_dynamic_properties.htm) to an [area](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenshm_areas.htm) in transaction SHMA. This is always necessary if the area is to be built automatically by calling the area constructor, that is, if the components BUILD\_KIND and REFRESH\_TIME of the structure PROPERTIES of the class [CL\_SHM\_AREA](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenshm_cl_shm_area.htm) are filled accordingly. If an area is not built automatically, an area constructor class can be specified for the explicit area constructor call using the method BUILD of the [area class](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenshm_area_class.htm).

Structure of an Area Constructor

The following structure is recommended for the area constructor implemented in the interface method BUILD:

1.  First, the area constructor must use the method ATTACH\_FOR\_WRITE to create an area handle with a write lock for the area instance passed in the parameter INST\_NAME. Since the automatically created area constructor cannot be used to ensure that the write lock can be set, all exceptions must be caught and forwarded to the caller of the constructor by raising the interface exception CX\_SHM\_BUILD\_FAILED. The original exception should be passed to the parameter PREVIOUS of the constructor of CX\_SHM\_BUILD\_FAILED.
    
2.  As with every creation of a new area instance version, a root object must also be defined in the area constructor using the method SET\_ROOT.
    
3.  The area instance version can then be built, which means that objects are stored in the shared memory.
    
4.  The created area handle has to be released again using the method DETACH\_COMMIT. If an exception is raised, it is usually a programming error and should not be handled in the area constructor.
    
5.  If the area constructor was called automatically, a database commit must be triggered when a transactional area is built.
    

In an area constructor, no statements can be used that exit the current [internal session](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeninternal_session_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") (such as SUBMIT, CALL TRANSACTION, CALL SCREEN, MESSAGE for message types "W", "I", "E", and so on).

Example

The following implementation can be used as a template for personal implementations.

CLASS area\_constructor IMPLEMENTATION.
¬†¬†METHOD if\_shm\_build\_instance~build.
¬†¬†¬†¬†DATA:
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†my\_handle TYPE REF TO area,

SPA/GPA Parameters in the User Memory

The [user memory](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenuser_memory_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is a user-specific [memory area](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenmemory_organization.htm) of the current [AS instance](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenapplication_server_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), which can be accessed by all [ABAP sessions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_session_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of a user session simultaneously. ABAP programs have access to SPA/GPA parameters stored in the user memory (also referred to as SET/GET parameters).

-   [Properties of SPA/GPA parameters](#abenspa-gpa-1--------spa-gpa-parameters-and-abap-programs---@ITOC@@ABENSPA_GPA_2)

-   [Managing SPA/GPA Parameters](#abenspa-gpa-3--------spa-gpa-parameters-and-dynpro-fields---@ITOC@@ABENSPA_GPA_4)

Properties of SPA/GPA parameters

Each SPA/GPA parameter is identified by an ID of up to 20 characters. SPA/GPA parameters can either be created explicitly using the statement [SET PARAMETER](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapset_parameter.htm), or implicitly in a [PAI](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenpai_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") event and are available to any programs and any sessions for the whole duration of a user session after they have been saved in the user memory. SPA/GPA parameters are usually evaluated by the ABAP runtime environment. In ABAP programs, they can be read using the statement [GET PARAMETER](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapget_parameter.htm).

Example

An example of a program that uses SPA/GPA parameters is the user maintenance (transaction SU01). In this transaction, user-specific parameters can be entered on the Parameters tab page, which are then set when the user logs on to [AS ABAP](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenas_abap_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and are evaluated by other programs.

SPA/GPA Parameters and ABAP Programs

The statements [SET PARAMETER](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapset_parameter.htm) and [GET PARAMETER](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapget_parameter.htm) of a program do not directly access the SPA/GPA parameters of the user memory.

-   As soon as an ABAP program is rolled in to the memory, all SPA/GPA parameters of the user memory are copied to the [session memory](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenroll_area_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the program. The statements [SET PARAMETER](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapset_parameter.htm) and [GET PARAMETER](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapget_parameter.htm) of a program work with the local SPA/GPA parameters of the session memory.

-   As soon as a program is rolled out of the memory, all local SPA/GPA parameters are copied to the cross-session user memory, where they replace all SPA/GPA parameters. Any SPA/GPA parameters that do not exist in the session memory also do not exist in the user memory afterwards. A roll out is performed, for example:

-   When exiting a program.

-   When calling a new program using [SUBMIT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapsubmit.htm), [CALL TRANSACTION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall_transaction.htm), or [LEAVE TO TRANSACTION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapleave_to_transaction.htm).

-   During any work process change A work process is changed in the same situations that cause implicit [database commits](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendb_commit.htm).

-   In the statement [COMMIT WORK](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcommit.htm).

Hint

The fact that ABAP programs do not access the user memory directly but all SPA/GPA parameters like a file have to be imported or exported implicitly at given times, has consequences for programs that run in parallel sessions of the same user:

-   If a program sets a SPA/GPA parameter using [SET PARAMETER](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapset_parameter.htm), a program in a parallel ABAP session can only be started after the rolling program has been rolled out if it needs to access the modified parameter.

-   If a program sets a SPA/GPA parameter using [SET PARAMETER](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapset_parameter.htm) while another program in a parallel ABAP session is active, and the latter has been running longer than the setting program, these changes are overwritten when the program that has been running longer is rolled out.

Premature rollouts can be forced by statements such as [WAIT UP TO](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapwait_up_to.htm), but the fact that the state of the user memory is always determined by the program that was last rolled out creates a serious obstacle for cross-session use of SPA/GPA parameters in parallel programs. This type of programming is therefore not recommended.

Managing SPA/GPA Parameters

The names of SPA/GPA parameters are managed in the database table TPARA. In the [Object Navigator](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenobject_navigator_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the [ABAP Workbench](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_workbench_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), the names of SPA/GPA parameters are created in uppercase letters in the database table TPARA and are linked to packages. The database table TPARA acts as a reservation table for SPA/GPA parameters. If SPA/GPA parameters are used in a program, the name of the parameter must be contained in the PARAMID column in the database table TPARA. SPA/GPA parameters from other applications should not be unintentionally overwritten.

Hint

If a name exists in the database table TPARA, this does not automatically mean that the corresponding parameter also exists in the user memory. SPA/GPA parameters are created only during the execution of ABAP programs.

SPA/GPA Parameters and Dynpro Fields

When defining input fields, [dynpro fields](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendynpro_field_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") can be linked to SPA/GPA parameters by entering the name of an SPA/GPA parameter from the database table TPARA as the property PARAMETER ID. If the corresponding property GET PARAMETER is set, no other value is assigned to the input field, and the dynpro is not processed in a [batch input session](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbatch_input_session_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), the input field is filled with the value of the SPA/GPA parameter when the [screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenscreen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is sent. If the corresponding property SET PARAMETER is set, the content of the input field is assigned to the SPA/GPA parameter at the PAI event. If the parameter does not yet exist in the user memory, it is created implicitly in the PAI event. In the case of [selection screens](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenselection_screen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), the addition MEMORY ID links the statements [PARAMETERS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapparameters_value.htm) and [SELECT-OPTIONS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapselect-options_value.htm).

Hints

-   A data transport between a dynpro field and an SPA/GPA parameter in the user memory only takes place if a global data object with the same name as the dynpro field is declared in the associated ABAP program.

-   If the PAI event is raised using a function of type "E", no values are assigned to the SPA/GPA parameters linked to the dynpro and no parameters are created in the user memory.

-   The restriction that input fields are not filled with the value of SPA/GPA parameters during [batch input sessions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbatch_input_session_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is not valid for [batch input tables](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbatch_input_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") used with [CALL TRANSACTION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall_transaction_using.htm). Then, dynpro fields to which no value is assigned in the batch input table, are supplied from their SPA/GPA parameters.

SET PARAMETER

[Short Reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapset_parameter_shortref.htm)

Syntax

SET PARAMETER ID pid FIELD dobj.

Effect

This statement sets the content of the [SPA/GPA](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenspa_gpa_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") parameter specified in pid in the [user memory](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenuser_memory_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") to the content of the data object dobj. The ID pid expects a [flat](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenflat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") character-like field that can contain a maximum of 20 characters and not only blanks. pid is case-sensitive. dobj expects a flat character-like field whose binary content is passed unconverted.

The statement SET PARAMETER does not access the user memory directly. Instead, it accesses a local mapping of the SPA/GPA parameter in the [session memory](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenroll_area_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), which is loaded during rollup and saved in the user memory when rolled out (see [SPA/GPA Parameters and ABAP Programs](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenspa_gpa.htm)). If the SPA/GPA parameter specified for the current user in pid does not yet exist in the [user memory](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenuser_memory_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), it is created. If the SPA/GPA parameter already existed for the current user, its value is overwritten.

In a program, SPA/GPA parameters can only be created or filled with values that have a name in the table TPARA. If it is possible to statically determine that an ID specified pid is not in the database table TPARA, the extended program check reports an error.

Hints

-   An SPA/GPA parameter specified in pid must be entered in uppercase to match a name in the database table TPARA.

-   Since the statements SET PARAMETER and GET PARAMETER do not work directly with the SPA/GPA parameters of the user memory, they are only suitable for passing data within an [ABAP session](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_session_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and not for passing data between parallel ABAP sessions because programs that run in parallel can affect the state of the parameters in an uncontrolled manner.
    

Example

If the user selects one of the flight connections displayed in the basic list, the SPA/GPA parameters CAR and CON are set to the ID of the airline and the number of the connection at the event AT LINE-SELECTION. The names of both parameters are defined in the table TPARA for this purpose. In the initial [dynpro](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendynpro_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the transaction DEMO\_TRANSACTION, two input fields are linked to these SPA/GPA parameters and are displayed with the selected values as [start values](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenstart_value_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

DATA: carrier¬†¬†¬†¬† TYPE spfli-carrid,

The field is case-sensitive. The binary content of the SPA/GPA parameter is passed to dobj without being converted. The following can be specified for dobj:

-   An existing flat character-like variable.

-   An inline declaration [DATA(var)](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendata_inline.htm), where a variable of type XUVALUE is declared.

The statement GET PARAMETER does not access the user memory directly. Instead, it accesses a local mapping of the SPA/GPA parameter in the [session memory](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenroll_area_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), which is loaded during roll-in and saved in the user memory when rolled out (see [SPA/GPA Parameters and ABAP Programs](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenspa_gpa.htm)). If the SPA/GPA parameter specified in pid does not yet exist in the [user memory](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenuser_memory_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") for the current user, the data object dobj is initialized and sy-subrc is set to 4.

A program can only read those SPA/GPA parameters for which there is a name in the table TPARA. If it is possible to statically determine that an ID specified pid is not in the database table TPARA, the extended program check reports an error.

System Fields

sy-subrc

Meaning

0

The SPA/GPA parameter specified in pid exists for the current user in the user memory and its value was passed to the target field.

4

The SPA/GPA parameter specified in pid does not exist for the current user in the user memory.

Hints

-   An SPA/GPA parameter that can be read using GET PARAMETER can either have been created previously using the statement [SET PARAMETER](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapset_parameter.htm) or created automatically in the [PAI](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenpai_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") event of a [dynpro](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendynpro_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or [selection screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenselection_screen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in the user memory.

-   An SPA/GPA parameter specified in pid must be entered in uppercase to match a name in the database table TPARA.

-   Since the statements SET PARAMETER and GET PARAMETER do not work directly with the SPA/GPA parameters of the user memory, they are only suitable for passing data within an [ABAP session](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_session_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and not for passing data between parallel ABAP sessions because programs that run in parallel can affect the state of the parameters in an uncontrolled manner.
    

Example

In this example, the current value of the SPA/GPA parameter RID is read from the user memory to the data object prog. In the dynpros in the [ABAP Workbench](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_workbench_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), this parameter is linked to the input fields for a program name. When an ABAP Workbench tool in which an ABAP program is processed, is first called, the parameter is created in the event PAI and assigned the name of the program specified there. If, in the same user session, no dynpro was processed that sets the parameter RID and no corresponding SET PARAMETER statement was executed beforehand, RID is not found in the user memory.

DATA: para TYPE tpara-paramid VALUE 'RID',
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†prog TYPE sy-repid.
GET PARAMETER ID para FIELD prog.
IF sy-subrc <> 0.
¬†¬†MESSAGE 'Parameter not found' TYPE 'I'.
ENDIF.

Logical Functions

Logical functions are a part of [built-in functions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbuilt_in_functions.htm). They are divided into:

-   [Boolean functions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenboole_functions.htm)

-   [Predicate functions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenpredicate_functions.htm)

Hint

The program DEMO\_EXPRESSIONS shows examples of how to use logical functions.

boolc, boolx, xsdbool, Boolean Functions

Variants:

[1\. ... boolc( log\_exp ) ...](#!ABAP_VARIANT_1@1@)
[2\. ... boolx( bool = log\_exp bit = bit ) ...](#!ABAP_VARIANT_2@2@)
[3\. ... xsdbool( log\_exp ) ...](#!ABAP_VARIANT_3@3@)

Effect

The Boolean functions determine the [truth value](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abentruth_value_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of a logical expression [log\_exp](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenlogexp.htm) specified as an argument. For log\_exp, any logical expression can be specified in accordance with the applicable rules. The return value of a Boolean function has a data type dependent on the function and expresses the truth value of the logical expression with a value of this type.

Hint

These functions can be considered a partial replacement for the Boolean data type for truth values that is not available in ABAP. In particular, xsdbool and, under certain circumstances, boolc can be used in many operand positions where values of the type abap\_bool of the type pool ABAP are expected.

Variant 1

... boolc( log\_exp ) ...

Effect

The function boolc returns a single-character character string of the type string. If the logical expression is true, "X" is returned. If the logical expression is false, a blank is returned. In principle, boolc is one of the [processing functions with character-like results](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprocess_functions.htm) and can be specified in [general expression positions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abengeneral_expr_position_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and in [character-like expression positions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencharlike_expr_position_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Hints

-   If boolc requires return values other than "X" or " " (for example, "Y" and "N" or "1" and "0"), the result of boolc can be processed directly using the function [translate](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abentranslate_functions.htm) or another suitable [processing function](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprocess_functions.htm).

-   The result of boolc should not be compared with the constants abap\_true and abap\_false in relational expressions, since the latter converts from c to string and ignores any blanks. Comparisons of this type are not usually necessary. If a comparison of this type is to be executed anyway, the function xsdbool can be used instead of boolc whose result has the same ABAP type as abap\_bool.

-   If the logical expression is false, the result of boolc does not meet the condition [IS INITIAL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenlogexp_initial.htm), since a blank and no empty string is returned. If this is desired, the function xsdbool can be used instead of boolc.

-   If boolc is used in inappropriate places as specified in the points above, this leads to a syntax warning, which can be hidden using a pragma.

Example

The value 0, 1, or 2 is assigned to the variable bool\_value, depending on the result of the logical expressions log\_exp1 and log\_exp2.

DATA bool\_value TYPE i.
bool\_value = strlen( condense( val = boolc( log\_exp1 ) ) ) +
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† strlen( condense( val = boolc( log\_exp2 ) ) ).

Example

Call of a method, where the input parameter no\_dialog is supplied with the character-like representation of the results of a predicate expression.

PARAMETERS word TYPE c length 30.
DATA result\_tab TYPE cl\_abap\_docu=>search\_results.
cl\_abap\_docu=>start(
¬†¬†EXPORTING word¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† = word
¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†no\_dialog¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†= boolc( sy-batch IS NOT INITIAL )
¬†¬†IMPORTING search\_results = result\_tab ).

Variant 2

... boolx( bool = log\_exp bit = bit ) ...

Effect

The function boolx returns a byte chain of the type xstring. If the logical expression is true, the byte chain is filled as if the function [bit-set( bit )](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbit_functions.htm) were executed. If the logical expression is false, the byte chain is filled as if the function [bit-set( 0 )](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbit_functions.htm) were executed. bit expects a data object of the type i. In principle, boolx belongs to the [bit functions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbit_functions.htm) and can be used in all positions where a [bit expression](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbit_expression_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is also allowed.

Hint

The function boolx can be used for efficient storage of sequences of truth values.

Example

The result of the following [bit expression](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbit_expression_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is hexadecimal 55, which corresponds to the calculated bit string 01010101.

DATA(result) = boolx( bool = 2 > 1 bit = 8 )
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†BIT-OR boolx( bool = 2 < 1 bit = 7 )
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†BIT-OR boolx( bool = 2 > 1 bit = 6 )
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†BIT-OR boolx( bool = 2 < 1 bit = 5 )
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†BIT-OR boolx( bool = 2 > 1 bit = 4 )
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†BIT-OR boolx( bool = 2 < 1 bit = 3 )
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†BIT-OR boolx( bool = 2 > 1 bit = 2 )
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†BIT-OR boolx( bool = 2 < 1 bit = 1 ).

The bit expression above can be expressed using the following iteration with the operator [REDUCE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconstructor_expression_reduce.htm).

DATA(result) =
¬†¬†REDUCE xstring( INIT x TYPE xstring
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†FOR j = 4 THEN j - 1 UNTIL j < 1
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†LET b1 = 2 \* j b2 = 2 \* j - 2 IN
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†NEXT x = x BIT-OR boolx( bool = 2 > 1¬†¬†bit = b1 )
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† BIT-OR boolx( bool = 2 < 1¬†¬†bit = b2 ) ).

Variant 3

... xsdbool( log\_exp ) ...

Effect

Like boolc, the function xsdbool returns the value "X" for true and a blank for false. The data type of the return value, however, has the type c of the length 1 here.

The return value references the type XSDBOOLEAN from the ABAP Dictionary. This type, which refers to the identically named domain of type CHAR and length 1, is handled like a real Boolean type in serializations and deserializations to or from [asXML](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_xslt_asxml_schema.htm) and [asJSON](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_asjson_schema.htm) using [CALL TRANSFORMATION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall_transformation.htm). The XML or JSON values true and false are assigned to the values "X" and " " of this type.

xsdbool can be specified in [general](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abengeneral_expr_position_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and [character-like expression positions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencharlike_expr_position_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Hints

-   The result of xsdbool can be used like a value of the type abap\_bool and can be compared with the constants abap\_true and abap\_false without any problems.

-   If the logical expression is false, the result of boolc fulfills the condition [IS INITIAL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenlogexp_initial.htm), since the returned blank is the type-dependent initial value at the same time.

-   The result of xsdbool cannot usually be converted directly using a [processing function](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprocess_functions.htm) such as [translate](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abentranslate_functions.htm), since the trailing blanks here are ignored in text fields of type c. The result of a false logical expression would be ignored. The result of the function boolc of type string is better suited for conversions of this type.

-   The abbreviation xsd stands for [XML schema data types](http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/).

Example

This example sets the type and the value of the variable gui\_flag declared inline using the Boolean function xsdbool for whose argument a [predicative method call](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenpredicative_method_call_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is listed. The variable is then serialized to [asXML](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenasxml_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and [asJSON](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenasjson_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") using the predefined [identity transformation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenid_trafo_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [ID](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_xslt_id.htm). This produces the value true or false. After a comparison with the identically typed constant abap\_false, the formatted result of the serialization is either read or displayed.

The result would be quite different if boolc were used instead of xsdbool. First, the transformations would have a different result since the values "X" and " " are not transformed to true or false; second, the logical expression gui\_flag = abap\_false would always be false, since abap\_false loses its blank when converting to the type string.

DATA(gui\_flag) = xsdbool( cl\_demo\_sap\_gui=>check( ) ).
CALL TRANSFORMATION id SOURCE gui\_flag = gui\_flag
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† RESULT XML DATA(xml).
DATA(writer) =
¬†¬†cl\_sxml\_string\_writer=>create( type = if\_sxml=>co\_xt\_json ).
CALL TRANSFORMATION id SOURCE gui\_flag = gui\_flag
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† RESULT XML writer.
DATA(json) = writer->get\_output( ).
cl\_demo\_output=>write\_xml( xml ).
cl\_demo\_output=>write\_json( json ).
IF gui\_flag = abap\_false.
¬†¬†cl\_demo\_output=>get( ).
ELSE.
¬†¬†cl\_demo\_output=>display( ).
ENDIF.

Description

This example shows the two variants of the statement RAISE EXCEPTION. The first statement raises an exception of the class CX\_DEMO\_CONSTRUCTOR in the inner TRY block, creates the relevant object, and passes the program name to the instance constructor. The inner CATCH block handles the exception, puts out the exception text and raises the exception again without creating a new object. The outer CATCH block handles the exception again. The CX\_DEMO\_CONSTRUCTOR class is defined in such a way that the passed program name appears in the exception text. The generated instance constructor ensures this.

The output of the line number in which the exception was raised indicates that, when the existing exception object was reused, its information was changed.

Description

-   If the content of number is greater than 100, the TRY control structure of the [compilation unit](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencompilation_unit_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") raises an exception of the class CX\_DEMO\_ABS\_TOO\_LARGE in the TRY block. This exception is handled by the second CATCH block of the same TRY control structure, since the subclass of the most general exception is CX\_ROOT.

-   If the content of number is 0, the runtime environment in the TRY block of the TRY control structure of the called method calculation raises an exception of the predefined class CX\_SY\_ZERODIVIDE. This is handled in the CATCH block of the same TRY control structure.

-   If the content of number is a negative number, the runtime environment in the TRY block of the TRY control structure of the called method calculation raises an exception of the predefined class CX\_SY\_ARG\_OUT\_OF\_DOMAIN. Since no handler is defined for this exception in this TRY control structure, the exception is propagated from the method, which is made possible by the declaration of the superclass CX\_SY\_ARITHMETIC\_ERROR using RAISING in the method interface. The CLEANUP block of the inner TRY control structure is executed first.

-   Any other exceptions are handled in the final CATCH block of the TRY control structure of the compilation unit, which catches all possible exceptions by specifying the most generic exception class CX\_ROOT. If, for example, CX\_SY\_ARG\_OUT\_OF\_DOMAIN or one of its superclasses was not declared in the method interface, the exception CX\_SY\_NO\_HANDLER would be raised and would be handled in the final CATCH block.

Description

The method meth1 raises a non-resumable exception and the method meth2 raises a resumable exception that is handled in the TRY control structures of the method main using CATCH.

-   If handled without BEFORE UNWIND, the CLEANUP block is executed in both cases before handling and the context of the called method does not exist during handling.

-   If handled with BEFORE UNWIND, the context of the called method exists in both cases during handling and the CLEANUP block is executed after handling.

-   If a resumable exception is raised, the statement RESUME can be executed during handling, which ensures that processing in the called method is continued without its CLEANUP block being executed.

Description

This example shows the two variants of the statement RAISE EXCEPTION. The first statement raises an exception of the class CX\_DEMO\_CONSTRUCTOR in the inner TRY block, creates the relevant object, and passes the program name to the instance constructor. The inner CATCH block handles the exception, puts out the exception text and raises the exception again without creating a new object. The outer CATCH block handles the exception again. The CX\_DEMO\_CONSTRUCTOR class is defined in such a way that the passed program name appears in the exception text. The generated instance constructor ensures this.

The output of the line number in which the exception was raised indicates that, when the existing exception object was reused, its information was changed.

Description

-   If the content of number is greater than 100, the TRY control structure of the [compilation unit](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencompilation_unit_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") raises an exception of the class CX\_DEMO\_ABS\_TOO\_LARGE in the TRY block. This exception is handled by the second CATCH block of the same TRY control structure, since the subclass of the most general exception is CX\_ROOT.

-   If the content of number is 0, the runtime environment in the TRY block of the TRY control structure of the called method calculation raises an exception of the predefined class CX\_SY\_ZERODIVIDE. This is handled in the CATCH block of the same TRY control structure.

-   If the content of number is a negative number, the runtime environment in the TRY block of the TRY control structure of the called method calculation raises an exception of the predefined class CX\_SY\_ARG\_OUT\_OF\_DOMAIN. Since no handler is defined for this exception in this TRY control structure, the exception is propagated from the method, which is made possible by the declaration of the superclass CX\_SY\_ARITHMETIC\_ERROR using RAISING in the method interface. The CLEANUP block of the inner TRY control structure is executed first.

-   Any other exceptions are handled in the final CATCH block of the TRY control structure of the compilation unit, which catches all possible exceptions by specifying the most generic exception class CX\_ROOT. If, for example, CX\_SY\_ARG\_OUT\_OF\_DOMAIN or one of its superclasses was not declared in the method interface, the exception CX\_SY\_NO\_HANDLER would be raised and would be handled in the final CATCH block.

Description

The method meth1 raises a non-resumable exception and the method meth2 raises a resumable exception that is handled in the TRY control structures of the method main using CATCH.

-   If handled without BEFORE UNWIND, the CLEANUP block is executed in both cases before handling and the context of the called method does not exist during handling.

-   If handled with BEFORE UNWIND, the context of the called method exists in both cases during handling and the CLEANUP block is executed after handling.

-   If a resumable exception is raised, the statement RESUME can be executed during handling, which ensures that processing in the called method is continued without its CLEANUP block being executed.

Description

This example shows the two variants of the statement RAISE EXCEPTION. The first statement raises an exception of the class CX\_DEMO\_CONSTRUCTOR in the inner TRY block, creates the relevant object, and passes the program name to the instance constructor. The inner CATCH block handles the exception, puts out the exception text and raises the exception again without creating a new object. The outer CATCH block handles the exception again. The CX\_DEMO\_CONSTRUCTOR class is defined in such a way that the passed program name appears in the exception text. The generated instance constructor ensures this.

The output of the line number in which the exception was raised indicates that, when the existing exception object was reused, its information was changed.

Description

-   If the content of number is greater than 100, the TRY control structure of the [compilation unit](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencompilation_unit_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") raises an exception of the class CX\_DEMO\_ABS\_TOO\_LARGE in the TRY block. This exception is handled by the second CATCH block of the same TRY control structure, since the subclass of the most general exception is CX\_ROOT.

-   If the content of number is 0, the runtime environment in the TRY block of the TRY control structure of the called method calculation raises an exception of the predefined class CX\_SY\_ZERODIVIDE. This is handled in the CATCH block of the same TRY control structure.

-   If the content of number is a negative number, the runtime environment in the TRY block of the TRY control structure of the called method calculation raises an exception of the predefined class CX\_SY\_ARG\_OUT\_OF\_DOMAIN. Since no handler is defined for this exception in this TRY control structure, the exception is propagated from the method, which is made possible by the declaration of the superclass CX\_SY\_ARITHMETIC\_ERROR using RAISING in the method interface. The CLEANUP block of the inner TRY control structure is executed first.

-   Any other exceptions are handled in the final CATCH block of the TRY control structure of the compilation unit, which catches all possible exceptions by specifying the most generic exception class CX\_ROOT. If, for example, CX\_SY\_ARG\_OUT\_OF\_DOMAIN or one of its superclasses was not declared in the method interface, the exception CX\_SY\_NO\_HANDLER would be raised and would be handled in the final CATCH block.

Description

The method meth1 raises a non-resumable exception and the method meth2 raises a resumable exception that is handled in the TRY control structures of the method main using CATCH.

-   If handled without BEFORE UNWIND, the CLEANUP block is executed in both cases before handling and the context of the called method does not exist during handling.

-   If handled with BEFORE UNWIND, the context of the called method exists in both cases during handling and the CLEANUP block is executed after handling.

-   If a resumable exception is raised, the statement RESUME can be executed during handling, which ensures that processing in the called method is continued without its CLEANUP block being executed.

Description

This example shows the two variants of the statement RAISE EXCEPTION. The first statement raises an exception of the class CX\_DEMO\_CONSTRUCTOR in the inner TRY block, creates the relevant object, and passes the program name to the instance constructor. The inner CATCH block handles the exception, puts out the exception text and raises the exception again without creating a new object. The outer CATCH block handles the exception again. The CX\_DEMO\_CONSTRUCTOR class is defined in such a way that the passed program name appears in the exception text. The generated instance constructor ensures this.

The output of the line number in which the exception was raised indicates that, when the existing exception object was reused, its information was changed.

Description

-   If the content of number is greater than 100, the TRY control structure of the [compilation unit](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencompilation_unit_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") raises an exception of the class CX\_DEMO\_ABS\_TOO\_LARGE in the TRY block. This exception is handled by the second CATCH block of the same TRY control structure, since the subclass of the most general exception is CX\_ROOT.

-   If the content of number is 0, the runtime environment in the TRY block of the TRY control structure of the called method calculation raises an exception of the predefined class CX\_SY\_ZERODIVIDE. This is handled in the CATCH block of the same TRY control structure.

-   If the content of number is a negative number, the runtime environment in the TRY block of the TRY control structure of the called method calculation raises an exception of the predefined class CX\_SY\_ARG\_OUT\_OF\_DOMAIN. Since no handler is defined for this exception in this TRY control structure, the exception is propagated from the method, which is made possible by the declaration of the superclass CX\_SY\_ARITHMETIC\_ERROR using RAISING in the method interface. The CLEANUP block of the inner TRY control structure is executed first.

-   Any other exceptions are handled in the final CATCH block of the TRY control structure of the compilation unit, which catches all possible exceptions by specifying the most generic exception class CX\_ROOT. If, for example, CX\_SY\_ARG\_OUT\_OF\_DOMAIN or one of its superclasses was not declared in the method interface, the exception CX\_SY\_NO\_HANDLER would be raised and would be handled in the final CATCH block.

Description

The method meth1 raises a non-resumable exception and the method meth2 raises a resumable exception that is handled in the TRY control structures of the method main using CATCH.

-   If handled without BEFORE UNWIND, the CLEANUP block is executed in both cases before handling and the context of the called method does not exist during handling.

-   If handled with BEFORE UNWIND, the context of the called method exists in both cases during handling and the CLEANUP block is executed after handling.

-   If a resumable exception is raised, the statement RESUME can be executed during handling, which ensures that processing in the called method is continued without its CLEANUP block being executed.

Description

This example shows the two variants of the statement RAISE EXCEPTION. The first statement raises an exception of the class CX\_DEMO\_CONSTRUCTOR in the inner TRY block, creates the relevant object, and passes the program name to the instance constructor. The inner CATCH block handles the exception, puts out the exception text and raises the exception again without creating a new object. The outer CATCH block handles the exception again. The CX\_DEMO\_CONSTRUCTOR class is defined in such a way that the passed program name appears in the exception text. The generated instance constructor ensures this.

The output of the line number in which the exception was raised indicates that, when the existing exception object was reused, its information was changed.

Description

-   If the content of number is greater than 100, the TRY control structure of the [compilation unit](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencompilation_unit_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") raises an exception of the class CX\_DEMO\_ABS\_TOO\_LARGE in the TRY block. This exception is handled by the second CATCH block of the same TRY control structure, since the subclass of the most general exception is CX\_ROOT.

-   If the content of number is 0, the runtime environment in the TRY block of the TRY control structure of the called method calculation raises an exception of the predefined class CX\_SY\_ZERODIVIDE. This is handled in the CATCH block of the same TRY control structure.

-   If the content of number is a negative number, the runtime environment in the TRY block of the TRY control structure of the called method calculation raises an exception of the predefined class CX\_SY\_ARG\_OUT\_OF\_DOMAIN. Since no handler is defined for this exception in this TRY control structure, the exception is propagated from the method, which is made possible by the declaration of the superclass CX\_SY\_ARITHMETIC\_ERROR using RAISING in the method interface. The CLEANUP block of the inner TRY control structure is executed first.

-   Any other exceptions are handled in the final CATCH block of the TRY control structure of the compilation unit, which catches all possible exceptions by specifying the most generic exception class CX\_ROOT. If, for example, CX\_SY\_ARG\_OUT\_OF\_DOMAIN or one of its superclasses was not declared in the method interface, the exception CX\_SY\_NO\_HANDLER would be raised and would be handled in the final CATCH block.

Description

The method meth1 raises a non-resumable exception and the method meth2 raises a resumable exception that is handled in the TRY control structures of the method main using CATCH.

-   If handled without BEFORE UNWIND, the CLEANUP block is executed in both cases before handling and the context of the called method does not exist during handling.

-   If handled with BEFORE UNWIND, the context of the called method exists in both cases during handling and the CLEANUP block is executed after handling.

-   If a resumable exception is raised, the statement RESUME can be executed during handling, which ensures that processing in the called method is continued without its CLEANUP block being executed.

Exceptions in ABAP Statements

Error situations that occur during the execution of an ABAP statement raise exceptions. These exceptions are fully integrated into the [exception concept](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_exceptions.htm) and are raised by the runtime environment. Two types of exception exist:

-   Catchable exceptions that are based on [predefined](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_exception_classes.htm) [exception classes](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenexception_class_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

-   Uncatchable exceptions that directly produce [runtime errors](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenruntime_error_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Each catchable exception is assigned to a runtime error that terminates the program if the exception is neither handled nor propagated to a caller. The keyword documentation lists the type of exceptions that can be raised for each statement.

For reasons of backward compatibility, catchable exceptions raised by many ABAP statements can be caught by using both [TRY ... ENDTRY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abaptry.htm) and the obsolete statement [CATCH SYSTEM-EXCEPTIONS ... ENDCATCH](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcatch_sys.htm). To do this, the runtime error assigned to the exception class must be [catchable](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencatchable_runtime_error_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). Within processing blocks, the two mechanisms prevent each other from handling exceptions. It is advisable to catch an exception between TRY ... ENDTRY using CATCH or to use the RAISING addition in the definition of the interface to propagate it to the caller. Catching exceptions using CATCH SYSTEM-EXCEPTIONS is no longer recommended.

Example

Unhandled Exception

The following program lines produce the runtime error COMPUTE\_INT\_ZERODIVIDE because division by zero is invalid and this exception situation is not handled:

DATA result TYPE i.
result = 1 / 0.

Handling Exceptions Using Exception Classes

The above exception is represented by the exception class CX\_SY\_ZERODIVIDE, which is a subclass of the exception class CX\_SY\_ARITHMETIC\_ERROR. Therefore, the exception can be handled as follows (the ERR\_TEXT variable is passed the text 'Division by zero.'):

DATA myref TYPE REF TO cx\_sy\_arithmetic\_error.
DATA err\_text TYPE string.
DATA result TYPE i.
TRY.
¬†¬†¬†¬†result = 1 / 0.
¬†¬†CATCH cx\_sy\_arithmetic\_error INTO myref.
¬†¬†¬†¬†err\_text = myref->get\_text( ).
ENDTRY.

Handling Exceptions as Catchable Runtime Errors

Since the runtime error COMPUTE\_INT\_ZERODIVIDE is catchable and assigned to the [exception group](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenexception_group_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") ARITHMETIC\_ERRORS, it can also be handled using the obsolete statement [CATCH SYSTEM-EXCEPTIONS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcatch_sys.htm).

DATA result TYPE i.
CATCH SYSTEM-EXCEPTIONS arithmetic\_errors = 4.
¬†¬†result = 1 / 0.
ENDCATCH.
IF sy-subrc = 4.
¬†¬†...
ENDIF.

Exception Classes for ABAP Statements

The catchable [exceptions in ABAP statements](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_language_exceptions.htm) can be caught using the predefined exception classes listed below, which are subclasses of the classes CX\_DYNAMIC\_CHECK and CX\_NO\_CHECK. These exception classes replace the obsolete [catchable runtime errors](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencatchable_runtime_error_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The keyword documentation lists the type of exceptions that can be raised for each statement.

To improve the structure, intermediate abstract classes were introduced so that groups of exceptions can be caught simultaneously.

Each exception class includes message texts, which can be found in the Texts tab in the [Class Builder](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenclass_builder_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

\=, Assignment Operator

Syntax

lhs = rhs.

Effect

If the character \= is specified in a statement between a left side lhs (or "left hand side") and a right side rhs (or "right hand side"), it works like an [assignment operator](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenassignment_operator_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that assigns the value of the right side to the left side, using a [conversion](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconversion_rules.htm) if necessary.

The right side rhs, which is the source of the assignment, is a [general expression position](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abengeneral_expr_position_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and can be specified as follows:

-   As a single [data object](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmove.htm)

-   As a [return value or result](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenequals_return_values.htm) of functional methods, built-in functions, or constructor expressions or table expressions

-   As a result of [calculation expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenequals_calc_expr.htm)

The left side lhs, the target of the assignment, is a both a [declaration position](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendeclaration_position_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and a [result position](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenresult_position_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and can be specified as follows:

-   As any data object that can be specified in a [write position](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenwriting_position_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The data type of the data object must either be [compatible](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencompatible_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") with the assigned value or must be convertible to the data type of lhs in accordance with one of the [conversion rules](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconversion_rules.htm). If the assigned value does not match the data type of lhs, the exceptions described in the conversion rules can occur.

-   As an inline declaration [DATA(var)](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendata_inline.htm). The data type of the declared variable is determined by the right side and is described as one of the rhs options. Any variable that is used on the right side cannot be declared on the left side. An identically named data object of a more global context can be used on the right side and is not hidden by the local declaration until after the statement.

-   As a [writable expression](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenwritable_expression_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") representing an operand to which the right side can be assigned.

If an exception is raised on the right side, the statement is not executed, and the value of the target field is undefined.

Hints

-   See also [calculation assignments](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencalculation_assignment_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") with the operators [+=](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencalculation_assignments.htm), [\-=](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencalculation_assignments.htm), [\*=](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencalculation_assignments.htm), [/=](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencalculation_assignments.htm), and [&&=](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencalculation_assignment_string.htm).

-   If lhs is a data object, it can be prefixed with the obsolete keyword [COMPUTE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcompute.htm), which has no effect and should therefore be omitted.

-   Another obsolete form of the assignment is the statement [MOVE rhs TO lhs](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmove_obs.htm), where the left side is on the right side and does not include all options of the assignment operator \=.

Programming Guideline

[Assignments with the assignment operators \= and ?= only](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenassign_calc_guidl.htm "Guideline")

Example

Assignments of a literal, a constructor expression, and an arithmetic expression to target fields.

DATA: o1 TYPE i,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†o2 TYPE i,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†r¬†¬†TYPE i.
o1 = 100.
o2 = CONV #( '200' ).
r¬†¬†= o1 + o2.

\=, Assign Data Objects

Syntax

destination = dobj.

Effect

In the simplest assignment case, a data object dobj is on the right side of the [assignment operator \=](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenequals_operator.htm) and can be specified as described under [Read Positions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendata_objects_usage_reading.htm). The content of the data object is assigned to the left side, destination. If necessary, type-dependent conversions are made in accordance with the [conversion rules](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconversion_rules.htm). The variant shown here applies to all assignments between operands that are not reference variables. Special [rules](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmove_cast.htm) apply to reference variables.

The following can be specified for destination:

-   Any data object that can be specified in a [write position](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenwriting_position_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The data type of the data object must be either [compatible](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencompatible_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") with the data type of dobj or the content of dobj must be convertible to the data type of destination in accordance with one of the [conversion rules](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconversion_rules.htm).

-   An inline declaration [DATA(var)](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendata_inline.htm). If the data type of dobj is complete, it is used for the declaration. If dobj is a generically typed field symbol or a formal parameter of this type, the following data types are used:

-   string for csequence and clike

-   xstring for xsequence

-   decfloat34 for numeric and decfloat

-   p with the length 8 and no decimal places if p is generic

-   The [standard key](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenstandard_key_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") for a standard table type with generic primary table key

Other generic data types other than table types that are explicitly generic with respect to their secondary table keys cannot be made more concrete and produce a syntax error.

Hints

-   The special assignment operator [?=](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmove_cast.htm) performs [down casts](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendown_cast_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and is available for [assignments of reference variables](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenreference_assignments.htm).
    

-   If dobj and/or destination are field symbols, the content of the data objects to which the field symbols point is used as in all ABAP statements. The actual pointer content of a field symbol can only be changed using the statement [ASSIGN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapassign.htm) or the addition ASSIGNING when processing internal tables ([value semantics](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenvalue_semantics_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")).
    

-   Inline declarations are not possible for every conceivable generic type of dobj. This is because the rules for deriving the used data type apply even in an inline declaration at the position of an actual parameter for a generically typed output parameter of a method apply. Here, the typing check allows fewer combinations than the conversion rules of an assignment.
    

-   Strings and internal tables are addressed internally using references. When assignments are made between strings and between internal tables of the same type (if the line types themselves do not contain any table types), only the internal administrative information is passed for performance reasons. After the assignment, the actual string or the actual [table body](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abentable_body_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is addressed by the source object as well as the target object ([sharing](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abensharing_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")). Sharing is only removed when the data object is accessed to be changed and a copy of the content is made. The sharing is shown in the memory consumption display of the ABAP Debugger and in the [Memory Inspector](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenmemory_inspector_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") tool. For internal tables whose line type itself contains internal table types, no sharing takes place. Sharing can, however, take place for the subtables of a certain line type.
    

-   If an internal table with a [header line](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenheader_line_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is specified as an operand of an assignment, in nearly all [operand positions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenoperands_data_objects.htm), the header line is addressed and not the [table body](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abentable_body_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). To address the table body of a table with a header line, \[\] must be appended to the table name.
    

-   The statement [MOVE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmove_obs.htm) is an obsolete way of assigning data objects.
    

Example

Assignment of a literal to a text string.

DATA text TYPE string.
text = \`blah\`.

Example

Assignment of a generically typed field symbol, <fs>, to a data object, number, declared inline. In the assignment, the field symbol has the type i but the field number is already created with the type decfloat34 when the program is generated. A syntax check warning about this is hidden using the pragma ##type.

FIELD-SYMBOLS <fs> TYPE numeric.
ASSIGN 1 TO <fs>.
DATA(number) = <fs> ##type.

Effect

If one of the following calls or expressions is specified on the right side of the [assignment operator \=](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenequals_operator.htm), their return value or result is determined and assigned to the left side, destination. If necessary, type-dependent conversions are performed in accordance with the [conversion rules](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconversion_rules.htm). The following items are possible on the right side:

-   A [functional method call](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenfunctional_method_call_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [meth( )](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall_method_functional.htm) including [method chainings](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall_method_static_chain.htm). The return value of a function method or an attribute addressed using a method chaining always has a complete type that must match the type of the left side.

-   A [built-in function](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbuiltin_function_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [func( )](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbuilt_in_functions_syntax.htm). The type of the return value, which can depend on the data type of the argument in some numeric functions, must match the type of the left side.

-   A [constructor expression](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconstructor_expression_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [constr\_expr](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconstructor_expressions.htm). The type of the result is determined by the type specified for the constructor expression and must match the type of the left side.

-   A [table expression](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abentable_expression_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [table\_expr](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abentable_expressions.htm). The type of the result must match the type on the left side.

The following can be specified for destination:

-   A [variable](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenvariable_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that is compatible with the return value or result, or in whose type the return value or result can be converted.

-   An inline declaration [DATA(var)](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendata_inline.htm). The data type of the declared variable var is the statically known type of the return value or result.

Hint

If an [arithmetic expression](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenarithmetic_expression_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is specified as an argument for one of the overloaded [numeric functions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenmathematical_functions.htm), the function itself works like an arithmetic expression and its assignment is one of the [assignments of arithmetic expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenequals_arith_expr.htm), which can cause a different order of conversions.

\=, Arithmetic Expression

Syntax

result = [arith\_exp](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcompute_arith.htm).

Effect

If an [arithmetic expression](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenarithmetic_expression_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [arith\_exp](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcompute_arith.htm) is specified on the right side of the [assignment operator \=](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenequals_operator.htm), its [calculation type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencalculation_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is calculated and assigned to the left side result.

The following can be specified for result:

-   A [variable](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenvariable_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that is compatible with the numeric result of the arithmetic expression or to whose type the result can be converted.

-   An inline declaration [DATA(var)](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendata_inline.htm). The data type of the declared variable var is the statically known [calculation type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencalculation_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), where generically typed field symbols and formal parameters contribute using a [standard type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenstandard_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [described there](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenarith_type.htm). In the case of the calculation type p, the data type of the declared variable is always p with the length 8 without decimal places.

If an existing variable is specified for result, its data type is included in the determination of the [calculation type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenarith_type.htm). If the calculation type is not the data type of result, the result is converted to the data type of the result field before the assignment is made.

Hints

-   The consideration of the result field when the calculation type is determined is a special property of ABAP that should always be kept in mind.

-   The calculation type that is dependent on the data type of the result field is an important difference from an [assignment of data objects](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmove.htm). If data objects are incompatible, the source field is always converted to the data type of the target field. When arithmetic expressions are assigned, their operands can also be converted to the data type of the result field before the calculation.

-   The fact that a [calculation type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencalculation_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") p on the right side of an inline declaration produces the data type p with length 8 and no decimal places can lead to unexpected results and raise exceptions. It is best to either avoid inline declarations when using the calculation type p or to determine the data type by applying the conversion operator [CONV](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconstructor_expression_conv.htm) to the arithmetic expression.

-   See also [calculation assignments](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencalculation_assignment_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") with the operators [+=](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencalculation_assignments.htm), [\-=](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencalculation_assignments.htm), [\*=](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencalculation_assignments.htm) and [/=](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencalculation_assignments.htm).

Example

The first assignment is an assignment of an arithmetic expression, because of the leading plus/minus sign. The [calculation type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenarith_type.htm) is determined as i and result is given the value "731036", the number of days since 01.01.0001. The second assignment, on the other hand, has the same meaning as an [assignment of data objects](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmove.htm) and produces the value "20020704" in result.

DATA: result TYPE string,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†date¬†¬† TYPE d VALUE '20020704'.
result = + date.
result =¬†¬† date.

Example

This example demonstrates inline declarations with the calculation type p. Assignments of a data object use its data type, but assignments of an arithmetic expression with the calculation type p, the data type p with length 8 and without decimal places is used. This means that decimal places are lost in the first assignment and that the second assignment produces and overflow and its corresponding exception. The conversion operator CONV can be used to avoid these problems.

\=, String Expression

Syntax

result = [string\_exp](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcompute_string.htm).

Effect

If a [string expression](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenstring_expression_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [string\_exp](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcompute_string.htm) is specified on the right side of the [assignment operator \=](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenequals_operator.htm), its result of type string is calculated and assigned to the left side result.

The following can be specified for result:

-   A [variable](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenvariable_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that has type string or to whose data type the result can be converted.

-   An inline declaration [DATA(var)](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendata_inline.htm). The data type of the declared variable var is string.

Hints

-   In the following example, the result result is a variable with the type string, and strings are appended to this variable on the right side that cannot be recognized as dependent on result by the compiler:

result = result && dobj1 && dobj2 && ...

result = |result...{ dobj1 ... }...{ dobj2 ... }...|.

Here, no interim result is created but it is directly appended to the result. In all other cases, that is, data types other than string or when expressions or functions are appended on the right side, an interim result is created first and then assigned. This optimization improves performance, but it must be ensured that, especially in loops, this improvement is not canceled out by using expression or functions on the right side, even if they are not dependent on result). See also the [Performance Note](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenstring_expr_perfo.htm) for string expressions.

-   See also [calculation assignment](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencalculation_assignment_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") with the operator [\*\*=](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencalculation_assignment_string.htm).

Example

The first assignment declares a target field of the type string inline and assigns the chained text "12" to it. The second assignment converts the chained text "12" to the number 12.

DATA(text) = '1' && '2'.
DATA number TYPE i.

\=, Assignment Operator

Syntax

lhs = rhs.

Effect

If the character \= is specified in a statement between a left side lhs (or "left hand side") and a right side rhs (or "right hand side"), it works like an [assignment operator](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenassignment_operator_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that assigns the value of the right side to the left side, using a [conversion](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconversion_rules.htm) if necessary.

The right side rhs, which is the source of the assignment, is a [general expression position](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abengeneral_expr_position_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and can be specified as follows:

-   As a single [data object](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmove.htm)

-   As a [return value or result](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenequals_return_values.htm) of functional methods, built-in functions, or constructor expressions or table expressions

-   As a result of [calculation expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenequals_calc_expr.htm)

The left side lhs, the target of the assignment, is a both a [declaration position](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendeclaration_position_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and a [result position](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenresult_position_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and can be specified as follows:

-   As any data object that can be specified in a [write position](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenwriting_position_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The data type of the data object must either be [compatible](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencompatible_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") with the assigned value or must be convertible to the data type of lhs in accordance with one of the [conversion rules](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconversion_rules.htm). If the assigned value does not match the data type of lhs, the exceptions described in the conversion rules can occur.

-   As an inline declaration [DATA(var)](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendata_inline.htm). The data type of the declared variable is determined by the right side and is described as one of the rhs options. Any variable that is used on the right side cannot be declared on the left side. An identically named data object of a more global context can be used on the right side and is not hidden by the local declaration until after the statement.

-   As a [writable expression](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenwritable_expression_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") representing an operand to which the right side can be assigned.

If an exception is raised on the right side, the statement is not executed, and the value of the target field is undefined.

Hints

-   See also [calculation assignments](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencalculation_assignment_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") with the operators [+=](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencalculation_assignments.htm), [\-=](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencalculation_assignments.htm), [\*=](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencalculation_assignments.htm), [/=](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencalculation_assignments.htm), and [&&=](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencalculation_assignment_string.htm).

-   If lhs is a data object, it can be prefixed with the obsolete keyword [COMPUTE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcompute.htm), which has no effect and should therefore be omitted.

-   Another obsolete form of the assignment is the statement [MOVE rhs TO lhs](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmove_obs.htm), where the left side is on the right side and does not include all options of the assignment operator \=.

Programming Guideline

[Assignments with the assignment operators \= and ?= only](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenassign_calc_guidl.htm "Guideline")

Example

Assignments of a literal, a constructor expression, and an arithmetic expression to target fields.

DATA: o1 TYPE i,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†o2 TYPE i,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†r¬†¬†TYPE i.
o1 = 100.
o2 = CONV #( '200' ).

\=, Assign Data Objects

Syntax

destination = dobj.

Effect

In the simplest assignment case, a data object dobj is on the right side of the [assignment operator \=](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenequals_operator.htm) and can be specified as described under [Read Positions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendata_objects_usage_reading.htm). The content of the data object is assigned to the left side, destination. If necessary, type-dependent conversions are made in accordance with the [conversion rules](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconversion_rules.htm). The variant shown here applies to all assignments between operands that are not reference variables. Special [rules](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmove_cast.htm) apply to reference variables.

The following can be specified for destination:

-   Any data object that can be specified in a [write position](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenwriting_position_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The data type of the data object must be either [compatible](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencompatible_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") with the data type of dobj or the content of dobj must be convertible to the data type of destination in accordance with one of the [conversion rules](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconversion_rules.htm).

-   An inline declaration [DATA(var)](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendata_inline.htm). If the data type of dobj is complete, it is used for the declaration. If dobj is a generically typed field symbol or a formal parameter of this type, the following data types are used:

-   string for csequence and clike

-   xstring for xsequence

-   decfloat34 for numeric and decfloat

-   p with the length 8 and no decimal places if p is generic

-   The [standard key](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenstandard_key_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") for a standard table type with generic primary table key

Other generic data types other than table types that are explicitly generic with respect to their secondary table keys cannot be made more concrete and produce a syntax error.

Hints

-   The special assignment operator [?=](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmove_cast.htm) performs [down casts](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendown_cast_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and is available for [assignments of reference variables](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenreference_assignments.htm).
    

-   If dobj and/or destination are field symbols, the content of the data objects to which the field symbols point is used as in all ABAP statements. The actual pointer content of a field symbol can only be changed using the statement [ASSIGN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapassign.htm) or the addition ASSIGNING when processing internal tables ([value semantics](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenvalue_semantics_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")).
    

-   Inline declarations are not possible for every conceivable generic type of dobj. This is because the rules for deriving the used data type apply even in an inline declaration at the position of an actual parameter for a generically typed output parameter of a method apply. Here, the typing check allows fewer combinations than the conversion rules of an assignment.
    

-   Strings and internal tables are addressed internally using references. When assignments are made between strings and between internal tables of the same type (if the line types themselves do not contain any table types), only the internal administrative information is passed for performance reasons. After the assignment, the actual string or the actual [table body](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abentable_body_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is addressed by the source object as well as the target object ([sharing](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abensharing_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")). Sharing is only removed when the data object is accessed to be changed and a copy of the content is made. The sharing is shown in the memory consumption display of the ABAP Debugger and in the [Memory Inspector](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenmemory_inspector_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") tool. For internal tables whose line type itself contains internal table types, no sharing takes place. Sharing can, however, take place for the subtables of a certain line type.
    

-   If an internal table with a [header line](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenheader_line_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is specified as an operand of an assignment, in nearly all [operand positions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenoperands_data_objects.htm), the header line is addressed and not the [table body](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abentable_body_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). To address the table body of a table with a header line, \[\] must be appended to the table name.
    

-   The statement [MOVE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmove_obs.htm) is an obsolete way of assigning data objects.
    

Example

Assignment of a literal to a text string.

DATA text TYPE string.
text = \`blah\`.

Example

Assignment of a generically typed field symbol, <fs>, to a data object, number, declared inline. In the assignment, the field symbol has the type i but the field number is already created with the type decfloat34 when the program is generated. A syntax check warning about this is hidden using the pragma ##type.

FIELD-SYMBOLS <fs> TYPE numeric.
ASSIGN 1 TO <fs>.
DATA(number) = <fs> ##type.

Effect

If one of the following calls or expressions is specified on the right side of the [assignment operator \=](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenequals_operator.htm), their return value or result is determined and assigned to the left side, destination. If necessary, type-dependent conversions are performed in accordance with the [conversion rules](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconversion_rules.htm). The following items are possible on the right side:

-   A [functional method call](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenfunctional_method_call_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [meth( )](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall_method_functional.htm) including [method chainings](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall_method_static_chain.htm). The return value of a function method or an attribute addressed using a method chaining always has a complete type that must match the type of the left side.

-   A [built-in function](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbuiltin_function_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [func( )](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbuilt_in_functions_syntax.htm). The type of the return value, which can depend on the data type of the argument in some numeric functions, must match the type of the left side.

-   A [constructor expression](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconstructor_expression_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [constr\_expr](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconstructor_expressions.htm). The type of the result is determined by the type specified for the constructor expression and must match the type of the left side.

-   A [table expression](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abentable_expression_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [table\_expr](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abentable_expressions.htm). The type of the result must match the type on the left side.

The following can be specified for destination:

-   A [variable](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenvariable_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that is compatible with the return value or result, or in whose type the return value or result can be converted.

-   An inline declaration [DATA(var)](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendata_inline.htm). The data type of the declared variable var is the statically known type of the return value or result.

Hint

If an [arithmetic expression](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenarithmetic_expression_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is specified as an argument for one of the overloaded [numeric functions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenmathematical_functions.htm), the function itself works like an arithmetic expression and its assignment is one of the [assignments of arithmetic expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenequals_arith_expr.htm), which can cause a different order of conversions.

Example

Assignment of the return value of a method to an internal table declared inline.

¬†¬†DATA(itab) = m2( ).
¬†¬†...

\=, Arithmetic Expression

Syntax

result = [arith\_exp](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcompute_arith.htm).

Effect

If an [arithmetic expression](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenarithmetic_expression_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [arith\_exp](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcompute_arith.htm) is specified on the right side of the [assignment operator \=](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenequals_operator.htm), its [calculation type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencalculation_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is calculated and assigned to the left side result.

The following can be specified for result:

-   A [variable](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenvariable_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that is compatible with the numeric result of the arithmetic expression or to whose type the result can be converted.

-   An inline declaration [DATA(var)](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendata_inline.htm). The data type of the declared variable var is the statically known [calculation type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencalculation_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), where generically typed field symbols and formal parameters contribute using a [standard type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenstandard_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [described there](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenarith_type.htm). In the case of the calculation type p, the data type of the declared variable is always p with the length 8 without decimal places.

If an existing variable is specified for result, its data type is included in the determination of the [calculation type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenarith_type.htm). If the calculation type is not the data type of result, the result is converted to the data type of the result field before the assignment is made.

Hints

-   The consideration of the result field when the calculation type is determined is a special property of ABAP that should always be kept in mind.

-   The calculation type that is dependent on the data type of the result field is an important difference from an [assignment of data objects](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmove.htm). If data objects are incompatible, the source field is always converted to the data type of the target field. When arithmetic expressions are assigned, their operands can also be converted to the data type of the result field before the calculation.

-   The fact that a [calculation type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencalculation_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") p on the right side of an inline declaration produces the data type p with length 8 and no decimal places can lead to unexpected results and raise exceptions. It is best to either avoid inline declarations when using the calculation type p or to determine the data type by applying the conversion operator [CONV](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconstructor_expression_conv.htm) to the arithmetic expression.

-   See also [calculation assignments](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencalculation_assignment_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") with the operators [+=](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencalculation_assignments.htm), [\-=](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencalculation_assignments.htm), [\*=](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencalculation_assignments.htm) and [/=](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencalculation_assignments.htm).

Example

The first assignment is an assignment of an arithmetic expression, because of the leading plus/minus sign. The [calculation type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenarith_type.htm) is determined as i and result is given the value "731036", the number of days since 01.01.0001. The second assignment, on the other hand, has the same meaning as an [assignment of data objects](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmove.htm) and produces the value "20020704" in result.

DATA: result TYPE string,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†date¬†¬† TYPE d VALUE '20020704'.
result = + date.
result =¬†¬† date.

Example

This example demonstrates inline declarations with the calculation type p. Assignments of a data object use its data type, but assignments of an arithmetic expression with the calculation type p, the data type p with length 8 and without decimal places is used. This means that decimal places are lost in the first assignment and that the second assignment produces and overflow and its corresponding exception. The conversion operator CONV can be used to avoid these problems.

\=, String Expression

Syntax

result = [string\_exp](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcompute_string.htm).

Effect

If a [string expression](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenstring_expression_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [string\_exp](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcompute_string.htm) is specified on the right side of the [assignment operator \=](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenequals_operator.htm), its result of type string is calculated and assigned to the left side result.

The following can be specified for result:

-   A [variable](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenvariable_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that has type string or to whose data type the result can be converted.

-   An inline declaration [DATA(var)](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendata_inline.htm). The data type of the declared variable var is string.

Hints

-   In the following example, the result result is a variable with the type string, and strings are appended to this variable on the right side that cannot be recognized as dependent on result by the compiler:

result = result && dobj1 && dobj2 && ...

result = |result...{ dobj1 ... }...{ dobj2 ... }...|.

Here, no interim result is created but it is directly appended to the result. In all other cases, that is, data types other than string or when expressions or functions are appended on the right side, an interim result is created first and then assigned. This optimization improves performance, but it must be ensured that, especially in loops, this improvement is not canceled out by using expression or functions on the right side, even if they are not dependent on result). See also the [Performance Note](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenstring_expr_perfo.htm) for string expressions.

-   See also [calculation assignment](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencalculation_assignment_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") with the operator [\*\*=](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencalculation_assignment_string.htm).

Example

The first assignment declares a target field of the type string inline and assigns the chained text "12" to it. The second assignment converts the chained text "12" to the number 12.

DATA(text) = '1' && '2'.
DATA number TYPE i.
number = 1 && 2.

\=, Assignment Operator

Syntax

lhs = rhs.

Effect

If the character \= is specified in a statement between a left side lhs (or "left hand side") and a right side rhs (or "right hand side"), it works like an [assignment operator](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenassignment_operator_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that assigns the value of the right side to the left side, using a [conversion](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconversion_rules.htm) if necessary.

The right side rhs, which is the source of the assignment, is a [general expression position](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abengeneral_expr_position_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and can be specified as follows:

-   As a single [data object](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmove.htm)

-   As a [return value or result](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenequals_return_values.htm) of functional methods, built-in functions, or constructor expressions or table expressions

-   As a result of [calculation expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenequals_calc_expr.htm)

The left side lhs, the target of the assignment, is a both a [declaration position](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendeclaration_position_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and a [result position](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenresult_position_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and can be specified as follows:

-   As any data object that can be specified in a [write position](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenwriting_position_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The data type of the data object must either be [compatible](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencompatible_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") with the assigned value or must be convertible to the data type of lhs in accordance with one of the [conversion rules](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconversion_rules.htm). If the assigned value does not match the data type of lhs, the exceptions described in the conversion rules can occur.

-   As an inline declaration [DATA(var)](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendata_inline.htm). The data type of the declared variable is determined by the right side and is described as one of the rhs options. Any variable that is used on the right side cannot be declared on the left side. An identically named data object of a more global context can be used on the right side and is not hidden by the local declaration until after the statement.

-   As a [writable expression](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenwritable_expression_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") representing an operand to which the right side can be assigned.

If an exception is raised on the right side, the statement is not executed, and the value of the target field is undefined.

Hints

-   See also [calculation assignments](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencalculation_assignment_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") with the operators [+=](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencalculation_assignments.htm), [\-=](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencalculation_assignments.htm), [\*=](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencalculation_assignments.htm), [/=](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencalculation_assignments.htm), and [&&=](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencalculation_assignment_string.htm).

-   If lhs is a data object, it can be prefixed with the obsolete keyword [COMPUTE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcompute.htm), which has no effect and should therefore be omitted.

-   Another obsolete form of the assignment is the statement [MOVE rhs TO lhs](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmove_obs.htm), where the left side is on the right side and does not include all options of the assignment operator \=.

Programming Guideline

[Assignments with the assignment operators \= and ?= only](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenassign_calc_guidl.htm "Guideline")

Example

Assignments of a literal, a constructor expression, and an arithmetic expression to target fields.

DATA: o1 TYPE i,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†o2 TYPE i,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†r¬†¬†TYPE i.
o1 = 100.
o2 = CONV #( '200' ).

\=, Assign Data Objects

Syntax

destination = dobj.

Effect

In the simplest assignment case, a data object dobj is on the right side of the [assignment operator \=](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenequals_operator.htm) and can be specified as described under [Read Positions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendata_objects_usage_reading.htm). The content of the data object is assigned to the left side, destination. If necessary, type-dependent conversions are made in accordance with the [conversion rules](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconversion_rules.htm). The variant shown here applies to all assignments between operands that are not reference variables. Special [rules](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmove_cast.htm) apply to reference variables.

The following can be specified for destination:

-   Any data object that can be specified in a [write position](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenwriting_position_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The data type of the data object must be either [compatible](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencompatible_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") with the data type of dobj or the content of dobj must be convertible to the data type of destination in accordance with one of the [conversion rules](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconversion_rules.htm).

-   An inline declaration [DATA(var)](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendata_inline.htm). If the data type of dobj is complete, it is used for the declaration. If dobj is a generically typed field symbol or a formal parameter of this type, the following data types are used:

-   string for csequence and clike

-   xstring for xsequence

-   decfloat34 for numeric and decfloat

-   p with the length 8 and no decimal places if p is generic

-   The [standard key](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenstandard_key_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") for a standard table type with generic primary table key

Other generic data types other than table types that are explicitly generic with respect to their secondary table keys cannot be made more concrete and produce a syntax error.

Hints

-   The special assignment operator [?=](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmove_cast.htm) performs [down casts](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendown_cast_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and is available for [assignments of reference variables](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenreference_assignments.htm).
    

-   If dobj and/or destination are field symbols, the content of the data objects to which the field symbols point is used as in all ABAP statements. The actual pointer content of a field symbol can only be changed using the statement [ASSIGN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapassign.htm) or the addition ASSIGNING when processing internal tables ([value semantics](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenvalue_semantics_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")).
    

-   Inline declarations are not possible for every conceivable generic type of dobj. This is because the rules for deriving the used data type apply even in an inline declaration at the position of an actual parameter for a generically typed output parameter of a method apply. Here, the typing check allows fewer combinations than the conversion rules of an assignment.
    

-   Strings and internal tables are addressed internally using references. When assignments are made between strings and between internal tables of the same type (if the line types themselves do not contain any table types), only the internal administrative information is passed for performance reasons. After the assignment, the actual string or the actual [table body](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abentable_body_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is addressed by the source object as well as the target object ([sharing](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abensharing_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")). Sharing is only removed when the data object is accessed to be changed and a copy of the content is made. The sharing is shown in the memory consumption display of the ABAP Debugger and in the [Memory Inspector](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenmemory_inspector_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") tool. For internal tables whose line type itself contains internal table types, no sharing takes place. Sharing can, however, take place for the subtables of a certain line type.
    

-   If an internal table with a [header line](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenheader_line_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is specified as an operand of an assignment, in nearly all [operand positions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenoperands_data_objects.htm), the header line is addressed and not the [table body](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abentable_body_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). To address the table body of a table with a header line, \[\] must be appended to the table name.
    

-   The statement [MOVE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmove_obs.htm) is an obsolete way of assigning data objects.
    

Example

Assignment of a literal to a text string.

DATA text TYPE string.
text = \`blah\`.

Example

Assignment of a generically typed field symbol, <fs>, to a data object, number, declared inline. In the assignment, the field symbol has the type i but the field number is already created with the type decfloat34 when the program is generated. A syntax check warning about this is hidden using the pragma ##type.

FIELD-SYMBOLS <fs> TYPE numeric.
ASSIGN 1 TO <fs>.
DATA(number) = <fs> ##type.

Effect

If one of the following calls or expressions is specified on the right side of the [assignment operator \=](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenequals_operator.htm), their return value or result is determined and assigned to the left side, destination. If necessary, type-dependent conversions are performed in accordance with the [conversion rules](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconversion_rules.htm). The following items are possible on the right side:

-   A [functional method call](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenfunctional_method_call_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [meth( )](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall_method_functional.htm) including [method chainings](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall_method_static_chain.htm). The return value of a function method or an attribute addressed using a method chaining always has a complete type that must match the type of the left side.

-   A [built-in function](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbuiltin_function_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [func( )](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbuilt_in_functions_syntax.htm). The type of the return value, which can depend on the data type of the argument in some numeric functions, must match the type of the left side.

-   A [constructor expression](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconstructor_expression_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [constr\_expr](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconstructor_expressions.htm). The type of the result is determined by the type specified for the constructor expression and must match the type of the left side.

-   A [table expression](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abentable_expression_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [table\_expr](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abentable_expressions.htm). The type of the result must match the type on the left side.

The following can be specified for destination:

-   A [variable](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenvariable_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that is compatible with the return value or result, or in whose type the return value or result can be converted.

-   An inline declaration [DATA(var)](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendata_inline.htm). The data type of the declared variable var is the statically known type of the return value or result.

Hint

If an [arithmetic expression](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenarithmetic_expression_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is specified as an argument for one of the overloaded [numeric functions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenmathematical_functions.htm), the function itself works like an arithmetic expression and its assignment is one of the [assignments of arithmetic expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenequals_arith_expr.htm), which can cause a different order of conversions.

Example

Assignment of the return value of a method to an internal table declared inline.

METHOD m1.
¬†¬†DATA(itab) = m2( ).

\=, Arithmetic Expression

Syntax

result = [arith\_exp](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcompute_arith.htm).

Effect

If an [arithmetic expression](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenarithmetic_expression_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [arith\_exp](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcompute_arith.htm) is specified on the right side of the [assignment operator \=](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenequals_operator.htm), its [calculation type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencalculation_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is calculated and assigned to the left side result.

The following can be specified for result:

-   A [variable](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenvariable_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that is compatible with the numeric result of the arithmetic expression or to whose type the result can be converted.

-   An inline declaration [DATA(var)](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendata_inline.htm). The data type of the declared variable var is the statically known [calculation type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencalculation_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), where generically typed field symbols and formal parameters contribute using a [standard type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenstandard_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [described there](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenarith_type.htm). In the case of the calculation type p, the data type of the declared variable is always p with the length 8 without decimal places.

If an existing variable is specified for result, its data type is included in the determination of the [calculation type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenarith_type.htm). If the calculation type is not the data type of result, the result is converted to the data type of the result field before the assignment is made.

Hints

-   The consideration of the result field when the calculation type is determined is a special property of ABAP that should always be kept in mind.

-   The calculation type that is dependent on the data type of the result field is an important difference from an [assignment of data objects](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmove.htm). If data objects are incompatible, the source field is always converted to the data type of the target field. When arithmetic expressions are assigned, their operands can also be converted to the data type of the result field before the calculation.

-   The fact that a [calculation type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencalculation_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") p on the right side of an inline declaration produces the data type p with length 8 and no decimal places can lead to unexpected results and raise exceptions. It is best to either avoid inline declarations when using the calculation type p or to determine the data type by applying the conversion operator [CONV](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconstructor_expression_conv.htm) to the arithmetic expression.

-   See also [calculation assignments](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencalculation_assignment_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") with the operators [+=](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencalculation_assignments.htm), [\-=](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencalculation_assignments.htm), [\*=](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencalculation_assignments.htm) and [/=](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencalculation_assignments.htm).

Example

The first assignment is an assignment of an arithmetic expression, because of the leading plus/minus sign. The [calculation type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenarith_type.htm) is determined as i and result is given the value "731036", the number of days since 01.01.0001. The second assignment, on the other hand, has the same meaning as an [assignment of data objects](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmove.htm) and produces the value "20020704" in result.

DATA: result TYPE string,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†date¬†¬† TYPE d VALUE '20020704'.
result = + date.
result =¬†¬† date.

Example

This example demonstrates inline declarations with the calculation type p. Assignments of a data object use its data type, but assignments of an arithmetic expression with the calculation type p, the data type p with length 8 and without decimal places is used. This means that decimal places are lost in the first assignment and that the second assignment produces and overflow and its corresponding exception. The conversion operator CONV can be used to avoid these problems.

\=, String Expression

Syntax

result = [string\_exp](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcompute_string.htm).

Effect

If a [string expression](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenstring_expression_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [string\_exp](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcompute_string.htm) is specified on the right side of the [assignment operator \=](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenequals_operator.htm), its result of type string is calculated and assigned to the left side result.

The following can be specified for result:

-   A [variable](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenvariable_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that has type string or to whose data type the result can be converted.

-   An inline declaration [DATA(var)](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendata_inline.htm). The data type of the declared variable var is string.

Hints

-   In the following example, the result result is a variable with the type string, and strings are appended to this variable on the right side that cannot be recognized as dependent on result by the compiler:

result = result && dobj1 && dobj2 && ...

result = |result...{ dobj1 ... }...{ dobj2 ... }...|.

Here, no interim result is created but it is directly appended to the result. In all other cases, that is, data types other than string or when expressions or functions are appended on the right side, an interim result is created first and then assigned. This optimization improves performance, but it must be ensured that, especially in loops, this improvement is not canceled out by using expression or functions on the right side, even if they are not dependent on result). See also the [Performance Note](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenstring_expr_perfo.htm) for string expressions.

-   See also [calculation assignment](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencalculation_assignment_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") with the operator [\*\*=](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencalculation_assignment_string.htm).

Example

The first assignment declares a target field of the type string inline and assigns the chained text "12" to it. The second assignment converts the chained text "12" to the number 12.

DATA(text) = '1' && '2'.
DATA number TYPE i.
number = 1 && 2.

The following can be specified for result:

\=, Assignment Operator

Syntax

lhs = rhs.

Effect

If the character \= is specified in a statement between a left side lhs (or "left hand side") and a right side rhs (or "right hand side"), it works like an [assignment operator](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenassignment_operator_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that assigns the value of the right side to the left side, using a [conversion](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconversion_rules.htm) if necessary.

The right side rhs, which is the source of the assignment, is a [general expression position](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abengeneral_expr_position_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and can be specified as follows:

-   As a single [data object](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmove.htm)

-   As a [return value or result](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenequals_return_values.htm) of functional methods, built-in functions, or constructor expressions or table expressions

-   As a result of [calculation expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenequals_calc_expr.htm)

The left side lhs, the target of the assignment, is a both a [declaration position](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendeclaration_position_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and a [result position](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenresult_position_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and can be specified as follows:

-   As any data object that can be specified in a [write position](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenwriting_position_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The data type of the data object must either be [compatible](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencompatible_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") with the assigned value or must be convertible to the data type of lhs in accordance with one of the [conversion rules](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconversion_rules.htm). If the assigned value does not match the data type of lhs, the exceptions described in the conversion rules can occur.

-   As an inline declaration [DATA(var)](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendata_inline.htm). The data type of the declared variable is determined by the right side and is described as one of the rhs options. Any variable that is used on the right side cannot be declared on the left side. An identically named data object of a more global context can be used on the right side and is not hidden by the local declaration until after the statement.

-   As a [writable expression](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenwritable_expression_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") representing an operand to which the right side can be assigned.

If an exception is raised on the right side, the statement is not executed, and the value of the target field is undefined.

\=, Assign Data Objects

Syntax

destination = dobj.

Effect

In the simplest assignment case, a data object dobj is on the right side of the [assignment operator \=](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenequals_operator.htm) and can be specified as described under [Read Positions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendata_objects_usage_reading.htm). The content of the data object is assigned to the left side, destination. If necessary, type-dependent conversions are made in accordance with the [conversion rules](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconversion_rules.htm). The variant shown here applies to all assignments between operands that are not reference variables. Special [rules](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmove_cast.htm) apply to reference variables.

The following can be specified for destination:

-   Any data object that can be specified in a [write position](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenwriting_position_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The data type of the data object must be either [compatible](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencompatible_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") with the data type of dobj or the content of dobj must be convertible to the data type of destination in accordance with one of the [conversion rules](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconversion_rules.htm).

-   An inline declaration [DATA(var)](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendata_inline.htm). If the data type of dobj is complete, it is used for the declaration. If dobj is a generically typed field symbol or a formal parameter of this type, the following data types are used:

-   string for csequence and clike

-   xstring for xsequence

-   decfloat34 for numeric and decfloat

-   p with the length 8 and no decimal places if p is generic

-   The [standard key](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenstandard_key_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") for a standard table type with generic primary table key

Other generic data types other than table types that are explicitly generic with respect to their secondary table keys cannot be made more concrete and produce a syntax error.

Hints

-   The special assignment operator [?=](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmove_cast.htm) performs [down casts](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendown_cast_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and is available for [assignments of reference variables](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenreference_assignments.htm).
    

-   If dobj and/or destination are field symbols, the content of the data objects to which the field symbols point is used as in all ABAP statements. The actual pointer content of a field symbol can only be changed using the statement [ASSIGN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapassign.htm) or the addition ASSIGNING when processing internal tables ([value semantics](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenvalue_semantics_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")).
    

-   Inline declarations are not possible for every conceivable generic type of dobj. This is because the rules for deriving the used data type apply even in an inline declaration at the position of an actual parameter for a generically typed output parameter of a method apply. Here, the typing check allows fewer combinations than the conversion rules of an assignment.
    

-   Strings and internal tables are addressed internally using references. When assignments are made between strings and between internal tables of the same type (if the line types themselves do not contain any table types), only the internal administrative information is passed for performance reasons. After the assignment, the actual string or the actual [table body](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abentable_body_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is addressed by the source object as well as the target object ([sharing](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abensharing_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")). Sharing is only removed when the data object is accessed to be changed and a copy of the content is made. The sharing is shown in the memory consumption display of the ABAP Debugger and in the [Memory Inspector](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenmemory_inspector_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") tool. For internal tables whose line type itself contains internal table types, no sharing takes place. Sharing can, however, take place for the subtables of a certain line type.
    

-   If an internal table with a [header line](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenheader_line_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is specified as an operand of an assignment, in nearly all [operand positions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenoperands_data_objects.htm), the header line is addressed and not the [table body](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abentable_body_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). To address the table body of a table with a header line, \[\] must be appended to the table name.
    

-   The statement [MOVE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmove_obs.htm) is an obsolete way of assigning data objects.
    

Example

Assignment of a literal to a text string.

DATA text TYPE string.
text = \`blah\`.

Example

Assignment of a generically typed field symbol, <fs>, to a data object, number, declared inline. In the assignment, the field symbol has the type i but the field number is already created with the type decfloat34 when the program is generated. A syntax check warning about this is hidden using the pragma ##type.

FIELD-SYMBOLS <fs> TYPE numeric.
ASSIGN 1 TO <fs>.
DATA(number) = <fs> ##type.

Effect

If one of the following calls or expressions is specified on the right side of the [assignment operator \=](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenequals_operator.htm), their return value or result is determined and assigned to the left side, destination. If necessary, type-dependent conversions are performed in accordance with the [conversion rules](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconversion_rules.htm). The following items are possible on the right side:

-   A [functional method call](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenfunctional_method_call_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [meth( )](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall_method_functional.htm) including [method chainings](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall_method_static_chain.htm). The return value of a function method or an attribute addressed using a method chaining always has a complete type that must match the type of the left side.

-   A [built-in function](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbuiltin_function_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [func( )](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbuilt_in_functions_syntax.htm). The type of the return value, which can depend on the data type of the argument in some numeric functions, must match the type of the left side.

-   A [constructor expression](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconstructor_expression_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [constr\_expr](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconstructor_expressions.htm). The type of the result is determined by the type specified for the constructor expression and must match the type of the left side.

-   A [table expression](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abentable_expression_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [table\_expr](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abentable_expressions.htm). The type of the result must match the type on the left side.

The following can be specified for destination:

-   A [variable](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenvariable_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that is compatible with the return value or result, or in whose type the return value or result can be converted.

-   An inline declaration [DATA(var)](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendata_inline.htm). The data type of the declared variable var is the statically known type of the return value or result.

Hint

If an [arithmetic expression](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenarithmetic_expression_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is specified as an argument for one of the overloaded [numeric functions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenmathematical_functions.htm), the function itself works like an arithmetic expression and its assignment is one of the [assignments of arithmetic expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenequals_arith_expr.htm), which can cause a different order of conversions.

\=, Arithmetic Expression

Syntax

result = [arith\_exp](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcompute_arith.htm).

Effect

If an [arithmetic expression](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenarithmetic_expression_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [arith\_exp](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcompute_arith.htm) is specified on the right side of the [assignment operator \=](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenequals_operator.htm), its [calculation type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencalculation_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is calculated and assigned to the left side result.

The following can be specified for result:

-   A [variable](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenvariable_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that is compatible with the numeric result of the arithmetic expression or to whose type the result can be converted.

-   An inline declaration [DATA(var)](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendata_inline.htm). The data type of the declared variable var is the statically known [calculation type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencalculation_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), where generically typed field symbols and formal parameters contribute using a [standard type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenstandard_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [described there](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenarith_type.htm). In the case of the calculation type p, the data type of the declared variable is always p with the length 8 without decimal places.

If an existing variable is specified for result, its data type is included in the determination of the [calculation type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenarith_type.htm). If the calculation type is not the data type of result, the result is converted to the data type of the result field before the assignment is made.

Hints

-   The consideration of the result field when the calculation type is determined is a special property of ABAP that should always be kept in mind.

-   The calculation type that is dependent on the data type of the result field is an important difference from an [assignment of data objects](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmove.htm). If data objects are incompatible, the source field is always converted to the data type of the target field. When arithmetic expressions are assigned, their operands can also be converted to the data type of the result field before the calculation.

-   The fact that a [calculation type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencalculation_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") p on the right side of an inline declaration produces the data type p with length 8 and no decimal places can lead to unexpected results and raise exceptions. It is best to either avoid inline declarations when using the calculation type p or to determine the data type by applying the conversion operator [CONV](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconstructor_expression_conv.htm) to the arithmetic expression.

-   See also [calculation assignments](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencalculation_assignment_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") with the operators [+=](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencalculation_assignments.htm), [\-=](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencalculation_assignments.htm), [\*=](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencalculation_assignments.htm) and [/=](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencalculation_assignments.htm).

Example

The first assignment is an assignment of an arithmetic expression, because of the leading plus/minus sign. The [calculation type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenarith_type.htm) is determined as i and result is given the value "731036", the number of days since 01.01.0001. The second assignment, on the other hand, has the same meaning as an [assignment of data objects](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmove.htm) and produces the value "20020704" in result.

DATA: result TYPE string,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†date¬†¬† TYPE d VALUE '20020704'.
result = + date.
result =¬†¬† date.

Example

This example demonstrates inline declarations with the calculation type p. Assignments of a data object use its data type, but assignments of an arithmetic expression with the calculation type p, the data type p with length 8 and without decimal places is used. This means that decimal places are lost in the first assignment and that the second assignment produces and overflow and its corresponding exception. The conversion operator CONV can be used to avoid these problems.

\=, String Expression

Syntax

result = [string\_exp](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcompute_string.htm).

Effect

If a [string expression](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenstring_expression_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [string\_exp](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcompute_string.htm) is specified on the right side of the [assignment operator \=](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenequals_operator.htm), its result of type string is calculated and assigned to the left side result.

The following can be specified for result:

-   A [variable](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenvariable_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that has type string or to whose data type the result can be converted.

-   An inline declaration [DATA(var)](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendata_inline.htm). The data type of the declared variable var is string.

Hints

-   In the following example, the result result is a variable with the type string, and strings are appended to this variable on the right side that cannot be recognized as dependent on result by the compiler:

result = result && dobj1 && dobj2 && ...

result = |result...{ dobj1 ... }...{ dobj2 ... }...|.

Here, no interim result is created but it is directly appended to the result. In all other cases, that is, data types other than string or when expressions or functions are appended on the right side, an interim result is created first and then assigned. This optimization improves performance, but it must be ensured that, especially in loops, this improvement is not canceled out by using expression or functions on the right side, even if they are not dependent on result). See also the [Performance Note](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenstring_expr_perfo.htm) for string expressions.

-   See also [calculation assignment](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencalculation_assignment_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") with the operator [\*\*=](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencalculation_assignment_string.htm).

Example

The first assignment declares a target field of the type string inline and assigns the chained text "12" to it. The second assignment converts the chained text "12" to the number 12.

DATA(text) = '1' && '2'.
DATA number TYPE i.
number = 1 && 2.

The following can be specified for result:

-   A [variable](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenvariable_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") with the type x or xstring.

-   A [variable](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenvariable_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") with the type c or string .

-   An inline declaration [DATA(var)](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendata_inline.htm). The data type of the declared variable var is xstring.

Alternatives:

[1\. ... *{* *}*](#!ABAP_ALTERNATIVE_1@1@)
[2\. ... CASTING ...](#!ABAP_ALTERNATIVE_2@2@)

Effect

The specification casting\_spec defines the data type used to handle the memory area [mem\_area](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapassign_mem_area.htm) assigned to the field symbol when a statement contains the field symbol in an operand position. Either the addition CASTING can be specified or nothing at all. Outside of classes, the obsolete variants [obsolete\_casting](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapassign_casting_obsolete.htm) are also possible.

The following restrictions apply:

-   In assignments of [table expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapassign_mem_area_writable_exp.htm), only the first alternative can be used without further additions.

-   The CASTING addition cannot be used for [enumerated types](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenenumerated_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). This means that the assigned memory area must not be an [enumerated object](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenenumerated_object_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and the specified data type must not be an enumerated type.
    

Alternative 1

... *{* *}*

Effect

If nothing is specified for casting\_spec, the field symbol inherits the data type of the data object used in [mem\_area](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapassign_mem_area.htm) and the assigned memory area is handled accordingly. This data type must [match](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abentyping_check_general.htm) the [typing](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abentyping_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the field symbol.

Example

After the first assignment the field symbol has type c of length 3 and after the second assignment the field symbol has type string. The statement [DESCRIBE FIELD](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapdescribe_field.htm) returns the corresponding values C 3 and g.

FIELD-SYMBOLS <fs> TYPE csequence.

Alternative 2

... CASTING ...

Additions:

[1\. ... *{* *}*](#!ABAP_ADDITION_1@1@)
[2\. ... TYPE type*|*(name)](#!ABAP_ADDITION_2@2@)
[3\. ... LIKE dobj](#!ABAP_ADDITION_3@3@)
[4\. ... *\[*TYPE p*\]* DECIMALS dec](#!ABAP_ADDITION_4@4@)
[5\. ... TYPE HANDLE handle](#!ABAP_ADDITION_5@5@)

Effect

If the addition CASTING is used in casting\_spec, the memory area is handled as if it had the type specified by CASTING. If CASTING is specified, the field symbol cannot be typed using the obsolete addition STRUCTURE of the statement [FIELD-SYMBOLS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapfield-symbols.htm).

Casting can either take place implicitly using the typing of the field symbol or explicitly using one of the additions TYPE, LIKE, or DECIMALS. In explicit castings, the field symbol can only be typed generically, not completely.

Hints

-   If the data type determined by CASTING is [deep](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendeep_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or if deep data objects are stored in the assigned memory area, the deep components must appear with exactly the same type and position in the assigned memory area. In particular, this means that individual [reference variables](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenreference_variable_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") can be assigned to only one field symbol that is typed as a reference variable by the same [static type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenstatic_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
    

-   The static check of the statement ASSIGN using the addition CASTING is performed so that all errors are identified, regardless of the system or platform on which the check is run. A runtime check only checks the current system or the current platform. These checks also always take place if the field symbol <fs> is typed with the obsolete addition STRUCTURE of the statement FIELD-SYMBOLS.
    

-   If the addition CASTING is used, the result of the statement ASSIGN may be platform-dependent. The internal [byte order](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbyteorder.htm) of characters can, for example, be platform-dependent, which becomes apparent in a cast to a byte-like data type.
    

-   The memory area [mem\_area](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapassign_mem_area.htm) must meet the [alignment requirements](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenalignment.htm) of the data type specified by the casting. When flat elementary data types are specified, for example, the memory address mem\_area must be divisible as follows:

-   By 2 for the character-like data types c and n and the date/time types d and t.

-   By 4 for the numeric data type i.

-   By 8 for the numeric data types int8, f, and decfloat16.

-   By 8 for the time stamp type utclong.

-   By 16 for the numeric data type decfloat34.
    

Addition 1

... *{* *}*

Effect

If the addition CASTING is specified without further additions, the assigned memory area is cast to the type of the field symbol. The field symbol must be either completely typed or with one of the generic built-in ABAP types c, n, p, or x.

Example

Casting of the integer 333 as a byte field. Depending on the [byte order](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbyte_order_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), the output is either 4D01 or 014D.

TYPES hex4 TYPE x LENGTH 2.
FIELD-SYMBOLS <fs> TYPE hex4.
ASSIGN 333 TO <fs> CASTING.
cl\_demo\_output=>display( <fs> ).

Addition 2

... TYPE type*|*(name)

Effect

Explicit specification of a data type after TYPE. The name of the type can be specified as follows:

-   type

Direct static specification as type.

-   (name)

Specification as the content of a character-like data object name that contains the name of a data type in uppercase letters when the statement is executed. The following can be specified for name:

-   Literal or constants
    If the data object name is specified as a character literal or as a constant, it can be evaluated statically, and the specified type is identified as the used object.

-   Variable
    If the data object name is specified as a variable, it is specified only dynamically, and the content is not evaluated statically.

When the statement is executed, name is not evaluated until runtime in both cases.

The assigned memory area is cast to the specified type. The data type specified after TYPE cannot be generic, apart from the built-in ABAP types c, n, p, and x. Furthermore, [table categories](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abaptypes_tabkind.htm) and REF TO cannot be specified.

The field symbol <fs> can only be typed generically and not completely. The specified data type must [match](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abentyping_check.htm) the generic [typing](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abentyping_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the field symbol, meaning that [castings](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencast_casting_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") are allowed to specialize the generic typing but not to make it more general.

If a generic character-like type c or n is specified after TYPE, the length of the assigned memory area must be a multiple of the length of a character in the memory when the statement is executed.

Example

Casting of a time field to a structured type with three components.

TYPES:
¬†¬†BEGIN OF time,
¬†¬†¬†¬†hours¬†¬† TYPE c LENGTH 2,
¬†¬†¬†¬†minute¬†¬†TYPE c LENGTH 2,
¬†¬†¬†¬†seconds TYPE c LENGTH 2,
¬†¬†END OF time.
FIELD-SYMBOLS <fs> TYPE any.
ASSIGN sy-timlo TO <fs> CASTING TYPE time.
cl\_demo\_output=>display( <fs> ).

Example

In the following example, one of the two ASSIGN statements produces a runtime error because the alignment requirement for the type c is not met. Which of the statements produces the runtime error is not generally defined and depends on the preceding declarations.

DATA hex TYPE x LENGTH 10.
FIELD-SYMBOLS <fs> TYPE any.
ASSIGN hex+0(4) TO <fs> CASTING type c.
ASSIGN hex+1(4) TO <fs> CASTING type c.

Addition 3

... LIKE dobj

Effect

The following can be specified after LIKE:

-   A data object dobj according to the rules for [TYPES ... ¬†LIKE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abaptypes_referring.htm). The assigned memory area is cast to the data type of the data object.

-   A generically typed field symbol.

-   If a memory area is assigned to the field symbol, the data type used to handle the memory area is the object of the cast.

-   If no memory area is assigned to the field symbol, a standard type resulting from the following rules is used:
    any, c, clike, csequence, data, and simple produce c with length 1.
    decfloat produces decfloat34.
    n produces n with length 1.
    numeric and p produce p with length 8 and no decimal places.
    x and xsequence produce x of the length 1.
    Generic table types raise an exception of the class
    CX\_SY\_ASSIGN\_CAST\_ILLEGAL\_CAST.

-   A generically typed formal parameter.

-   If an actual parameter is assigned to the formal parameter, the data type of this parameter is the object of the cast.

-   If no actual parameter is assigned to an optional formal parameter, its [associated](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abentyping_generic.htm) [standard type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenstandard_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is used.

The field symbol <fs> can only be typed generically and not completely. The specified data type must [match](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abentyping_check.htm) the generic [typing](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abentyping_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the field symbol, meaning that [castings](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencast_casting_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") are allowed to specialize the generic typing but not to make it more general.

Hints

-   LIKE can be used to refer to the data objects in its own program, and also to the public attributes of global classes.

-   The standard type for generically typed field symbols specified after CASTING LIKE differs slightly from the [standard type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abentyping_generic.htm) for generic field symbols and formal parameters (length 1 not 4 if any and data are used and no standard type for generic table types).

-   If a generically typed field symbol is specified after CASTING LIKE, a memory area should be assigned to it when the statement is executed.
    

Example

Casting of a structure with three components to a time field.

DATA:
¬†¬†BEGIN OF time,
¬†¬†¬†¬†hours¬†¬† TYPE c LENGTH 2 VALUE '11',
¬†¬†¬†¬†minute¬†¬†TYPE c LENGTH 2 VALUE '55',
¬†¬†¬†¬†seconds TYPE c LENGTH 2 VALUE '00',
¬†¬†END OF time.
FIELD-SYMBOLS <fs> TYPE any.
ASSIGN time TO <fs> CASTING LIKE sy-timlo.
cl\_demo\_output=>display( <fs> ).

Addition 4

... *\[*TYPE p*\]* DECIMALS dec

Effect

A numeric data object dec must be specified after DECIMALS. The assigned memory area is cast to the data type p, where the number of [decimal places](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendecimal_place_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is determined by the content of dec. The number of decimal places must not exceed the total number of [places](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenplace_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). TYPE does not need to be specified for DECIMALS. If TYPE is used, only the data type p, which is used anyway, can be specified.

The field symbol <fs> can only be typed generically and not completely. The specified data type must [match](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abentyping_check.htm) the generic [typing](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abentyping_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the field symbol, meaning that [castings](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencast_casting_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") are allowed to specialize the generic typing but not to make it more general.

Example

The calculation of the quotient from the packed number pack and the field symbol <pack> demonstrates the effect of casting with the addition DECIMALS. Factors between 10 and 100,000,000 are determined. When using <pack> in operand positions, a different value is used than when using pack.

DATA output TYPE TABLE OF string WITH EMPTY KEY.
DATA pack¬†¬† TYPE p LENGTH 8 DECIMALS 0 VALUE '12345678'.
FIELD-SYMBOLS <pack> TYPE p.
DO 8 TIMES.
¬†¬†ASSIGN pack TO <pack> CASTING DECIMALS sy-index.
¬†¬†APPEND CONV string( pack / <pack> ) TO output.
ENDDO.
cl\_demo\_output=>display( output ).

Addition 5

... TYPE HANDLE handle

Effect

After TYPE HANDLE, a reference variable handle of the static type of the class CL\_ABAP\_DATADESCR or its subclasses is specified that points to a [type description object](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abentype_object_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the [RTTS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrun_time_type_services_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The assigned memory area is cast to the type of the field symbol.

The field symbol <fs> can only be typed generically and not completely. The specified data type must [match](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abentyping_check.htm) the generic [typing](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abentyping_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the field symbol, meaning that [castings](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencast_casting_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") are allowed to specialize the generic typing but not to make it more general.

The addition CASTING TYPE HANDLE cannot be used with the addition [RANGE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapassign_range.htm).

Hint

The type description object may have been created using the RTTS methods on existing data objects, or using the definition of a new data type.

Example

Generation of a type description object for a structure and using it to cast a date field.

DATA(struct) = cl\_abap\_structdescr=>create(
¬†¬†VALUE abap\_component\_tab(
¬†¬†¬†¬†( name = 'YEAR'¬†¬†type = cl\_abap\_elemdescr=>get\_c( p\_length = 4 ) )
¬†¬†¬†¬†( name = 'MONTH' type = cl\_abap\_elemdescr=>get\_c( p\_length = 2 ) )
¬†¬†¬†¬†( name = 'DAY'¬†¬† type = cl\_abap\_elemdescr=>get\_c( p\_length = 2 ) )
¬†¬†) ).
FIELD-SYMBOLS¬†¬†<fs> TYPE any.
ASSIGN sy-datlo TO¬†¬†<fs> CASTING TYPE HANDLE struct.
cl\_demo\_output=>display( <fs> ).

Description

An implicit casting is performed in the first part of the method main. The field symbol <fs1> is completely typed with the local program type t\_date. The field sy-datum can be handled as a structure using the addition CASTING of the statement ASSIGN. This assignment would not be possible without the CASTING addition, since sy-datum is not compatible with the type of the field symbol.

An explicit casting is performed in the second part of the method main. The field symbol <fs2> is completely generic. A cast is performed to the local program type t\_date for the field sy-datum using the addition CASTING of the statement ASSIGN. The field symbol <fs2> can now be handled like a structure but does not recognize components. For this reason, it must be assigned to another field symbol <fs3>, component by component.

Description

This example demonstrates how casting works on built-in data types. First the character string txt is assigned to the field symbol <fs> without casting. Afterwards, txt is assigned to <fs> using casting on types i and x. The second output value depends on the byte order of the current platform. The paired numbers in the last output line represent the hexadecimal code for the character in txt and depend on the character representation on the current AS instance.

The section of the method that has been commented out also shows the syntax for the relevant [obsolete casting](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapassign_casting_obsolete.htm).

Constants for Minimum and Maximum Values

The class CL\_ABAP\_MATH contains constants with the limits of the value ranges [built-in numeric types](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbuiltin_types_numeric.htm).

Example

Display of the minimum and maximum values of numeric types.

cl\_demo\_output=>display(
¬†¬†|i:¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†{ cl\_abap\_math=>min\_int4 WIDTH = 20

Operations with Floating Point Numbers

The class CL\_ABAP\_MATH contains methods for operations with floating point numbers.

Rounding Binary Floating Point Numbers

The method ROUND\_F\_TO\_15\_DECS rounds a [binary floating point number](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbinfloat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") to 15 places using commercial rounding.

Hint

Commercial rounding to 15 digits can also be achieved using the built-in function [round](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendec_floating_point_functions.htm), the result of which, however, has the decfloat34 type.

Example

The example shows how rounding errors in the output formatting of binary floating point numbers can be prevented by two-step rounding using the method ROUND\_F\_TO\_15\_DECS. Instead of the method call, the function call round( val = float dec = 15 ) can be used here.

DATA float TYPE f VALUE '1.005'.
cl\_demo\_output=>display(
¬†¬†|{ float DECIMALS = 2 }\\n| &&
¬†¬†|{ cl\_abap\_math=>round\_f\_to\_15\_decs( float ) DECIMALS = 2 }\\n| ).

Operations with Decimal Floating Point Numbers

-   The method GET\_SCALE returns the [scaling](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenscale_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of a [decimal floating point number](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendecfloat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

-   The method GET\_NUMBER\_OF\_DIGITS returns the [precision](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprecision_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of a [decimal floating point number](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendecfloat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

-   The method NORMALIZE returns a normalized floating point number. This means that the [scaling](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenscale_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and [precision](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprecision_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of an input value are changed so that the mantissa has no trailing zeros.

-   The method GET\_SCALE\_NORMALIZED returns the [scaling](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenscale_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of a normalized [decimal floating point number](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendecfloat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). If the input value has decimal places, the return value is the number of decimal places without trailing zeros.

-   The method GET\_MAX\_DB\_VALUE returns the maximum value of a number of the type DF16\_DEC or DF34\_DEC on the database.

-   The method GET\_DB\_LENGTH\_DECS returns the length and number of decimal places of a number of the type DF16\_DEC or DF34\_DEC on the database.

Hint

The [rounding functions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrounding_function_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") round and rescale can be used to round and rescale decimal floating point numbers.

Example

Display of the scaling and precision of a decimal floating point number.

DATA(decf) = CONV decfloat34( '1234.56789' ).
cl\_demo\_output=>display(
|value = { decf
}\\nscale = { cl\_abap\_math=>get\_scale( decf )
}\\nprecision = { cl\_abap\_math=>get\_number\_of\_digits( decf ) }| ).

System Class CL\_ABAP\_DECFLOAT

The system class CL\_ABAP\_DECFLOAT contains methods for handling [decimal floating point numbers](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendecfloat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

-   The methods READ\_DECFLOAT34 and READ\_DECFLOAT16 convert strings to decimal floating point numbers. The exceptions of these methods are more significant than those of a normal assignment. Furthermore, the methods return a return value that reveals information about the roundings performed.

-   The methods CONVERT\_CURR\_TO\_DECFLOAT and CONVERT\_DECFLOAT\_TO\_CURR convert currency amounts to decimal floating point numbers as specified by a currency key and vice versa.

Hint

The formatting option [CURRENCY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapwrite_to_options.htm) of the [WRITE TO](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapwrite_to.htm) and [WRITE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapwrite-.htm) statements works as the method CONVERT\_DECFLOAT\_TO\_CURR.

Random Numbers

The class CL\_ABAP\_RANDOM calls the pseudo random number generator Mersenne Twister for different numeric types.

For the one-dimensional case, the following special classes generate random numbers for the different numeric types:

-   CL\_ABAP\_RANDOM\_INT for type i

-   CL\_ABAP\_RANDOM\_INT8 for type int8

-   CL\_ABAP\_RANDOM\_FLOAT for type f

-   CL\_ABAP\_RANDOM\_PACKED for type p

-   CL\_ABAP\_RANDOM\_PACKED\_DEC1 to CL\_ABAP\_RANDOM\_PACKED\_DEC14 for type p with 1 to 14 decimal places.

-   CL\_ABAP\_RANDOM\_DECFLOAT16 for type decfloat16

-   CL\_ABAP\_RANDOM\_DECFLOAT34 for type decfloat34

Example

Creation of a pseudo random number of the type i between 1 and 100, initialized by the system time.

DATA(r) = cl\_abap\_random\_int=>create( seed = CONV i( sy-uzeit )
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†min¬†¬†= 1

Class for Trailing Blanks

The class CL\_ABAP\_STRING\_UTILITIES contains methods for processing [text strings](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abentext_string_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

-   C2STR\_PRESERVING\_BLANKS assigns text fields while preserving the trailing blanks.

-   DEL\_TRAILING\_BLANKS deletes the trailing blanks from strings.

Hint

Tasks like this can now also be performed using statements and built-in functions.

Example

The program compares the method C2STR\_PRESERVING\_BLANKS with the built-in function [shift\_right](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenshift_functions.htm). The implementation of the method now consists of nothing more than this function.

Class with Utilities for String Processing

The class CL\_ABAP\_CHAR\_UTILITIES provides attributes and methods as utilities for string processing.

The components of this class are all static and public, the attributes are read-only and are initialized in the class constructor. Details about the attributes and methods of this class are described in the class documentation.

Example

The following lines demonstrate that attributes of the class CL\_ABAP\_CHAR\_UTILITIES containing control characters can be replaced by a representation of the [control characters](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenstring_templates_separators.htm) in a [string template](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenstring_template_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") .

Methods for Handling Code Pages

The methods CONVERT of the interfaces IF\_ABAP\_CONV\_OUT and IF\_ABAP\_CONV\_IN of objects created with the class CL\_ABAP\_CONV\_CODEPAGE make it possible to convert strings to the binary representation of various code pages and vice versa.

Example

Conversion of the content of a string into its UTF-8 representation. The value "UTF-8" is the default value for the parameter CODEPAGE and can also be omitted. The statement [ASSERT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapassert.htm) shows that the reverse conversion creates the original text again.

DATA(str) = \`Blah blah ...\`.
DATA(xstr) =
¬†¬†cl\_abap\_conv\_codepage=>create\_out( codepage = \`UTF-8\`
¬†¬†¬†¬†)->convert( source = str ).
ASSERT
¬†¬†cl\_abap\_conv\_codepage=>create\_in( codepage = \`UTF-8\`
¬†¬†¬†¬†)->convert( source = xstr ) = str.

This section summarizes the use of [enumerated objects](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenenumerated_object_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), that is, data objects with [enumerated types](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenenumerated_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Executable Example

[Enumerated Objects, Use](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenenum_usage_abexa.htm)

Declaration

An enumerated object is a data object with an [enumerated type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenenumerated_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") defined by one of the following TYPES statements:

[TYPES BEGIN OF ENUM enum\_type ...](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abaptypes_enum.htm)
¬†¬†[TYPES val1 ...](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abaptypes_enum.htm)
¬†¬†[TYPES val2 ...](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abaptypes_enum.htm)
¬†¬†...
[TYPES END OF ENUM enum\_type ...](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abaptypes_enum.htm)

The technical data type of the content of an enumerated object is the [base type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbase_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the enumerated type. The possible content is defined by the [enumerated values](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenenumerated_value_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") defined using TYPES val1, TYPES val2, ..., of which exactly one value must have the type-specific initial value. The base type is i by default, but it can also be a different elementary data type. The following enumerated objects exist:

-   Enumerated variables

An [enumerated variable](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenenumerated_variable_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is a variable defined using

[DATA enum\_var TYPE enum\_type ...](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapdata_enum.htm)

that can contain only [enumerated values](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenenumerated_value_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the enumerated type. This is ensured by the ABAP runtime environment and the rules for using enumerated types.

-   Enumerated constants

An [enumerated constant](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenenumerated_constant_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is used to define a value in the value set of an enumerated type. It is defined in the definition of an enumerated type with

[TYPES val ...](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abaptypes_enum.htm)

under the name val. It is a constant of the context of its definition and contains the [enumerated value](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenenumerated_value_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") assigned in the definition. It can be specified in all read positions in which enumerated objects are possible. Its enumerated value is either determined automatically as an integer or can be specified explicitly in the definition.

-   Components of enumerated structures

A component of an [enumerated structure](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenenumerated_structure_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is a special form of an enumerated constant that exists as a component of a constant structure and not as a single data object. The enumerated structure struc is defined using

[TYPES BEGIN OF ENUM enum\_type STRUCTURE struc ...](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abaptypes_enum.htm)

This makes the enumerated constants defined using

[TYPES val ...](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abaptypes_enum.htm)

into their structure components. Otherwise, the same applies as to regular enumerated constants.

Hints

-   Enumerated objects are mainly used to check allowed values. This usually restricts the actual parameters passed to methods to the enumerated values defined in the class.

-   The base type and the actual enumerated value are almost always ignored when enumerated objects are used. Assignments and comparisons are usually only made between enumerated objects with the same enumerated type.

-   Base types other than i and the actual enumerated values may be significant in transformations between enumerated type or in migrations of previous concepts.

-   Enumerated structures can be used to avoid naming conflicts if there are multiple enumerated types in a namespace. Enumerated structures can be used to enable the use of the same enumerated constant name in multiple enumerated types.

Example

Declaration of an enumerated type size in a class. The method parameter size has the enumerated type and only enumerated objects of this type can be passed to this parameter. This example show how the enumerated constant demo=>l is passed. This guarantees that only enumerated values of the enumerated type can be passed to the parameter. These can be evaluated in comparisons with the enumerated constants. In the CASE control structure shown here, the statement block after WHEN OTHERS can be reached only when demo=>xl and demo=>xxl are passed.

¬†¬†¬†¬†ENDCASE.
¬†¬†ENDMETHOD.
ENDCLASS.

¬†¬†demo=>main( demo=>l ).

Processing of Enumerated Objects

The processing of enumerated objects is usually independent of the base type of the enumerated type. Only the enumerated type itself is relevant for all rules specified here. Assignments of enumerated objects with a numeric base type, for example, cannot be assigned to numeric target fields and cannot be compared with numeric fields. The enumerated value in the base type can be accessed using the constructor operators [CONV](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconv_constructor_enum.htm) and [EXACT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenexact_constructor_enum.htm) only.

Operand Positions for Enumerated Objects

-   Read positions

Enumerated objects can be used in all [read positions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendata_objects_usage_reading.htm) in which the operand type is their enumerated type or in which the operand is converted to one of the character-like types c or string. [Substring access](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenoffset_length.htm) is not possible.

-   Write positions

Enumerated variables can only be used in [write positions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendata_objects_usage_writing.htm) in which the operand type is the enumerated type and only the associated enumerated values can be written. If known statically, an attempt to assign a value other than a valid enumerated value to an enumerated variable produces a syntax error. If not known statically, an exception is raised.

Example

In the first assignment, the enumerated constant xl in a read position is assigned to the enumerated variable size in a write position. The string expression in the second half exploits the fact that the enumerated constants are converted implicitly to the type string before the concatenation. The result is SMLXLXXL.

TYPES:
¬†¬†BEGIN OF ENUM size,
¬†¬†¬†¬†s, m, l, xl, xxl,
¬†¬†END OF ENUM size.
DATA size TYPE size.
size = xl.
DATA(str) = s && m && l && xl && xxl.

Value Assignments

Only enumerated objects with the same enumerated type can be assigned to an enumerated variable. In the assignment, the target field is given the enumerated value of the source field.

The initial value of the base type is always a valid enumerated value of an enumerated type. Accordingly, an enumerated variable can be set to the initial value of its base type using [CLEAR](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapclear.htm). Assignments of [VALUE enum\_type( )](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenvalue_constructor_params_init.htm) are also possible.

Conversely, enumerated objects can only be assigned to compatible enumerated variables, with the following exception: There is a [conversion rule](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconversion_enumerated.htm) for assignments of enumerated objects to character-like variables of the types c and string. In this case, the target field is assigned the name of the enumerated constant or the component of the enumerated structure under which the enumerated value of the source field is defined in the enumerated type. Since this rule can produce unexpected results, conversions of this type lead to a message from the extended program check that can be hidden using the pragma ##types.

In structures, each component with an enumerated type forms a separate fragment of the [structure fragment view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenunicode_fragment_view.htm). In assignments between structures of this type, the fragment views must match so that only components with the same enumerated type can be assigned to each other.

Example

In the first assignment, the enumerated constant sz-xl is assigned to the enumerated variable size of its enumerated type. This variable then contains the associated enumerated value 3. In the second assignment, the enumerated constant is assigned to the text string size\_string. This string is given the value XL in accordance with the conversion rule.

TYPES:
¬†¬†BEGIN OF ENUM size STRUCTURE sz,
¬†¬†¬†¬†s, m, l, xl, xxl,
¬†¬†END OF ENUM size STRUCTURE sz.
DATA size TYPE size.
size = sz-xl.
DATA size\_string TYPE string.
size\_string = sz-xl.

Comparisons

For comparisons between enumerated objects, the [comparison rule](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenlogexp_rules_operands_enum.htm) applies that an enumerated object can only be compared with an enumerated object with the same enumerated type. Here, the values of the operands are compared in accordance with their base type.

Each enumerated type has an initial enumerated value, which makes checks with the predicate expression [IS INITIAL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenlogexp_initial.htm) possible.

Hint

Comparisons do not perform an implicit conversion of an enumerated object to the character-like types c and string. Conversions of this type must be performed explicitly, for example with the conversion operator [CONV](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconstructor_expression_conv.htm). This difference between assignments and comparisons is particularly significant when reading from internal tables using the statement [READ TABLE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapread_table.htm) or [table expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abentable_expression_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and the statement [LOOP AT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abaploop_at_itab_variants.htm) or a [FOR](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenfor_itab.htm) statement. When individual lines are read, the comparison fields of conditions are converted implicitly; this is not the case when multiple lines are read. Implicit conversions produce the message from the extended program check mentioned above.

Example

The first comparison shows a typical case where an enumerated variable is compared with an enumerated constant. The syntax of the second comparison that is in a comment is not possible. In the third comparison, the enumerated variable is converted explicitly to the type string before the comparison with a text string.

TYPES:
¬†¬†BEGIN OF ENUM size,
¬†¬†¬†¬†s, m, l, xl, xxl,
¬†¬†END OF ENUM size.
DATA size TYPE size.
...
IF size = xl.
ENDIF.
"IF size = \`XL\`. "<--- Syntax error
"ENDIF.
IF CONV string( size ) = \`XL\`.
ENDIF.

Typing of Formal Parameters and Field Symbols

If [formal parameters](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenformal_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of procedures or [field symbols](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenfield_symbol_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") are [typed](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abentyping.htm) with an enumerated type, only enumerated objects with the same enumerated type can be assigned to them. As usual, an exception to this are return values of functional methods that can also be converted to character-like objects of the types c and string.

Enumerated types are covered by the generic types [any](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbuilt_in_types_generic.htm), [data](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbuilt_in_types_generic.htm), and [simple](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbuilt_in_types_generic.htm). When an enumerated object is passed to generically typed formal parameters or in assignments to generically typed field symbols, they inherit the enumerated type. In assignments to field symbols, no castings with the [CASTING](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapassign_casting.htm) addition can be performed and an enumerated type cannot be specified after this addition.

When generically typed formal parameters or field symbols are used for enumerated objects, the restriction applies that only statically known operands with the same [enumerated type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenenumerated_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") are allowed in [read positions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenreading_position_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in which an [enumerated object](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenenumerated_object_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is expected to be known statically. This affects, for example, the source field of an assignment to an [enumerated variable](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenenumerated_variable_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or an operand that is compared with an enumerated object. In [write positions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenwriting_position_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") for enumerated objects, however, generic formal parameters or field symbols are allowed for enumerated types. If the operand type is not known statically, the check is only made at runtime in read positions as well.

Example

The field symbol fs1 typed generically with simple cannot be assigned to an enumerated variable size known statically or compared with it. An assignment of size to the field symbol and fully generic handling is, however, possible.

TYPES:
¬†¬†BEGIN OF ENUM size,
¬†¬†¬†¬†s, m, l, xl, xxl,
¬†¬†END OF ENUM size.
FIELD-SYMBOLS <fs1> TYPE simple.
FIELD-SYMBOLS <fs2> TYPE simple.
DATA(size) = xl.
ASSIGN size TO <fs1>.
ASSIGN size TO <fs2>.
<fs1> = size.
"size = <fs1>.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†"<--- Syntax error
"ASSERT size = <fs1>. "<--- Syntax error
<fs2> = <fs1>.
ASSERT <fs1> = <fs2>.

Access to the Enumerated Value

A special [rule](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconv_constructor_enum.htm) for the conversion operator [CONV](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconstructor_expression_conv.htm) applies when accessing the enumerated value of an enumerated object:

[... CONV base\_type( enum\_dobj ) ...](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconv_constructor_enum.htm)

If the base type base\_type of an enumerated object enum\_dobj specified as an argument is specified directly or indirectly, CONV returns its enumerated value.

Conversely, a valid enumerated value can be converted to an enumerated object:

[... CONV enum\_type( dobj ) ...](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconv_constructor_enum.htm)

The argument dobj is converted to the base type of the enumerated type enum\_type and CONV returns an enumerated object with this value. Any invalid values raise an exception.

In combinations of these two variants where CONV base\_type( enum\_dobj ) is used as an argument dobj of CONV enum\_type( dobj ), there is a short form:

[... CONV enum\_type( enum\_dobj ) ...](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconv_constructor_enum.htm)

Provided that different enumerated types can have the same base type, an enumerated object of an enumerated type can be converted to the corresponding enumerated object of a different enumerated type.

Hint

The corresponding [rules](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenexact_constructor_enum.htm) applies to the lossless operator [EXACT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconstructor_expression_exact.htm), whereby additional losslessness checks are made.

Example

The inner conversion operator CONV accesses the current enumerated value of the enumerated object size and returns it in the type i. The outer conversion operator CONV converts the result of the addition back to an enumerated type and assigns this enumerated value to the enumerated variable size. The enumerated value in size is raised by one for each iteration. The final result is the value of the enumerated constant xxl.

TYPES:
¬†¬†BEGIN OF ENUM size,
¬†¬†¬†¬†s, m, l, xl, xxl,
¬†¬†END OF ENUM size.
DATA size TYPE size.
DO 4 TIMES.
¬†¬†size = CONV #( CONV i( size ) + 1 ).
ENDDO.

Type Descriptions

The type returned by the statement [DESCRIBE FIELD](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapdescribe_field.htm) for an enumerated object is k. The length is the length of the enumerated values in the basis type in bytes.

In [RTTS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrun_time_type_services_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), enumerated objects are described by objects of the class CL\_ABAP\_ENUMDESCR. This class can be used for [RTTI](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrun_time_type_identific_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and [RTTC](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrun_time_type_creation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") purposes. Like any enumerated type, an enumerated type created using RTTC is only compatible with itself.

The following attributes exist in a type description of the class CL\_ABAP\_ENUMDESCR:

-   KIND always has the value E for the elementary base type

-   TYPE\_KIND always has the value k as in the statement DESCRIBE FIELD

-   BASE\_TYPE\_KIND describes the base type

-   MEMBERS is a table of the enumerated constants and the associated enumerated values

Data Interfaces

The following data interfaces support enumerated types:

The character-like representation of enumerated objects, that is, the result of a c or string, is used for their output and serialization. The output consists of the name with a maximum of thirty characters of the enumerated constant of the current enumerated value in uppercase. Deserializations are performed in the reverse direction. The following are supported:

-   [Data clusters](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendata_cluster_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") with the statements [EXPORT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapexport_data_cluster.htm) and [IMPORT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapimport_data_cluster.htm). When an enumerated object is exported, the enumerated value is stored in the base type and flagged as an enumerated value. Enumerated objects and exported data objects of the base type can be imported to a suitable enumerated object (the value is checked here). No exported enumerated objects, however, can be imported to data objects of the base type.

-   [ABAP file interface](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenfile_interface_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") with the statements [TRANSFER](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abaptransfer.htm) and [READ DATASET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapread_dataset.htm). In writes and reads to and from a file, enumerated objects are handled like data objects of their base type. In reads from a file to an enumerated object, the system checks whether it is a valid enumerated value.

-   Serializations and deserializations from and to [XML](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenxml_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and [JSON](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenjson_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The formats [asXML](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_xslt_asxml_enum.htm) and [asJSON](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_asjson_abap_types_enum.htm) represent the content of enumerated objects in their character-like representation, that is, the name of the enumerated constant of the current enumerated value. Only valid names are allowed in deserializations to an enumerated object.

-   List output with the statement [WRITE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapwrite-.htm). Like [WRITE TO](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapwrite_to.htm), this statement converts an enumerated object to its character-like representation, that is, the name of the enumerated constant of the current enumerated value. The [output length](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenwrite_output_length.htm) corresponds to the maximum length of the name of 30 characters.

Hint

A deserialization of a name of an enumerated constant is one of the few ways of creating an enumerated value from the name completely dynamically.

Example

WRITE output of the enumerated constants of an enumerated structure.

TYPES:
¬†¬†BEGIN OF ENUM size STRUCTURE sz,
¬†¬†¬†¬†s, m, l, xl, xxl,
¬†¬†END OF ENUM size STRUCTURE sz.
WHILE sy-subrc = 0.
¬†¬†ASSIGN COMPONENT sy-index OF STRUCTURE sz TO FIELD-SYMBOL(<fs>).
¬†¬†IF sy-subrc = 0.
¬†¬†¬†¬†WRITE / <fs>.
¬†¬†ENDIF.
ENDWHILE.

Executable Example

[Enumerated Objects, Deserialization](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenenum_deserialization_abexa.htm)

Forbidden Uses

The following uses are forbidden to ensure that an enumerated object always only contains a single valid enumerated value:

-   Within ABAP, enumerated objects are never interpreted in accordance with their base type. This means that they cannot be used in operand positions that expect numeric, character-like, or byte-like data types. The only exception to this are the operand positions in which an implicit conversion to a character-like type takes place.

-   Enumerated types are not currently supported by the [ABAP Dictionary](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_dictionary.htm). Accordingly, no database tables whose columns have an enumerated type can be defined in the ABAP Dictionary.

-   In both ABAP SQL and Native SQL ([EXEC SQL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapexec.htm), [ADBC](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenadbc_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")), no [host variables](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_variable_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or references to ABAP variables with enumerated type can be used. The actual parameters of [AMDP methods](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenamdp_method_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") cannot be typed using enumerated types.

-   No enumerated types are supported for the input fields of [selection screens](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenselection_screen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

-   It is not possible to copy enumerated values from [lists in the list buffer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_lists_complex.htm), since there are no conversion rules between character-like types and enumerated types.

If an enumerated object is provided with an invalid value due to a gap in the rules, this results in the following behavior:

-   The result of a conversion to c or string is the string <illegal enum value>, which is displayed accordingly in the ABAP Debugger.

-   An enumerated object with an invalid value can be assigned to other enumerated objects with the same enumerated type without being checked.

-   The expressions [CONV base\_type( enum\_dobj )](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconv_constructor_enum.htm) and [EXACT base\_type( enum\_dobj )](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenexact_constructor_enum.htm) return the invalid value.

An invalid value is to be regarded as an error and should never occur.

Hint

Classic [Dynpros](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendynpro_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") represent a known gap. Enumerated types are not supported by dynpros. If dynpro input fields are copied from a program by using enumerated objects, they are handled like an object of the base type. Any invalid values are passed to the associated enumerated object at the event [PAI](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenpai_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") without being checked. For this reason, enumerated objects should never be associated with classic dynpros.

Example

The program DEMO\_ENUM\_DYNPRO uses an enumerated object on a dynpro. This can produce invalid values in the program.

Description

The program calls the method SHOW of class CL\_DEMO\_WRAP\_BROWSER . Two enumerated types are defined as follows in this class:

TYPES:
¬†¬†BEGIN OF ENUM size STRUCTURE sz,
¬†¬†¬†¬†s, m, l, xl,
¬†¬†END OF ENUM size STRUCTURE sz.
TYPES:
¬†¬†BEGIN OF ENUM format STRUCTURE fmt,
¬†¬†¬†¬†l, p,
¬†¬†END OF ENUM format STRUCTURE fmt.

The use of [enumerated structures](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenenumerated_structure_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") means that the same name l can occur twice. The method SHOW wraps the method SHOW\_HTML of the class CL\_ABAP\_BROWSER:

METHOD show.
¬†¬†cl\_abap\_browser=>show\_html(
¬†¬†¬†¬†html\_string = html
¬†¬†¬†¬†size¬†¬†¬†¬†= SWITCH #(¬†¬†size
¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† WHEN sz-s¬†¬†THEN cl\_abap\_browser=>small
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† WHEN sz-m¬†¬†THEN cl\_abap\_browser=>medium
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† WHEN sz-l¬†¬†THEN cl\_abap\_browser=>large
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† WHEN sz-xl THEN cl\_abap\_browser=>xlarge )
¬†¬†¬†¬†format¬†¬†= SWITCH #(¬†¬†format
¬†¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† WHEN fmt-l THEN cl\_abap\_browser=>landscape
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† WHEN fmt-p THEN cl\_abap\_browser=>portrait )
¬†¬†¬†¬†buttons = abap\_true ).
ENDMETHOD.

The input parameters size and format format of the method have the identically named enumerated types and can only contain their enumerated values. These are mapped to the corresponding constants of class CL\_ABAP\_BROWSER. These constants are to be regarded as a workaround for real enumerated types, which did not exist when CL\_ABAP\_BROWSER was developed.

Enumerated values can be entered for the size and format when the program is executed. The internal transfer to the program takes place by deserializing the character-like values into the local enumerated variables size and format. The exception for invalid values is caught internally, whereby the enumerated variables are initialized, which corresponds to the values of the enumerated constants sz-s and fmt-l.

Description

A byte string is composed in such a way that it represents an XML file in asXML format for an enumerated object of the enumerated type size and is deserialized as such. Any invalid entries raise an exception.

Next, the dynamic assignment of a name to a field symbol is displayed. This is successful but the prerequisite here is that the enumerated type size is known in the current context. However, the XML file can be deserialized in an enumerated object without static knowledge of the enumerated type.

-   [Prerequisites for the Optimization of Sorted Keys](#abenitab-where-optimization-2--------requirements-made-on-the-operands---@ITOC@@ABENITAB_WHERE_OPTIMIZATION_3)

Hint

If the lines selected using WHERE are modified or deleted using [MODIFY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmodify_itab.htm) or [DELETE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapdelete_itab.htm) and not just read using [LOOP AT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abaploop_at_itab.htm), further update costs are incurred in addition to the search for the lines. When deleting lines from standard tables, it should be noted that searches using a secondary key optimize the selection of lines to be deleted, but not the update required for the primary key, which is usually performed using a linear search.

Prerequisites for the Optimization of Hash Keys

In the case of [hash key](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhash_key_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") accesses, there must be exactly one relational expression joined using AND for each component of the key. This expression is either

-   a [comparison expression](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencomparison_expression_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") with the comparison operator \= (or EQ), whose operands meet the requirements above or

-   a [predicate expression](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenpredicate_expression_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") IS INITIAL without the addition NOT.

These relational expressions construct the part of the logical expression used for the key access. This part must not contain duplicate key components. The remaining logical expression can contain any number of relational expressions joined using AND. Optimization may not be possible, however, if the Boolean operator NOT or an OR join is used. Key components may be used in the relational expressions not used for the key access.

Hint

Relational expressions other than comparisons using \= (or EQ) or predicate expressions IS INITIAL do not contribute to the key access. This applies particularly to the tabular comparison operator [IN range\_tab](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenlogexp_select_option.htm), even if it can be traced back to optimizable comparisons.

Example

In the following example, the first two WHERE conditions can be optimized as key accesses with the secondary table key key. This is because:

1.  The optimizable conditions for b, d, and e cover the entire key.
    
2.  The optimizable conditions b, d, and e cover the entire key and a is a condition on a non-key column that is not involved in the part of the WHERE condition required for the optimization.
    
3.  The optimizable conditions b, d, and e cover the entire key and the other two conditions on the key columns b and d are not optimizable and are hence not involved in the part of the WHERE condition required for the optimization.
    

The next six WHERE conditions cannot be optimized and produce syntax errors. This is because:

1.  The key component d is not specified.
    
2.  A key component is joined using OR instead of AND.
    
3.  Two non-optimizable comparison operators are used.
    
4.  An operand of type i is used in the comparison b of type c, which does not meet the requirements made on the operands.
    
5.  The Boolean operator NOT is used in front of a key component.
    
6.  A further comparison is joined using OR.
    
7.  A further comparison is negated using NOT.

Prerequisites for the Optimization of Sorted Keys

In the case of reads using a [sorted key](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abensorted_key_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), the same applies as to a hash key. The only difference is that only an initial section of the key consisting of at least one component needs to be covered rather than the entire key.

The internal table is accessed partially sequentially. The starting point for the processing of the table is determined by a binary search using the subconditions that cover the table key completely or partially. From the starting point onwards, the table is only processed for as long as these subconditions remain fulfilled.

Example

In the following example, the first five WHERE conditions can be optimized as key accesses with the secondary table key key. This is because:

1.  b is an initial part of the key.
    
2.  b is an initial part of the key and a is an independent condition.
    
3.  b and e are an initial part of the key.
    
4.  b, e, and d are an initial part of the key and the order in the WHERE condition is ignored.
    
5.  b is an initial part of the key and in this case, d is an independent condition, even though it is part of the key.
    

The next five WHERE conditions cannot be optimized and produce syntax errors. This is because:

1.  e is not an initial part of the key.
    
2.  No inequality comparison takes place.
    
3.  A comparison in a ranges table is specified.
    
4.  The Boolean operator NOT is used.
    
5.  An additional OR relationship is used.

Requirements Made on the Operands

The part of the logical expression that can be mapped to a key access must select the same lines as a statement [READ TABLE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapread_table.htm) or a corresponding [table expression](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abentable_expressions.htm) that specifies the corresponding components as keys.

-   When comparing incompatible data objects, the WHERE condition is subject to the same [comparison rules](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenlogexp_rules.htm) for incompatible data types. Here, the data types involved determine which operand is converted to which comparison type.

-   If the additions [WITH TABLE KEY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapread_table_key.htm) and [WITH KEY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapread_table_free.htm) of the statement READ or [KEY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abentable_exp_itab_line.htm) in a table expression are used, however, the content of the specified data objects is always converted to the data type of the columns before the comparison.

If this produces differing results, an optimization is not possible. Due to the complexity of the comparison rules, particularly for [elementary data types](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenlogexp_rules_operands.htm), it is not a good idea to construct a set of rules detailing exactly when the comparison type matches the data type of the left operand. Generally speaking,

-   only fully compatible operands are optimizable,

-   in some cases, elementary operands with different data types can be optimized, if the value ranges or lengths are suitable. For example, a comparison of a column with the type of a floating point number with an operand of type integer or of a column of c with a similar operand, if its length is less than the length of the column.

For this reason, it is advisable to use only pairs of [compatible](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencompatible_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") operands in the WHERE condition. This guarantees that the differences in behavior of the WHERE condition and the specified key do not affect the result.

Example

The following example is largely similar to the example in the section WHERE log\_exp in [LOOP AT itab](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abaploop_at_itab_cond.htm). In that case, access takes place using the primary key and no optimization. Here, however, access takes place using a secondary table key and a syntax check warning is produced and an exception raised when the program is executed. The number of lines in the internal table determines whether the exception is raised.

Runtime Type Services (RTTS)

The [RTTS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrun_time_type_services_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") are implemented using a hierarchy of [type description classes](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abentype_class_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that contain the methods for [Runtime Type Creation (RTTC)](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrun_time_type_creation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and [Runtime Type Identification (RTTI)](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrun_time_type_identific_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). Using these system classes, it is possible to

-   determine type information of existing [instances](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeninstance_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and [type names](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abentype_names.htm) in the [ABAP type system](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abentypes_objects_oview.htm) at runtime.

-   define new data types at runtime.

Concept

The properties of the types are represented by the attributes of [type description objects](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abentype_object_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). For each type there is exactly one type description object. The attributes of the type description object contain information about the properties of the type. For each type category (elementary type, table, class, and so on), there is a type description class with special attributes for the special type properties. The class hierarchy of the type description classes corresponds to the hierarchy of the type categories in the [ABAP type system](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abentypes_objects_oview.htm).

In addition, type description classes for complex types, references, classes, and interfaces have special methods for determining references to partial types. These methods can be used can navigate to all partial types using a composite type.

Type description objects can only be created using the methods of type description classes. To get a reference to a type description object of a type, the static methods of the class CL\_ABAP\_TYPEDESCR can be used or methods of the special type description classes can be called.

Hint

In the statement [CREATE DATA](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcreate_data.htm), type description objects can be specified after the addition [HANDLE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcreate_data_handle.htm) to create data objects with dynamically created data types.

Example

Reading of the type attributes of an elementary type from a type object generated with the method DESCRIBE\_BY\_DATA.

TYPES my\_type TYPE p LENGTH 16 DECIMALS 6.
DATA¬†¬†my\_data TYPE my\_type.
DATA(descr) = cl\_abap\_typedescr=>describe\_by\_data( my\_data ).
cl\_demo\_output=>display(
¬†¬†|Typename: { descr->absolute\_name }\\n| &&
¬†¬†|Kind:¬†¬†¬†¬† { descr->type\_kind¬†¬†¬†¬† }\\n| &&
¬†¬†|Length:¬†¬† { descr->length¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†}\\n| &&
¬†¬†|Decimals: { descr->decimals¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†}\\n| ).

Example

Reading of the attributes of the components of a structure. The reference to the type object is assigned using a down cast to a reference variable of type CL\_ABAP\_STRUCTDESCR.

cl\_demo\_output=>display( CAST cl\_abap\_structdescr(
¬†¬†cl\_abap\_typedescr=>describe\_by\_name( 'SYST' ) )->components ).

Runtime Type Services (RTTS)

The [RTTS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrun_time_type_services_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") are implemented using a hierarchy of [type description classes](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abentype_class_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that contain the methods for [Runtime Type Creation (RTTC)](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrun_time_type_creation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and [Runtime Type Identification (RTTI)](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrun_time_type_identific_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). Using these system classes, it is possible to

-   determine type information of existing [instances](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeninstance_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and [type names](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abentype_names.htm) in the [ABAP type system](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abentypes_objects_oview.htm) at runtime.

-   define new data types at runtime.

Concept

The properties of the types are represented by the attributes of [type description objects](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abentype_object_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). For each type there is exactly one type description object. The attributes of the type description object contain information about the properties of the type. For each type category (elementary type, table, class, and so on), there is a type description class with special attributes for the special type properties. The class hierarchy of the type description classes corresponds to the hierarchy of the type categories in the [ABAP type system](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abentypes_objects_oview.htm).

In addition, type description classes for complex types, references, classes, and interfaces have special methods for determining references to partial types. These methods can be used can navigate to all partial types using a composite type.

Type description objects can only be created using the methods of type description classes. To get a reference to a type description object of a type, the static methods of the class CL\_ABAP\_TYPEDESCR can be used or methods of the special type description classes can be called.

Hint

In the statement [CREATE DATA](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcreate_data.htm), type description objects can be specified after the addition [HANDLE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcreate_data_handle.htm) to create data objects with dynamically created data types.

Example

Reading of the type attributes of an elementary type from a type object generated with the method DESCRIBE\_BY\_DATA.

TYPES my\_type TYPE p LENGTH 16 DECIMALS 6.
DATA¬†¬†my\_data TYPE my\_type.
DATA(descr) = cl\_abap\_typedescr=>describe\_by\_data( my\_data ).
cl\_demo\_output=>display(
¬†¬†|Typename: { descr->absolute\_name }\\n| &&
¬†¬†|Kind:¬†¬†¬†¬† { descr->type\_kind¬†¬†¬†¬† }\\n| &&

¬†¬†|Decimals: { descr->decimals¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†}\\n| ).

Example

Reading of the attributes of the components of a structure. The reference to the type object is assigned using a down cast to a reference variable of type CL\_ABAP\_STRUCTDESCR.

cl\_demo\_output=>display( CAST cl\_abap\_structdescr(
¬†¬†cl\_abap\_typedescr=>describe\_by\_name( 'SYST' ) )->components ).

Automatic Authorization Checks

The following authorization checks take place automatically when data is accessed:

-   [Authorization Check in the Operating System](#abenfile-interface-authority-1--------authorization-checks-for-special-files---@ITOC@@ABENFILE_INTERFACE_AUTHORITY_2)

-   [Authorization Object S\_DATASET](#abenfile-interface-authority-3--------database-table-spth-and-authorization-object-s--path---@ITOC@@ABENFILE_INTERFACE_AUTHORITY_4)

Authorization Check in the Operating System

From the point of view of the operating system on the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of a AS instance, all files are accessed from [AS ABAP](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenas_abap_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). As a consequence, the user of the operating system that creates an instance of the [AS ABAP](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenas_abap_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") AS instance must have the authority to read and write to all files and directories that are handled by the ABAP file interface. If this authorization does not exist, the file interface statements can only be partially carried out, or not at all. If a statement cannot be executed because of lack of authorization in the operating system, the return value sy-subrc is set to not equal to 0.

Authorization Checks for Special Files

Every time a PSE file (file with the extension .pse for a Personal Security Environment) is accessed, an automatic authorization check for the current user is performed with the value "01" for the field ACTVT of the authorization object S\_RZL\_ADM of the system administrator.

Authorization Object S\_DATASET

An authorization check is performed for the current user each time a file is opened or deleted using the following:

-   [OPEN DATASET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset.htm)

-   [DELETE DATASET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapdelete_dataset.htm)

Also, the current program is executed using the predefined authorization object S\_DATASET. This authorization object contains the authorization fields PROGRAM for the program names, FILENAME for the opened files, and ACTVT with the activities Delete, Read, Write, Read with Filter, and Write with Filter. If the user or program does not have the necessary authorization, a catchable exception of the class CX\_SY\_FILE\_AUTHORITY is raised. To avoid this, the function module AUTHORITY\_CHECK\_DATASET can be called before the relevant ABAP statement to check whether the authorization exists.

Hint

In the authorization check with the authorization object S\_DATASET, the [physical file name](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenphysical_filename_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") used in the statements above and the values of the authorization field FILENAME are subject to a literal comparison. Any relative paths specified are not transformed to absolute paths. To avoid unexpected results, it is best to specify only absolute paths in physical file names.

Database Table SPTH and Authorization Object S\_PATH

An automatic check is made when the following statements access files:

-   [OPEN DATASET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset.htm)

-   [DELETE DATASET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapdelete_dataset.htm)

This check is made on entries in the database tables SPTH. The entries in the database table SPTH control the general read and write accesses from ABAP programs to files and whether files should be backed up or not.

In the database table SPTH, reads and writes can be forbidden on all files specified absolutely or relatively, regardless of the [authorization objects](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenauthorization_object_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). For the remaining files (those that are generally allowed to be accessed for read or write according to the database table SPTH), authorization checks can be carried out on the basis of authorization objects. In the database table SPTH, authorization groups from the table SPTHB (texts in SPTHT, shared view V\_SPT) for program-independent authorization checks can be defined. The following table shows the columns of the database table SPTH. If the check on the database table SPTH has a negative result, a catchable exception of the class CX\_SY\_FILE\_AUTHORITY is raised.

Column

Meaning

PATH

Absolute or relative path specified for directory names or file names. The content specified in the other columns of this row applies to all the files of the AS instance that are best described by the entry in this column.

SAVEFLAG

The value "X" in this column can be evaluated by backups. The ABAP runtime environment does not itself make any backups.

FS\_NOREAD

If this column contains the value "X", the files specified in the column PATH cannot be accessed from ABAP. This setting overrides the setting in the columns FS\_NOWRITE and FS\_BRGRU as well as the authorization check on the authorization object S\_DATASET.

FS\_NOWRITE

If this column contains the value "X", writes cannot be performed on the files specified in the column PATH from ABAP. This setting overrides the setting in the column FS\_BRGRU as well as the authorization check on the authorization object S\_DATASET.

FS\_BRGRU

In this column, an authorization group can be specified that is defined in the table SPTHB. The files of multiple rows can be grouped together in this way. When the database table SPTH is evaluated, an authorization check for the current user is made against the authorization object S\_PATH (which contains an authorization field FS\_BRGRU and an authorization field ACTVT with the possible values "03" (Display), "02" (Change), "A6" (Display with Addition [FILTER](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_os_addition.htm) ), and "A7" (Change with Addition [FILTER](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_os_addition.htm)). This makes it possible to grant access to the files specified in PATH to specific users. If no authorization group is entered, no authorization check is made against the authorization object S\_PATH.

In the paths specified in the column PATH, placeholders can be specified for specific [profile parameters](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or for the current [client](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenclient_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"):

... <P=name> ...

When evaluated, a placeholder is replaced by the value of the profile parameter specified in name or by the current [client ID](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenclient_identifier_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The possible values for name are specified in the documentation of the table SPTH.

When a file is accessed using the statements [OPEN DATASET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset.htm) and [DELETE DATASET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapdelete_dataset.htm), a [physical file name](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenphysical_filename_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is used. When the content of the database table SPTH is transformed, a check is made to see whether the physical file name starts with an entry in the column PATH and the row with the longest matching path is used. Before the check, a specified path in the physical file name is standardized as follows:

-   Any ../ segments are removed. For example, a path specified as /tmp/sub1/../sub2/file is transformed to /tmp/sub2/file.

-   If the operating system is not an MS Windows operating system, the / characters are converted to \\ characters and all letters are changed to uppercase letters.

If no matching path is specified in the column PATH, the row is used in which the column PATH contains the entry "\*". If this entry does not exist either, no automatic authorization check is made.

The character "\*" in the column PATH is relevant only if it is the only character entered here. When specified within paths, is subject to literal comparisons and is not used as a wildcard character.

Hints

-   In comparison to the authorization check using the authorization object S\_DATASET (see above), an authorization check using the authorization object S\_PATH is independent of the ABAP program in which it occurs.

-   Paths specified in the column PATH should usually exist in a standardized form.

-   When the path specified is standardized to a physical file name, any relative paths specified are not transformed to absolute paths. Any links and any other changeable information are not resolved.

-   The comparison rule for a path specified in the column PATH with a physical file name used to access a file is both literal and (due to the check on whether the initial segment matches) generic too. The following aspects should be noted to avoid unexpected results:

-   The character "\*" only has a special function if it is the only character in the column PATH.

-   The table SPTH should always contain an entry with the value "\*" for the column PATH. This entry is used whenever no other entries match.

-   The names of directories should always be closed with the character "/". If this is not the case, a path specified as "/tmp" in the column PATH specifies all files and directories that start with "/tmp" (like "/tmpxxx") and not just the directory "/tmp/".

-   A path specified in the column PATH is not unique. It can contain hard links and soft links. Mount points, network paths, etc. can also be specified. This means the following must be noted:

-   A combination of paths specified in the column PATH with values "X" in the columns FS\_NOREAD and FS\_NOWRITE defines non-user-specific blacklists of forbidden paths. The access rights are not necessarily unique, which makes them difficult to delimit sufficiently.

-   A combination of paths specified in the column PATH with authorization groups in the column FS\_BRGRU defines whitelists of valid paths for authorized users. In this case, the lack of uniqueness of the access rights is not critical.

For this reason, is recommended that the authorization groups in the column FS\_BRGRU and the authorization object S\_PATH are used instead of the columns FS\_NOREAD and FS\_NOWRITE.

-   Unlike in an authorization check using the authorization object S\_PATH, checks made on the columns FS\_NOREAD and FS\_NOWRITE are not made as part of the general [authorization concept](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbc_authority_check.htm) and none of the associated log entries are written.

-   For compatibility reasons, even empty values are accepted for the activity when the authorization object S\_PATH is checked, which means that files can be opened using the addition [FILTER](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_os_addition.htm).

-   The column SAVEFLAG, used for backups, should only be used together with a value in another column, preferably FS\_BRGRU. If not, no authorization check is made on files covered by the path specified in PATH.

Example

The table SPTH is filled as follows:

PATH

SAVEFLAG

FS\_NOREAD

FS\_NOWRITE

FS\_BRGRU

\*

\-

\-

\-

SUPR

/

\-

\-

\-

ROOT

\-

\-

UDAT

/tmp/sub/data/work/

\-

\-

\-

UWRK

/tmp/sub/prefix

\-

\-

\-

UPRE

These entries have the following effects:

-   Every user can make reads and writes on files in the directory /dir\_open and its subdirectories, since no restrictions are entered.

-   Only users with an authorization for the authorization group UWRK can access files in the directory /tmp/sub/data/work/ and its subdirectories.

-   Only users with an authorization for the authorization group UDAT can access files in the directory /tmp/sub/data/ and its subdirectories (with the exception of /tmp/sub/data/work/). Instead, an authorization for the authorization group UWRK is required for /tmp/sub/data/work/.

-   Users with an authorization for the authorization group UPRE can access not just those files in the directory /tmp/sub whose names start with prefix but also all files in subdirectories whose names start with /tmp/sub/prefix. If restricted access to files in a subdirectory /tmp/sub/prefix is required, the entry made in PATH must be closed using "/".

-   User with an authorization for the authorization group ROOT can access files in any directory, as long as the physical file name is specified with "/" at the start or is absolute.

-   Users with an authorization for the authorization group SUPR can access files in any directories specified as relative directories as long as the directories are not specified with "/" at the start.

Example

The table SPTH is filled as follows:

PATH

SAVEFLAG

FS\_NOREAD

FS\_NOWRITE

FS\_BRGRU

\*

\-

X

X

\-

/

\-

\-

\-

ROOT

/tmp/

\-

\-

\-

\-

/tmp/myfiles/

\-

\-

\-

FILE

The entries have the following properties:

-   The entries in the first row apply to all fields on the AS instance except for those in the paths /, /tmp/, and their subdirectories.

-   The entries in the second row apply to all fields on the AS instance in the path / except for the files in the path /tmp and its subdirectories.

-   The entries in the third row apply to all fields on the AS instance in the path /tmp except for the files in the path /tmp/myfiles and its subdirectories.

-   The entries in the fourth row apply to the fields in the path /tmp/myfiles and its subdirectories.

The entries dictate that no user can make reads or writes on files specified using relative paths. Users with authorization for the authorization group ROOT can access all files specified using absolute paths except for the files in the path /tmp/myfiles. All users can make both reads and writes on the files in the path /tmp. Only users who have an authorization for the authorization group FILE can make reads and writes on the files in the path /tmp/myfiles. When the table above is applied, this means that the following program lines produce a runtime error for all users except those with authorization for the authorization group ROOT,

DATA fname TYPE string.
fname = \`/system/files\`.
OPEN DATASET fname FOR OUTPUT IN BINARY MODE.

This configuration forbids the use of any relative paths when files are accessed. This rule is generally only advisable if this behavior is explicitly required.

-   All allowed paths should be specified in the table SPTH and associated with the appropriate authorization groups.

-   Access to the path specified as "\* should also be subject to an authorization group allowing access using any relative paths for authorized users.

Validation of File Names

Alongside the [automatic authorization checks](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenfile_interface_authority.htm), it may be necessary to validate file names before they are used to prevent [directory traversals](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendirectory_traversal_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). This is particularly important if

-   the automatic authorization checks are not enough, for example because the database table SPTH or the authorizations for the authorization object S\_DATASET have not been defined in full.

-   programs with [physical file names](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenphysical_filename_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") are used, and these file names are provided using external interfaces such as APIs or UIs.

However if logical file names are consistently used, there is no need for validation.

-   [Using Logical File Names](#abendataset-auth-self-1--------using-physical-file-names---@ITOC@@ABENDATASET_AUTH_SELF_2)

-   [Self-Programmed Validation](#abendataset-auth-self-3--------validation-with-logical-file-names---@ITOC@@ABENDATASET_AUTH_SELF_4)

Using Logical File Names

File names do not usually need to be validated if a program is consistent in using only [logical file names](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenlogical_filename_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") created by the system administrator in the transactions FILE or SF01. Next, the set of logical file names available to an application defines the set of possible physical file names. The associated physical file names are not processed explicitly in the program. Instead, the function module FILE\_GET\_NAME is used to create the physical file name from the logical file name directly before it is used in a [statement of the file interface](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenfile_interface_statements.htm) and used for file access.

Example

The following program works with a logical file name in field log\_name. The function module FILE\_GET\_NAME uses this file name to create a platform-specific physical file name in phys\_name (for use in the statement OPEN DATASET). As the value abap\_true is passed to parameter INCLUDING\_DIR, the physical file name is absolute; in other words, it contains an absolute path.

Using Physical File Names

If a program uses [physical file names](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenphysical_filename_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), the name almost always needs to be validated.

Self-Programmed Validation

If valid directories and file names are defined exactly (as is often the case in programs from the technical infrastructure), this type of validation can be skipped. The following can be used, for example:

-   Methods from [character string processing](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_data_string.htm),

-   Methods from class CL\_ABAP\_DYN\_PRG for checking whitelists,

-   Methods in the class CL\_FS\_PATH

However, self-programmed validations (especially when using character string processing) is suitable only for simple cases. For all other cases, validation with logical file names is usually recommended.

Validation with logical file names

In many cases, directories and file names are generic, and are predefined by the system administrator when configuring the system. They can be modified or enhanced while the system is running. In these cases, the concept of logical file names should be employed when handling physical file names explicitly.

In addition to the case above, where a program uses only logical file names, the associations between logical and physical file names can also be useful when handling physical file names for validation purposes. As long as the list of logical file names is complete, the function module FILE\_VALIDATE\_NAME can be called before a file is accessed. This module checks whether the physical file name is associated with a logical file name or whether the directory is valid. In this way, the function module checks whether the physical file exists in the set defined by the logical file names.

Hint

The function module FILE\_VALIDATE\_NAME always checks absolute file names with specified paths. If a relative file name is passed for checking, the default path is implicitly added as a prefix to DIR\_HOME in accordance with the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Example

Validation of a directory. For a directory, the logical file name contained in log\_name must have been created in the format DIR using transaction FILE. The function module FILE\_GET\_NAME provides the platform-specific path for this directory in path. For a directory, the value abap\_true must be passed to parameter INCLUDING\_DIR, otherwise the function module is terminated with an exception. The method IS\_RELATIVE of class CL\_FS\_PATH is used to check whether a file name phys\_name entered by a user is relative or contains an absolute path. An existing absolute file name is applied without being modified. Relative file names are concatenated with the path. This is done using the method APPEND\_PATH\_NAME of a path object from the class CL\_FS\_PATH created from path. This object is platform-independent and works regardless of whether path contains a closing separator like \\. Finally, phys\_name with FILE\_VALIDATE\_NAME is validated by checking the directory of log\_name. This check is also necessary when creating a chain from the path and relative file name. This is because the specified relative file name can contains parts such as \\..\\, which can point to path locations outside of the allowed directory.

[4\. ... LEGACY TEXT MODE](#!ABAP_ALTERNATIVE_4@4@)

Effect

These mandatory additions define whether the file is handled as a binary file or as a text file. By specifying LEGACY, files can be written in the format that is expected by a non- [Unicode system](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenunicode_system_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), and files that have been created by a non-Unicode-system can be read. The [byte order](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbyte_order_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or the [code page](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencodepage_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") must be specified explicitly.

Alternative 1

... BINARY MODE

Effect

The addition IN BINARY MODE opens the file as a binary file. When writing to a binary file, the binary content of a data object is passed in unchanged form to the file. When reading from a binary file, the binary content of the file is passed in unchanged form to a data object.

Example

Opens a binary file for reads and writes. The binary data is created by converting a string to [UTF-8](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenutf8_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

DATA(utf8) =
¬†¬†cl\_abap\_conv\_codepage=>create\_out( )->convert( 'Blahblahblah ...' ).
DATA(dset) = 'test.dat'.
OPEN DATASET dset FOR OUTPUT IN BINARY MODE.
TRANSFER utf8 TO dset.
CLOSE DATASET dset.
...
CLEAR utf8.
OPEN DATASET dset FOR INPUT IN BINARY MODE.
READ DATASET dset INTO utf8.
CLOSE DATASET dset.
cl\_demo\_output=>display(
¬†¬†cl\_abap\_conv\_codepage=>create\_in( )->convert( utf8 ) ).
DELETE DATASET dset.

Alternative 2

... TEXT MODE

Effect

The addition IN TEXT MODE opens the file as a text file. Only the content of character-like data objects can be passed to text files and read from text files.

The addition [encoding](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_encoding.htm) defines how the characters are represented in the text file. When writing to a text file, the content of a data object is converted to the representation entered after encoding, and passed to the file. If the data type is character-like and [flat](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenflat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), any trailing blanks are cut off. In the data type string, trailing blanks are not cut off.

The end-of-line selection of the relevant platform is applied to the passed data by default. When reading from a text file, the content of the file is read until the next end-of-line selection, converted from the format specified after ENCODING into the current character format, and passed to a data object. The end-of-line selection used is controlled using the addition [linefeed](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_linefeed.htm).

Example

Opens a text file for reads and writes. A line end marking is appended in every write in every TRANSFER statement. Any reads are performed line by line. Compare the example for the addition NO END OF LINE of the statement [TRANSFER](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abaptransfer.htm).

Alternative 3

... LEGACY BINARY MODE

Effect

Opening a [legacy file](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenlegacy_file_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The addition IN LEGACY BINARY MODE opens the file as a legacy binary file, where [endian](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_endian.htm) can be used to specify the [byte order](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbyte_order_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and [CODE PAGE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_code_page.htm) can be used to specify the [code page](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencodepage_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that handle the content of the file.

Hint

When a flat character-like field is written to the legacy binary files, the number of bytes written to the file is the same as the number of characters in the source field. The field content can be affected by this when writing texts in Eastern Asian languages. It is therefore best to only write texts opened without the addition LEGACY to text files.

Example

See the example for the addition [endian](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_endian.htm).

Alternative 4

... LEGACY TEXT MODE

Effect

Opening a [legacy file](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenlegacy_file_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The addition IN LEGACY TEXT MODE opens the file as a legacy text file, where (in legacy binary files) [endian](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_endian.htm) can be used to specify the byte order and [CODE PAGE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_code_page.htm) can be used to specify the code page that handle the content of the file. The syntax and semantics of *{*BIG*|*LITTLE*}* ENDIAN and CODE PAGE cp are the same as in legacy binary files. The syntax and meaning of [linefeed](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_linefeed.htm) are the same as for regular text files.

In contrast to legacy binary files, the trailing blanks are cut off when writing character-like [flat](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenflat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") data objects to a legacy text file. Also, as in the case of a text file, an [end-of-line selection](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_linefeed.htm) is appended to the passed data by default. Unlike the text files opened by the addition IN TEXT MODE, there is no check on whether the data objects used in writing or reading are character-like. Also, the LENGTH additions of the statements READ DATASET and TRANSFER are used for counting. In legacy text files these additions count in bytes, and an text files they count in the units of a character represented in the memory.

Hints

-   As is the case with legacy binary files, it is possible to access text files written in non-Unicode systems as legacy text files. In this case, the content is converted accordingly.

-   When writing to a flat character-like field in legacy text files, the maximum number of bytes that can be written to the file is the maximum number of characters in the source field. The field content can be affected by this when writing texts in Eastern Asian languages. It is therefore best to only write texts opened without the addition LEGACY to text files.

[3\. ... NON-UNICODE](#!ABAP_ALTERNATIVE_3@3@)

Effect

The additions after the mandatory addition ENCODING define the character representation in which the content of a text file is handled.

Programming Guideline

[Write text files in UTF-8 and with a byte order mark.](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencodepage_file_guidl.htm "Guideline")

Hint

It is best to always write files in UTF-8 (if all readers can process this format). Otherwise, the code page can depend on the [text environment](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abentext_environment_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and it is difficult to identify the code page from the file content.

Alternative 1

... DEFAULT

Effect

If specified, DEFAULT is the same as specifying UTF-8.

Alternative 2

... UTF-8 *\[*SKIPPING*|*WITH BYTE-ORDER MARK*\]*

Addition:

[... SKIPPING*|*WITH BYTE-ORDER MARK](#!ABAP_ONE_ADD@1@)

Effect

The characters in the file are handled in accordance with the Unicode character representation [UTF-8](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenutf8_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Hints

-   The class CL\_ABAP\_FILE\_UTILITIES contains the method CHECK\_UTF8 for determining whether a file is a UTF-8 file.

-   A UTF-16 file can only be opened as a binary file.
    

Example

Opens a text file as a UTF-8 file and writes a string containing German umlaut characters to the file. The file is read to a byte string and this byte string is converted from UTF-8 to a character string. This is done using an object created by the class CL\_ABAP\_CONV\_CODEPAGE and the method CONVERT of the interface IF\_ABAP\_CONV\_IN.

DATA(dset) = 'test.dat'.
OPEN DATASET dset FOR OUTPUT IN TEXT MODE ENCODING UTF-8.
TRANSFER '√Ñ√§√ñ√∂√ú√º' TO dset.
CLOSE DATASET dset.
DATA xstr TYPE xstring.
OPEN DATASET dset FOR INPUT IN BINARY MODE.
READ DATASET dset INTO xstr.
CLOSE DATASET dset.
cl\_demo\_output=>display(
¬†¬†cl\_abap\_conv\_codepage=>create\_in( )->convert( xstr ) ).
DELETE DATASET dset.

Addition

... SKIPPING*|*WITH BYTE-ORDER MARK

Effect

This addition defines how the byte order mark (BOM), with which a file encoded in the UTF-8 format can begin, is handled. The BOM is a sequence of three bytes that indicates that a file is encoded in [UTF-8](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenutf8_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

-   SKIPPING BYTE-ORDER MARK
    is only allowed if the file is opened for reads or writes using [FOR INPUT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_access.htm) or [FOR UPDATE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_access.htm). If there is a BOM at the start of the file, this is ignored and the file pointer is set after it. Without the addition, the BOM is handled as normal file content.
    

-   WITH BYTE-ORDER MARK
    is only allowed if the file is opened for writing using [FOR OUTPUT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_access.htm). When the file is opened, a BOM is inserted at the start of the file. Without the addition, no BOM is inserted.

The addition BYTE-ORDER MARK cannot be used together with the [AT POSITION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_position.htm) addition.

Hints

-   When opening UTF-8 files for reading, it is best to always enter the addition SKIPPING BYTE-ORDER MARK to prevent a BOM from being handled as file content.

-   It is recommended that a file for reading is always opened as a UTF-8 file using the addition WITH BYTE-ORDER MARK (as long as all readers can process this format).

-   The method CREATE\_UTF8\_FILE\_WITH\_BOM in the system class CL\_ABAP\_FILE\_UTILITIES can be used to create a file with BOM.
    

Example

The binary content of the text file opened using WITH BYTE-ORDER MARK is EFBBBF616263. EFBBBF is specified as a BOM at the start of the file. This is followed by the UTF-8 representation 616263 of the actual characters abc.

DATA(dset) = 'test.dat'.
OPEN DATASET dset FOR OUTPUT IN TEXT MODE
¬†¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†ENCODING UTF-8 WITH BYTE-ORDER MARK.
TRANSFER 'aaa' TO dset NO END OF LINE.
CLOSE DATASET dset.
DATA xstr TYPE xstring.
OPEN DATASET dset FOR INPUT IN BINARY MODE.
READ DATASET dset INTO xstr.
CLOSE DATASET dset.
cl\_demo\_output=>display( xstr ).
DELETE DATASET dset.

Alternative 3

... NON-UNICODE

Effect

The characters of the file are handled in accordance with the non-Unicode code page that would be assigned when reading or writing data in a non-Unicode system (as specified by the entry in the database table TCP0C in the current [text environment](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abentext_environment_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")).

Example

Writes German umlaut characters to a non-Unicode code page. This code page is then extracted from the database table TCP0C and used to open the file as a a legacy text file.

DATA(dset) = 'test.dat'.
OPEN DATASET dset FOR OUTPUT IN TEXT MODE ENCODING NON-UNICODE.

Syntax

... WITH *{* NATIVE

[3\. ... WITH UNIX LINEFEED](#!ABAP_ALTERNATIVE_3@3@)
[4\. ... WITH WINDOWS LINEFEED](#!ABAP_ALTERNATIVE_4@4@)

Effect

These additions determine which line end marker is used for [text files](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abentext_file_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or [legacy](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenlegacy_file_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") text files. If these additions are used, the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") abap/NTfmode is ignored. The two values "UNIX" or "NT" cannot both be specified in the addition [TYPE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_os_addition.htm) at the same time.

If these additions are not used, the line end marker is determined as follows, depending on the operating system of the current [AS instance](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenapplication_server_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"):

-   The line end marker for Unix is "LF". On Unix, OS/390, and IBM i5/OS (previously known as OS/400), only "LF" is used for reading and writing.
    

-   The line end marker for MS Windows is "CRLF". On MS Windows, however, the values of the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") abap/NTfmode can also be used to specify whether new files are handled according to Unix conventions or Windows conventions. If the profile parameter has the value "b", the Unix line end marker "LF" is used. If the profile parameter has the value "t" or is initial, the Windows line end marker "CRLF" is used. The setting in the profile parameter can be overridden with the addition [TYPE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_os_addition.htm) and the value "UNIX" or "NT". If an existing file is opened without the addition TYPE, this file is searched for the first line end marker ("LF" or "CRLF"), and this is used for the whole file. If no line end marker is found, the profile parameter is used. This applies particularly if an existing file is completely overwritten with [FOR OUTPUT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_access.htm).
    

If an addition WITH NATIVE*|*SMART*|*UNIX*|*WINDOWS LINEFEED is used, this setting can be changed for the open file using the statement [SET DATASET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapset_dataset.htm). If neither of the additions is used, the line end marker cannot be changed using SET DATASET either.

Hints

-   Without the use of an addition WITH LINEFEED, the line end marker is dependent on various implicit factors such as the operating system of the current AS instance [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), a profile parameter, and line end markings that are already used. For this reason, the explicit use of WITH LINEFEED is recommended, which renders the use of the addition [TYPE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_os_addition.htm) for setting the line end marker obsolete.

-   The line end marker that is currently used can be determined for every open file using [GET DATASET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapget_dataset.htm).
    

Alternative 1

... WITH NATIVE LINEFEED

Effect

This addition defines the line end marker independently of the [access type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_access.htm) in accordance with the operating system of the current AS instance [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), in other words "LF" for Unix, OS/390, and IBM i5/OS (previously known as OS/400), and "CRLF" for MS Windows.

The line end marker is interpreted in accordance with the current code page. If a code page is specified explicitly using the addition [CODE PAGE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_mode.htm), the control characters of the line end marker must be available or be written according to this code page.

Hint

The addition WITH NATIVE LINEFEED is intended for processing files on a host computer that can also be accessed by other means. The addition receives the appropriate line end marker without the program needing to know the operating system.

Example

The following example shows the UTF 8 representation of the current line end marking. Comparisons with the corresponding control characters in [string templates](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenstring_template_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") ensure that it is either "LF" or "CRLF".

DATA(dset) = 'test.dat'.
OPEN DATASET dset FOR OUTPUT IN TEXT MODE ENCODING DEFAULT
¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†WITH NATIVE LINEFEED.

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† xstr = cl\_abap\_conv\_codepage=>create\_out( )->convert( |\\r\\n| ).

Alternative 2

... WITH SMART LINEFEED

Effect

This addition depends on the [access type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_access.htm):

-   In files that are opened for reading using FOR INPUT, both "LF" and "CRLF" are interpreted as a line end marker. When opening an EBCDIC file with the addition [CODE PAGE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_mode.htm), the corresponding ASCII control characters are recognized alongside the "LF", "CRLF", and EBCDIC control characters. In addition, the EBCDIC control characters "NL" (line separator) is also interpreted as a line end marker.
    

-   In files opened for appending or changing with FOR APPENDING or FOR UPDATE, the program searches for a line end marker that is already used in the file. The end of the file is identified first. If no line end marker is found here, a number of characters at the beginning is analyzed. If a line end marker is found, this is used when writing to the file. This is also affected by the addition [CODE PAGE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_mode.htm). For example, ASCII line end markers are recognized and used in a file opened with EBCDIC, but not the other way round. If no line end marker is found or no search is possible (for example, if the file is opened with the addition [FILTER](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_os_addition.htm)), the line end marker is defined in accordance with the operating system of the current AS instance [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), as with the addition WITH NATIVE LINEFEED.
    

-   In files opened for writing using FOR OUTPUT, the line end marker is determined in accordance with the operating system the current AS instance [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), as with the addition WITH NATIVE LINEFEED.
    

Hint

The addition WITH SMART LINEFEED is intended for the generic processing of files in heterogeneous environments. The line end marker is recognized and set for different formats. Using this addition is the best solution for most application cases.

Example

Writes a text file with the line end marking "CRLF". Using the addition WITH SMART LINEFEED (open to read), this marking is also detected on platforms that expect "LF".

Effect

The line end marker is set to "LF" regardless of the [access type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_access.htm) and operating system of the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance .

The line end marker is interpreted in accordance with the current code page. If a code page is specified explicitly using the addition [CODE PAGE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_mode.htm), the control character for the line end marker must be available or be written according to this code page.

Hint

The addition WITH UNIX LINEFEED is intended for processing Unix files in which the specific line end markers are to be retained, even if the operating system of the current AS instance [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is [MS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") Windows.

Example

The following example sets the line end marking to "LF". This marking is detected after it is read to a binary file and compared with the corresponding control character in a [string template](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenstring_template_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Syntax

... *{*BIG*|*LITTLE*}* ENDIAN ...

Effect

This addition specifies that, when a [legacy file](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenlegacy_file_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is opened, numeric data objects of the type i, int8, decfloat16, decfloat34, f, or s are stored in the file in the [byte order](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbyte_order_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") Big Endian or Little Endian. When a data object of these types is written or read, a conversion between these orders and the byte order of the current platform is performed, if necessary. If the addition is not specified, the byte order of the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current [AS instance](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenapplication_server_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is used.

Hints

-   The statement [SET DATASET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapset_dataset.htm) can be used to specify a different byte order for an opened legacy file.

-   The addition *{*BIG*|*LITTLE*}* ENDIAN replaces the use of the obsolete statement [TRANSLATE NUMBER FORMAT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abaptranslate.htm) in the case of file accesses.

Example

Opens a legacy binary file with different byte orders for writing. In each case, the integer 111 is written to the file and the content is read in binary format to a byte string. The results are 0000006F and 6F000000, that is, 111 in binary format in Big Endian and Little Endian.

Syntax

...¬†¬†CODE PAGE cp ...

Effect

This addition specifies that, when a [legacy file](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenlegacy_file_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is opened, the representation of character-like data objects in the file is based on the code page specified in cp. When a character-like data object is written or read, a conversion between this code page and the current character representation is performed, if necessary. If this addition is not specified, the characters in the file are handled in accordance with the non-Unicode code page that would be assigned when reading or writing data in a non-Unicode system (as specified by the entry in the database table TCP0C in the current [text environment](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abentext_environment_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")).

If specified, the code page cp expects a character-like data object that must contain, when the statement is executed, the name of a non-Unicode page from the column CPCODEPAGE in the database table TCP00. Unicode code pages cannot be specified.

Hints

-   This addition enables the automatic conversion of file content to the current Unicode character representation [UCS-2](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenucs2_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") when reading and writing files. In this way, files saved in any non-Unicode systems can be imported.

-   The statement [SET DATASET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapset_dataset.htm) can be used to specify a different code page for an opened legacy file.

-   The addition CODE PAGE replaces the use of the obsolete statement [TRANSLATE CODE PAGE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abaptranslate.htm) in when accessing files.

Example

Opens legacy text files with the IDs 1101 for 7-Bit USA ASCII and 1102 for 7-Bit German ASCII from the table TCP00. When a German umlaut character is written to the open file with the ID 1101, an exception of the class CX\_SY\_CONVERSION\_CODEPAGE is raised. When the character is written to the open file with the ID 1102, this exception is not raised. See also the example for the addition [REPLACEMENT CHARACTER](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_error_handling.htm).

Derived Types

\* Work in progress \*

ABAP Compiler makes it possible to create derived types for type-secure parameters of a business object provider. Data types like this are known as derived types, since the compiler derives them from CDS entity types and their behavior definition implicitly.

Derived types contain at least the instance key (in accordance with the CDS definition) and possibly also the full line type, plus any other components produced by the model (for example, the parameters of an action).

When a business object provider is implemented, certain derived types can be used in method signatures in the context of the behavior implementation. This means the syntax can be used to create both local and global derived data types, which are used to declare input parameters or output parameters.

Input Parameter Type

\* Work in progress \*

Syntax

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†CREATE*|*UPDATE*|*DELETE*|*LOCK*|*READ IMPORT
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†CDS\_entity\_name.
TYPES type\_for\_action\_import\_parameter TYPE TABLE FOR
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†ACTION IMPORT entity\_name~action\_name.

Effect

Each individual type declaration for input parameters consists of a combination of an operation (CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE, LOCK or READ IMPORT) and an entity or an entity part (for actions).

IMPORT, RESULT, or LINK entity-association is expected after READ.

The type name of the input parameter type\_for\_import\_parameter can be specified freely.

If available, the [alias](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbdl_alias.htm) specified in the [behavior definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencds_behavior_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") should be used to reference a CDS entity. Therefore, CDS\_entity\_name refers to the name of the CDS entity or the alias as defined in the behavior definition.

Example

In the following example, the data from the ABAP flight data reference scenario (short flight data scenario) is used. It represents a legacy business logic that can be used to create and update flight bookings. The root entity Travel represents the business object for managing flight trips. The underlying data model and the behavior of the root entity Travel are described in the CDS BDL - Example.

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†behavior\_definition\_name.

Effect

The output parameters FAILED, MAPPED, and REPORTED are structure types that contain one component for each entity of the business object:

-   MAPPED *\[*LATE*\]*
    Provides the consumer with ID mapping information.
    The mapping information is available in the interaction phase by default. The [%CID](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencomponents_derived_types.htm) is then mapped to the real key or to the [%PID](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencomponents_derived_types.htm). The addition LATE specifies that the mapping information is available only when saving. This is important when [late numbering](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenlate_numbering_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is used (the method [adjust\_numbers](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abensaver_adjust_numbers.htm)), during which the %PID is mapped to the real key.

-   FAILED *\[*LATE*\]*
    Contains information that identifies the data record when an error occurs.
    FAILED is provided during the [interaction phase](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_behavior_pools.htm) and contains the %CID or the [%KEY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencomponents_derived_types.htm) to specify instances for which an operation (CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE, LOCK, or READ IMPORT) has failed. FAILED with the addition LATE is provided during the [save phase](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_behavior_pools.htm) only and contains the %PID or the %KEY, but not the %CID.

-   REPORTED *\[*LATE*\]*
    This parameter is used to send error messages.
    REPORTED is provided during the interaction phase and contains the %CID or the %KEY to specify instances for which an operation has failed. REPORTED LATE is provided when saving only and contains the %PID or the %KEY, but not the %CID.

-   READ RESULT
    This parameter is used to return the result of the operation READ.

The type name of the output parameter (type\_for\_export\_parameter, type\_for\_action\_export\_parameter, and ts\_reported) can be specified freely.

CDS\_entity\_name refers to the name of the CDS entity or the [alias](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbdl_alias.htm) as defined in the [behavior definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencds_behavior_definitions.htm) for the CDS entity.

...TYPE RESPONSE FOR... are structures that contain one component for each entity of the business object.

Example

In the following example, the data from a is used. It represents a legacy business logic that can be used to create and update flight bookings. The root entity Travel represents the business object for managing flight trips. The underlying data model and the behavior of the root entity Travel are described in CDS BDL - Example.

Specific Derived Types

\* Work in progress \*

Syntax

TYPES type\_for\_update TYPE TABLE FOR UPDATE CDS\_entity\_name.

Effect

Alongside derived parameter types (the types of the [input parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrpm_input_parameters.htm) and [output parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrpm_export_parameters.htm)), certain derived data types can also be defined for the ID fields and data fields.

Using TYPE STRUCTURE FOR it is possible to directly get the row type of a derived table type. This way, the two-stage solution using LINE OF can be avoided.

Example

In the following example, the data from a function module is used. It represents a legacy business logic that can be used to create and update flight bookings. The root entity Travel represents the business object for managing flight trips. The underlying data model and the behavior of the root entity Travel are described in CDS BDL - Example.

Effect

In the case of modularization, it may be necessary to declare variables with derived types outside the reserved handler methods too. For this purpose, a special syntax in the form TYPE TABLE FOR is provided, which is supported in the statements TYPES, DATA and CREATE DATA.

It is not possible to use an alias to reference the entity here, only the entity\_name. This is because, unlike in handler methods, no reference to a specific behavior definition is given.

Data objects with derived type can also be created dynamically, preferably using the method CL\_ABAP\_BEHVDESCR=>CREATE\_DATA( ). The way the objects are created is based on absolute types. If preferred, these types can be constructed manually and instantiated using CREATE DATA dref TYPE (name).

The absolute name starts with \\BDEF=, followed by bdef\_name (the name of the behavior definition). This is usually followed by \\ENTITY=entity\_name and a specified operation. The schema for all derived types is as follows:

\\BDEF=bdef\_name\\ENTITY=entity\_name\\TYPE=CREATE
\\BDEF=bdef\_name\\ENTITY=entity\_name\\TYPE=UPDATE
\\BDEF=bdef\_name\\ENTITY=entity\_name\\TYPE=DELETE
\\BDEF=bdef\_name\\ENTITY=entity\_name\\TYPE=LOCK

\\BDEF=bdef\_name\\ENTITY=entity\_name\\TYPE=MAPPED

\\BDEF=bdef\_name\\ENTITY=entity\_name\\TYPE=MAPPED\_LATE
\\BDEF=bdef\_name\\ENTITY=entity\_name\\TYPE=REPORTED\_LATE

For the operation READ IMPORT:
\\BDEF=bdef\_name\\ENTITY=entity\_name\\TYPE=READ\_I

For the operation READ RESULT:
\\BDEF=bdef\_name\\ENTITY=entity\_name\\TYPE=READ\_R

For the operation ACTION IMPORT:
\\BDEF=bdef\_name\\ENTITY=entity\_name\\ACTION=action\_name\\TYPE=IMPORTING

For the operation ACTION RESULT:
\\BDEF=bdef\_name\\ENTITY=entity\_name\\ACTION=action\_name\\TYPE=RETURNING

For the operation read-by-association IMPORT:
\\BDEF=bdef\_name\\ENTITY=entity\_name\\ASSOC=assoc\_name\\TYPE=READ\_I

For the operation read-by-association RESULT:
\\BDEF=bdef\_name\\ENTITY=entity\_name\\ASSOC=assoc\_name\\TYPE=READ\_R

For the operation read-by-association LINK:
\\BDEF=bdef\_name\\ENTITY=entity\_name\\ASSOC=assoc\_name\\TYPE=LINK

For the operation create-by-association:
\\BDEF=bdef\_name\\ENTITY=entity\_name\\ASSOC=assoc\_name\\TYPE=CREATE

For response structures:

Component of the Derived Types

\* Work in progress \*

[Derived data types](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrpm_derived_types.htm) in the context of [ABAP RAP](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_rap_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") also contain components that are not based on the line type of the entity and that start with the character % to avoid naming conflicts with original components. For example, the line type of the failed table failed contains a component %FAIL used to save the symptom of a failed instance, plus an include structure %KEY that contains all primary key fields of the entity.

The following list contains the most frequent components of the derived types:

-   Content ID %CID
    A temporary primary key for an instance (if the business object runtime did not create a primary key).
    The content ID is granted to bind the result of an operation to a name and address it again in a later operation. More specifically this applies to the operation CREATE, where the input does not contain the granted instance key (except where keys are granted externally). The component %CID is generated in the operations CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE, create-by-association, and ACTION and applied to the parameters failed, mapped, and reported.

-   %CID\_REF
    A reference to the content ID %CID.

-   %KEY
    Contains all key elements of an entity.
    The component %KEY is generated in the operations CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE, create-by-association, ACTION, READ, and read-by-association and applied to the parameters LINK, failed, mapped and reported.

-   %PID
    The temporary ID component of type ABP\_BEHV\_PID.
    %PID is available only if [late numbering](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbdl_late_numbering.htm) is defined in the [behavior definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencds_behavior_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") without the addition in place. %PID is used only if the application does not provide a temporary primary key %TMP. In the operation CREATE, %PID must be entered in the mapped table and hence set with respect to %CID.
    The component %PID is generated in the operations UPDATE, DELETE create-by-association, ACTION, READ, and read-by-association and applied to the parameters failed, mapped, and reported.

-   %PIDPARENT and %PID\_Assoc
    In the period before the final keys are granted, the %PID fields must represent the instance hierarchy and their associations using non-composition associations. The instance hierarchy is represented using the field %PIDPARENT, which (generically) applies the function of the superordinate foreign key. The associations are provided using %PID\_Assoc fields, which are inserted in a target entity with late numbering and to-one [cardinality](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencardinality_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") for each association with the name (or alias Assoc) released in a transactional way. Cardinality 0..1 or 1 matches a foreign key in the source entity. %PID\_Assoc applies this function if it is not filled.

-   %CONTROL
    Specifies which elements of an entity are requested by the consumer.
    For each entity element, the control structure %CONTROL contains a flag specifying whether the field in question is provided or requested by the consumer. The fields of the entity have the uniform type ABP\_BEHV\_FLAG.
    The component %CONTROL is generated in CREATE, UPDATE, create-by-association (in %TARGET), and READ IMPORT.

-   %DATA
    Contains all data elements of an entity.
    The component %DATA is generated in CREATE, UPDATE, create-by-association (in %TARGET), and READ RESULT.

-   %FAIL
    Saves the symptom of a failed data record of a business object instance. The possible values of the component %FAIL are defined by the ENUM type IF\_ABAP\_BEHV=>T\_FAIL\_CAUSE.

-   %MSG
    Provides an instance of IF\_ABAP\_BEHV\_MESSAGE. The default methods for the messages new\_message( ) and new\_message\_with\_text( ) can be used.

-   %ELEMENT
    References all elements of an entity

-   %PARAM
    Contains the input type and output type of an action.

Example

Uses components of the derived types in a parameter with errors:

APPEND #VALUE( %KEY = item-%KEY %FAIL = ... ) TO failed-Item.

item points to a line of the input parameters, for example update\_import\_parameter.

ABAP Entity Manipulation Language

\* Work in progress \*

Entity Manipulation Language (or EML for short) is a set of ABAP statements for manipulating the [CDS entities](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencds_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that are granted a behavior by the [behavior definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencds_behavior_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). EML statements allow:

-   Modifying operations on CDS entities.
    For this purpose, the statement MODIFY ENTITIES is available in different variants, which reference one or more entities of a [RAP business object](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrap_bo_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), statically or dynamically: [MODIFY ENTITIES](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeneml_modify_entities.htm), [MODIFY ENTITY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeneml_modify_entity.htm) and [MODIFY ENTITIES OPERATIONS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeneml_modify_entities_op.htm).

-   Read operations on CDS entities.
    For this purpose, the statement READ ENTITIES is available in different variants, which reference one or more entities of a business object, statically or dynamically: [READ ENTITIES](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenread_behavior.htm), [READ ENTITY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeneml_read_entity.htm) and [READ ENTITIES OPERATIONS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeneml_read_entities_op.htm).

-   Triggering the saver sequence.
    For this purpose the statement [COMMIT ENTITIES](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeneml_commit_entities.htm) is available in different variants: COMMIT ENTITIES and COMMIT ENTITIES RESPONSES.

-   Handling the result of the [adjust\_numbers](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abensaver_adjust_numbers.htm) method.
    For this purpose there is the block-constructing variant of COMMIT ENTITIES and the [CONVERT KEY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconvert_key.htm) statement.

-   Rolling back all changes since the last COMMIT.
    For this purpose there is the [ROLLBACK ENTITIES](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeneml_rollback_entities.htm) statement.

-   Explicit locking of instances for a following modification.
    For this purpose the statement [SET LOCKS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeneml_set_locks.htm) is available in different variants: SET LOCKS OF and SET LOCKS ENTITY.

If the IMPORT table is empty, the method is not called.

Effect

EML is ABAP.

The [EML](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeneml.htm) statement MODIFY ENTITIES enables change operations to be made to the [CDS entities](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencds_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). It can have a long, short, or dynamic form.

-   The long form, MODIFY ENTITIES, makes it possible to group multiple operations in multiple entities of a business object.

-   The short form [MODIFY ENTITY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeneml_modify_entity.htm) is intended for the special case where only a single entity is operated on.

-   The dynamic form [MODIFY ENTITIES OPERATIONS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeneml_modify_entities_op.htm) makes it possible to merge operations in multiple business objects in one MODIFY statement. There is no dynamic short form.

The following points apply for the syntax of the statement MODIFY ENTITIES:

-   The name of the business object (the same as the name of the [root entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenroot_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")) root\_name is specified after OF. This is followed by a list of the operations, grouped by the entity (the schema):
    ENTITY entity\_name operation *\[*operation ...*\]*

-   Grouping operations by entity is not mandatory, since ENTITY entity\_name can be repeated. The same combination of entity\_name and operation, however, cannot occur more than once.

-   The [alias](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbdl_alias.htm) of the entity should be used as entity\_name, if one is defined in the behavior definition . The original name of the entity can also be used instead of the alias, but this produces a warning.

-   The input of each operation is a table of instances (or a table from [%CID](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencomponents_derived_types.htm) in the case of static actions) specified after FROM.

-   For [actions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbdl_action.htm) that produce a result (in accordance with the [behavior definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencds_behavior_definitions.htm)), RESULT ... can be used to specify a target variable it\_result\_a or declare it inline (for example, RESULT DATA(it\_result\_a)).

The following applies to the response variables:

-   The response variables are structures with n components (one component per entity in the business object) that are specified for the derived type of the [output parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrpm_export_parameters.htm).

-   They must either have the matching type (for example, FAILED it\_failed) or be declared inline (for example, FAILED DATA(it\_failed)).

-   Up to three response variables can be specified to hold response information: FAILED, MAPPED, and REPORTED.

-   These are the early response types (without the addition [LATE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbdl_late_numbering.htm)). The instances are identified using the keys valid in the modifying phase.

Syntax

MODIFY
¬†¬†ENTITY entity\_name
¬†¬†¬†¬†CREATE FROM instance\_create
¬†¬†¬†¬†CREATE BY \\assoc\_name FROM it\_instance\_cba

¬†¬†*\[*MAPPED¬†¬† it\_mapped *|* DATA(it\_mapped)*\]*
¬†¬†*\[*REPORTED it\_reported *|* DATA(it\_reported)*\]*.

Effect

The short form MODIFY ENTITY is intended for the special case where only a single entity is operated on. In this case, access via the [RAP business object](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrap_bo_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") (the [root entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenroot_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") root\_name) is not necessary.

The following points apply for the syntax of the statement MODIFY ENTITY:

-   The ENTITY entity\_name is specified once.

-   An alias of the entity cannot be used since no context of the business object is known.

-   This is followed by a list of the change operations, grouped by entity (schema):
    ¬†¬†¬†¬†MODIFY ENTITY entity\_name
    ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† operation
    ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†*\[*operation ...*\]*

¬†¬† *\[*MAPPED ¬† it\_mapped¬†¬† *|* DATA(it\_mapped)*\]*
¬†¬† *\[*REPORTED it\_reported *|* DATA(it\_reported)*\]*.

Effect

The dynamic form MODIFY ENTITIES OPERATIONS does not specify an introductory name of the [RAP business object](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrap_bo_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") (OF root\_name). It allows to merge operations on multiple business objects in a statement.

The line type of an operation operation has the type ABP\_BEHV\_CHANGES\_TAB and consists of following fields:

-   OP¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Type¬†¬†ABP\_BEHV\_OP\_MODIFY
    Operation: IF\_ABAP\_BEHV=>OP-M-CREATE*|*UPDATE*|*DELETE*|*EXECUTE

-   SUB\_NAME¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Type¬†¬†C¬†¬†Length¬†¬†30
    Contains the function or association name (for create-by-association); is empty otherwise.

-   INSTANCES¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Type¬†¬†REF¬†¬†TO¬†¬†DATA
    Contains the derived table type for the operation.

-   RESULTS¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Type¬†¬†REF¬†¬†TO¬†¬†DATA
    Contains the derived type for the results of an action; is empty otherwise.

The response structures FAILED, MAPPED and REPORTED must either have the matching type or be declared inline (for example REPORTED DATA(ls\_repd)). The line type of the response structures has the type ABP\_BEHV\_RESPONSE\_TAB and consists of the following fields:

-   ROOT\_NAME¬†¬†¬†¬†Type¬†¬†ABP\_ROOT\_ENTITY\_NAME

-   ENTITY\_NAME¬†¬†Type¬†¬†ABP\_ENTITY\_NAME

-   ENTRIES¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Type¬†¬†REF TO DATA

Effect

The [EML](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeneml.htm) statement READ ENTITIES enables read operations to be made to the [CDS entities](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencds_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). It can have a long, short, or dynamic form.

-   The long form, READ ENTITIES, makes it possible to group multiple operations in multiple entities of a business object.

-   The short form [READ ENTITY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeneml_read_entity.htm) is intended for the special case where only a single entity is operated on.

-   The dynamic form [READ ENTITIES OPERATIONS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeneml_read_entities_op.htm) makes it possible to merge operations in multiple [RAP business objects](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrap_bo_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in one statement. There is no dynamic short form.

The following points apply for the syntax of the statement READ ENTITIES:

-   The name of the business object (the same as the name of the [root entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenroot_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")) root\_name is specified after OF.

-   This is followed by the list of the operations, grouped by entity (schema):
    ¬†¬†¬†¬†ENTITY entity\_name
    ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† operation
    ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†*\[*operation ...*\]*
    Grouping operations by entity is not mandatory, since ENTITY entity\_name can be repeated. The same combination of entity\_name and operation, however, cannot occur more than once.

-   The [alias](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbdl_alias.htm) of the entity should be used as entity\_name, if one is defined in the [behavior definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencds_behavior_definitions.htm). The original name of the entity can also be used instead of the alias, but this produces a warning.

-   The simple READ ENTITIES statement does not have its own keyword (such as CREATE in [MODIFY ENTITIES](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeneml_modify_entities.htm)), rather it starts directly with FROM it\_instance.

-   READ ENTITIES statements always have the addition RESULT, since the result of the read must be specified.

-   Two parameters are bound for each operation (source and target variable); in read-by-association, on the other hand, up to three variables (source and target variable and link) can be bound.

-   Read-by-Association has the following form:
    ¬†¬†¬†¬†READ BY \\association\_name FROM instances
    ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† RESULT results
    ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† LINK¬†¬† links
    Here, at least one of the target variables (results or links) must be specified. The variable results contains the target instances with all fields, whereas the variable links contains only a list of key pairs: Source key, target key. Target variables must have the appropriate type (for example, RESULT it\_result\_a) or can be declared inline (for example, RESULT DATA(it\_result\_a)).

The following applies for the response variables:

-   The response variables are structures with n component (one component for each entity of the business object).

-   Up to two variables can be specified to hold response information: FAILED and REPORTED. There are no key assignments in the statement READ ENTITIES, which is why the response structure MAPPED is not used.

-   The response variables must either have the matching type or be declared inline (for example, FAILED DATA(it\_failed)). These are the early response types (without the addition LATE). The instances are identified using the keys valid in the interaction phase.

¬†¬†¬†¬†*\[*FAILED¬†¬† it\_failed *|* DATA(it\_failed)*\]*
¬†¬†¬†¬†*\[*REPORTED it\_reported *|* DATA(it\_reported)*\]*.

Effect

The short form READ ENTITY is intended for the special case where only a single entity is operated on. In this case, access using the [RAP business object](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrap_bo_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") (the [root entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenroot_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") root\_name) would not be necessary.

The following points apply for the syntax of the statement READ ENTITY:

-   The ENTITY entity\_name is specified once.

-   An [alias](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbdl_alias.htm) of the entity cannot be used since no context of the business object is known.

-   This is followed by a list of operations on the entity according to the schema:
    ¬†¬†¬†¬†ENTITY entity\_name
    ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†operation
    ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† *\[*operation ...*\]*

ABAP EML - READ ENTITIES OPERATIONS

\* Work in progress \*

Syntax

READ ENTITIES
¬†¬†¬†¬†OPERATIONS operations
¬†¬† *\[*FAILED ¬† it\_failed *|* DATA(it\_failed)*\]*
¬†¬† *\[*REPORTED it\_reported *|* DATA(it\_reported)*\]*.

Effect

The dynamic form READ ENTITIES OPERATIONS does not specify an introductory name of the [RAP business object](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrap_bo_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") (OF root\_name). It allows to merge operations on multiple business objects in a statement.

The table type of an operation operation has the type ABP\_BEHV\_RETRIEVALS\_TAB and consists of following fields:

-   OP¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Type¬†¬†ABP\_BEHV\_OP\_MODIFY
    Operation: IF\_ABAP\_BEHV=>R\_OP-READ|READ\_BA

-   ENTITY\_NAME¬†¬† Type¬†¬†ABP\_ENTITY\_NAME

-   SUB\_NAME¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Type¬†¬†C¬†¬†Length¬†¬†30
    Contains the function or association name (for read-by-association), is empty otherwise.

-   INSTANCES¬†¬†¬†¬† Type¬†¬†REF¬†¬†TO¬†¬†DATA
    Contains the derived table type for the operation.

-   FULL¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Type¬†¬†C¬†¬†Length 1
    Flag: Retrieve target instances (not just links)

-   RESULTS¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Type¬†¬†REF¬†¬†TO¬†¬†DATA
    Contains the derived table type for the target entity.

-   LINKS¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Type¬†¬†REF¬†¬†TO¬†¬†DATA
    Contains the derived table type for the relationships between source-and target key.

The line type of the response structures FAILED and REPORTED has the type ABP\_BEHV\_RESPONSE\_TAB and consists of the following fields:

-   ROOT\_NAME¬†¬†¬†¬† Type¬†¬†ABP\_ROOT\_ENTITY\_NAME

-   ENTITY\_NAME¬†¬† Type¬†¬†ABP\_ENTITY\_NAME

-   ENTRIES¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Type¬†¬†REF TO DATA
    Contains the derived table type for FAILED*|*REPORTED

During runtime, REF TO DATA contain the same derived types as in static cases.

ABAP EML - READ ENTITIES

\* Work in progress \*

Syntax

READ ENTITIES OF root\_name
¬†¬† ENTITY entity\_1\_name
¬†¬†¬†¬† FROM it\_instance
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† RESULT it\_result *|* DATA(it\_result)
¬†¬†¬†¬† BY \\assoc\_name FROM it\_instance\_rba
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† RESULT it\_result\_rba *|* DATA(it\_result\_rba)
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† LINK¬†¬† it\_link\_rba *|* DATA(it\_link\_rba)

¬†¬† ...
¬†¬†*\[*FAILED¬†¬† it\_failed *|* DATA(it\_failed)*\]*
¬†¬†*\[*REPORTED it\_reported *|* DATA(it\_reported)*\]*.

Effect

The [EML](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeneml.htm) statement READ ENTITIES enables read operations to be made to the [CDS entities](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencds_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). It can have a long, short, or dynamic form.

-   The long form, READ ENTITIES, makes it possible to group multiple operations in multiple entities of a business object.

-   The short form [READ ENTITY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeneml_read_entity.htm) is intended for the special case where only a single entity is operated on.

-   The dynamic form [READ ENTITIES OPERATIONS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeneml_read_entities_op.htm) makes it possible to merge operations in multiple [RAP business objects](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrap_bo_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in one statement. There is no dynamic short form.

The following points apply for the syntax of the statement READ ENTITIES:

-   The name of the business object (the same as the name of the [root entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenroot_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")) root\_name is specified after OF.

-   This is followed by the list of the operations, grouped by entity (schema):
    ¬†¬†¬†¬†ENTITY entity\_name
    ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† operation
    ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†*\[*operation ...*\]*
    Grouping operations by entity is not mandatory, since ENTITY entity\_name can be repeated. The same combination of entity\_name and operation, however, cannot occur more than once.

-   The [alias](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbdl_alias.htm) of the entity should be used as entity\_name, if one is defined in the [behavior definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencds_behavior_definitions.htm). The original name of the entity can also be used instead of the alias, but this produces a warning.

-   The simple READ ENTITIES statement does not have its own keyword (such as CREATE in [MODIFY ENTITIES](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeneml_modify_entities.htm)), rather it starts directly with FROM it\_instance.

-   READ ENTITIES statements always have the addition RESULT, since the result of the read must be specified.

-   Two parameters are bound for each operation (source and target variable); in read-by-association, on the other hand, up to three variables (source and target variable and link) can be bound.

-   Read-by-Association has the following form:
    ¬†¬†¬†¬†READ BY \\association\_name FROM instances
    ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† RESULT results
    ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† LINK¬†¬† links
    Here, at least one of the target variables (results or links) must be specified. The variable results contains the target instances with all fields, whereas the variable links contains only a list of key pairs: Source key, target key. Target variables must have the appropriate type (for example, RESULT it\_result\_a) or can be declared inline (for example, RESULT DATA(it\_result\_a)).

The following applies for the response variables:

-   The response variables are structures with n component (one component for each entity of the business object).

-   Up to two variables can be specified to hold response information: FAILED and REPORTED. There are no key assignments in the statement READ ENTITIES, which is why the response structure MAPPED is not used.

-   The response variables must either have the matching type or be declared inline (for example, FAILED DATA(it\_failed)). These are the early response types (without the addition LATE). The instances are identified using the keys valid in the interaction phase.

ABAP EML - COMMIT ENTITIES

\* Work in progress \*

Syntax

COMMIT ENTITIES
¬†¬†*\[*RESPONSE OF root\_name\_1
¬†¬†¬†¬†*\[*FAILED¬†¬†¬†¬†it\_failed¬†¬† *|* DATA(it\_failed)*\]*
¬†¬†¬†¬†*\[*REPORTED¬†¬†it\_reported *|* DATA(it\_reported)*\]**\]*

¬† ¬†¬†*\[*REPORTED¬†¬†it\_reported *|* DATA(it\_reported)*\]**\]*.

Effect

If MODIFY statements are not executed within a [behavior pool](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbehavior_pool_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and are executed by an ABAP report instead, they would be ignored by the database at first. This is because they are applied only to the transactional buffer (by definition) and the buffer content disappears at the end of the ABAP session. This means the save sequence must be triggered in this scenario. The statement COMMIT ENTITIES is used to do this.

The statement COMMIT ENTITIES saves all [RAP business objects](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrap_bo_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that are changed within the [LUW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenluw_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

In its simplest form, the statement COMMIT ENTITIES does not have any parameters.

RESPONSE can be used to obtain the response information of one or more business objects manipulated previously using [MODIFY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeneml_modify_entities.htm). A RESPONSE clause is then created for each root entity involved (root\_name\_1, root\_name\_2, ...):

The response variables are structures with n component (one component for each entity in the business object). Up to two variables can be specified for holding the response information for each [root entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenroot_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in question. FAILED and REPORTED. There are no key assignments in the statement COMMIT, which is why the response structure MAPPED is not used. The response variables must either have the matching type (for example, FAILED it\_failed) or be declared inline (for example, FAILED DATA(it\_failed)). These are the late response types: Instances are identified using the keys valid in the save phase.

The line type of the response structures FAILED and REPORTED has the type ABP\_BEHV\_RESPONSE\_TAB and consists of the following fields:

-   ROOT\_NAME¬†¬†¬†¬† Type¬†¬†ABP\_ROOT\_ENTITY\_NAME

-   ENTITY\_NAME¬†¬† Type¬†¬†ABP\_ENTITY\_NAME

-   ENTRIES¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Type¬†¬†REF TO DATA
    Contains the derived table type for FAILED*|*REPORTED

Statement successful if sy-subrc is 0. It is not enough to evaluate the result of FAILED.

Note

Within a [behavior implementation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_behavior_pools.htm), COMMIT ENTITIES is one of the forbidden statements. This restriction is also checked dynamically. If violated, the runtime error BEHAVIOR\_ILLEGAL\_STATEMENT occurs.

In its simplest form, the statement COMMIT ENTITIES does not have any parameters.

RESPONSE can be used to obtain the response information of one or more business objects manipulated previously using [MODIFY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeneml_modify_entities.htm). A RESPONSE clause is then created for each root entity involved (root\_name\_1, root\_name\_2, ...):

The response variables are structures with n component (one component for each entity in the business object). Up to two variables can be specified for holding the response information for each [root entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenroot_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in question. FAILED and REPORTED. There are no key assignments in the statement COMMIT, which is why the response structure MAPPED is not used. The response variables must either have the matching type (for example, FAILED it\_failed) or be declared inline (for example, FAILED DATA(it\_failed)). These are the late response types: Instances are identified using the keys valid in the save phase.

The line type of the response structures FAILED and REPORTED has the type ABP\_BEHV\_RESPONSE\_TAB and consists of the following fields:

-   ROOT\_NAME¬†¬†¬†¬† Type¬†¬†ABP\_ROOT\_ENTITY\_NAME

-   ENTITY\_NAME¬†¬† Type¬†¬†ABP\_ENTITY\_NAME

-   ENTRIES¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Type¬†¬†REF TO DATA
    Contains the derived table type for FAILED*|*REPORTED

Statement successful if sy-subrc is 0. It is not enough to evaluate the result of FAILED.

Note

Within a [behavior implementation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_behavior_pools.htm), COMMIT ENTITIES is one of the forbidden statements. This restriction is also checked dynamically. If violated, the runtime error BEHAVIOR\_ILLEGAL\_STATEMENT occurs.

ABAP EML - CONVERT KEY

\* Work in progress \*

Syntax

COMMIT ENTITIES BEGIN
¬†¬†...
¬†¬†CONVERT KEY OF entity\_name
¬†¬†FROM pre\_key
¬†¬†TO¬†¬† key.
COMMIT ENTITIES END.

Effect

For entities with [late numbering](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbdl_late_numbering.htm), the statement [MODIFY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhandler_method_modify.htm) provides only temporary keys. For these temporary keys, a successful save method draws finalized keys. If, for example, the keys of new instances are passed to a HTTP response, they must be the finalized values and not the temporary values from the MODIFY phase. The statement CONVERT KEY is used for this.

The statement CONVERT KEY may only be used in the context of a block-constructing variant of the statement [COMMIT ENTITIES](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeneml_commit_block.htm) to determine the finalized value of a temporary key. In the context of the statement COMMIT ENTITIES, the runtime of [ABAP RAP](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_rap_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") holds its key registry to respond to queries from the statement CONVERT KEY. In the statement COMMIT ENTITIES END, this information is then deleted.

In its dynamic form, the statement CONVERT KEY is passed the name of the entity and does not perform a static type check.

Remarks

-   Unlike the other [EML](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeneml.htm) statements, CONVERT KEY does not operate on tables. This is because the consumer typically iterates across the consumer's own data and needs to fill specific columns. The preceding extraction of all pre\_key, following by a mass conversion and insertion of keys in the target table would be more time-consuming and use more resources than repeating the direct individual operation.

-   Within a [behavior implementation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_behavior_pools.htm), the statement CONVERT KEY is allowed only in the [SAVE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abensaver_method_save.htm) method. If this rule is violated, the runtime error BEHAVIOR\_ILLEGAL\_STATEMENT occurs.

ROLLBACK ENTITIES.

Effect

The statement ROLLBACK ENTITIES rolls back all changes since the last COMMIT and resets the transactional buffer..

Using the statement ROLLBACK ENTITIES is prohibited in the [behavior implementation methods](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_behavior_pools.htm). If violated, a runtime error occurs.

¬†¬†*\[*FAILED¬†¬† it\_failed*\]*

SET LOCKS
¬†¬† ENTITY entity\_name FROM lt
¬†¬†*\[*FAILED it\_failed*\]*
¬†¬†*\[*REPORTED it\_reported*\]*.

Effect

The explicit locking of instances for a following modification is not necessary since the framework automatically locks instances contained in the method [MODIFY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhandler_method_modify.htm). However, if the application knows that instances will be needed (that need to be protected so that users cannot change the same data simultaneously), the SET LOCKS statement can be used.

Two types of the statement SET LOCKS are available:

-   a long form SET LOCKS OF root\_name

-   a short form SET LOCKS.

The table types required here can be declared statically using the syntax TYPE ... TABLE FOR LOCK OF (see [Derived Types](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrpm_derived_types.htm)).

ABAP Entity Manipulation Language

\* Work in progress \*

Entity Manipulation Language (or EML for short) is a set of ABAP statements for manipulating the [CDS entities](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencds_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that are granted a behavior by the [behavior definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencds_behavior_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). EML statements allow:

-   Modifying operations on CDS entities.
    For this purpose, the statement MODIFY ENTITIES is available in different variants, which reference one or more entities of a [RAP business object](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrap_bo_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), statically or dynamically: [MODIFY ENTITIES](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeneml_modify_entities.htm), [MODIFY ENTITY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeneml_modify_entity.htm) and [MODIFY ENTITIES OPERATIONS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeneml_modify_entities_op.htm).

-   Read operations on CDS entities.
    For this purpose, the statement READ ENTITIES is available in different variants, which reference one or more entities of a business object, statically or dynamically: [READ ENTITIES](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenread_behavior.htm), [READ ENTITY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeneml_read_entity.htm) and [READ ENTITIES OPERATIONS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeneml_read_entities_op.htm).

-   Triggering the saver sequence.
    For this purpose the statement [COMMIT ENTITIES](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeneml_commit_entities.htm) is available in different variants: COMMIT ENTITIES and COMMIT ENTITIES RESPONSES.

-   Handling the result of the [adjust\_numbers](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abensaver_adjust_numbers.htm) method.
    For this purpose there is the block-constructing variant of COMMIT ENTITIES and the [CONVERT KEY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconvert_key.htm) statement.

-   Rolling back all changes since the last COMMIT.
    For this purpose there is the [ROLLBACK ENTITIES](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeneml_rollback_entities.htm) statement.

-   Explicit locking of instances for a following modification.
    For this purpose the statement [SET LOCKS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeneml_set_locks.htm) is available in different variants: SET LOCKS OF and SET LOCKS ENTITY.

If the IMPORT table is empty, the method is not called.

¬†¬†*\[*MAPPED¬†¬† it\_mapped *|* DATA(it\_mapped)*\]*
¬†¬†*\[*REPORTED it\_reported *|* DATA(it\_reported)*\]*.

Effect

EML is ABAP.

The [EML](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeneml.htm) statement MODIFY ENTITIES enables change operations to be made to the [CDS entities](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencds_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). It can have a long, short, or dynamic form.

-   The long form, MODIFY ENTITIES, makes it possible to group multiple operations in multiple entities of a business object.

-   The short form [MODIFY ENTITY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeneml_modify_entity.htm) is intended for the special case where only a single entity is operated on.

-   The dynamic form [MODIFY ENTITIES OPERATIONS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeneml_modify_entities_op.htm) makes it possible to merge operations in multiple business objects in one MODIFY statement. There is no dynamic short form.

The following points apply for the syntax of the statement MODIFY ENTITIES:

-   The name of the business object (the same as the name of the [root entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenroot_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")) root\_name is specified after OF. This is followed by a list of the operations, grouped by the entity (the schema):
    ENTITY entity\_name operation *\[*operation ...*\]*

-   Grouping operations by entity is not mandatory, since ENTITY entity\_name can be repeated. The same combination of entity\_name and operation, however, cannot occur more than once.

-   The [alias](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbdl_alias.htm) of the entity should be used as entity\_name, if one is defined in the behavior definition . The original name of the entity can also be used instead of the alias, but this produces a warning.

-   The input of each operation is a table of instances (or a table from [%CID](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencomponents_derived_types.htm) in the case of static actions) specified after FROM.

-   For [actions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbdl_action.htm) that produce a result (in accordance with the [behavior definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencds_behavior_definitions.htm)), RESULT ... can be used to specify a target variable it\_result\_a or declare it inline (for example, RESULT DATA(it\_result\_a)).

The following applies to the response variables:

-   The response variables are structures with n components (one component per entity in the business object) that are specified for the derived type of the [output parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrpm_export_parameters.htm).

-   They must either have the matching type (for example, FAILED it\_failed) or be declared inline (for example, FAILED DATA(it\_failed)).

-   Up to three response variables can be specified to hold response information: FAILED, MAPPED, and REPORTED.

-   These are the early response types (without the addition [LATE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbdl_late_numbering.htm)). The instances are identified using the keys valid in the modifying phase.

Syntax

MODIFY
¬†¬†ENTITY entity\_name
¬†¬†¬†¬†CREATE FROM instance\_create
¬†¬†¬†¬†CREATE BY \\assoc\_name FROM it\_instance\_cba
¬†¬†¬†¬†UPDATE FROM it\_instance\_u

¬†¬†*\[*MAPPED¬†¬† it\_mapped *|* DATA(it\_mapped)*\]*
¬†¬†*\[*REPORTED it\_reported *|* DATA(it\_reported)*\]*.

Effect

The short form MODIFY ENTITY is intended for the special case where only a single entity is operated on. In this case, access via the [RAP business object](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrap_bo_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") (the [root entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenroot_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") root\_name) is not necessary.

The following points apply for the syntax of the statement MODIFY ENTITY:

-   The ENTITY entity\_name is specified once.

-   An alias of the entity cannot be used since no context of the business object is known.

-   This is followed by a list of the change operations, grouped by entity (schema):
    ¬†¬†¬†¬†MODIFY ENTITY entity\_name
    ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† operation
    ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†*\[*operation ...*\]*

¬†¬† *\[*MAPPED ¬† it\_mapped¬†¬† *|* DATA(it\_mapped)*\]*
¬†¬† *\[*REPORTED it\_reported *|* DATA(it\_reported)*\]*.

Effect

The dynamic form MODIFY ENTITIES OPERATIONS does not specify an introductory name of the [RAP business object](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrap_bo_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") (OF root\_name). It allows to merge operations on multiple business objects in a statement.

The line type of an operation operation has the type ABP\_BEHV\_CHANGES\_TAB and consists of following fields:

-   OP¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Type¬†¬†ABP\_BEHV\_OP\_MODIFY
    Operation: IF\_ABAP\_BEHV=>OP-M-CREATE*|*UPDATE*|*DELETE*|*EXECUTE

-   SUB\_NAME¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Type¬†¬†C¬†¬†Length¬†¬†30
    Contains the function or association name (for create-by-association); is empty otherwise.

-   INSTANCES¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Type¬†¬†REF¬†¬†TO¬†¬†DATA
    Contains the derived table type for the operation.

-   RESULTS¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Type¬†¬†REF¬†¬†TO¬†¬†DATA
    Contains the derived type for the results of an action; is empty otherwise.

The response structures FAILED, MAPPED and REPORTED must either have the matching type or be declared inline (for example REPORTED DATA(ls\_repd)). The line type of the response structures has the type ABP\_BEHV\_RESPONSE\_TAB and consists of the following fields:

-   ROOT\_NAME¬†¬†¬†¬†Type¬†¬†ABP\_ROOT\_ENTITY\_NAME

-   ENTITY\_NAME¬†¬†Type¬†¬†ABP\_ENTITY\_NAME

-   ENTRIES¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Type¬†¬†REF TO DATA
    Contains the derived table type for FAILED*|*MAPPED*|*REPORTED
    REF TO DATA contains the same derived types during runtime as in static cases.

Effect

The [EML](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeneml.htm) statement READ ENTITIES enables read operations to be made to the [CDS entities](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencds_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). It can have a long, short, or dynamic form.

-   The long form, READ ENTITIES, makes it possible to group multiple operations in multiple entities of a business object.

-   The short form [READ ENTITY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeneml_read_entity.htm) is intended for the special case where only a single entity is operated on.

-   The dynamic form [READ ENTITIES OPERATIONS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeneml_read_entities_op.htm) makes it possible to merge operations in multiple [RAP business objects](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrap_bo_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in one statement. There is no dynamic short form.

The following points apply for the syntax of the statement READ ENTITIES:

-   The name of the business object (the same as the name of the [root entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenroot_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")) root\_name is specified after OF.

-   This is followed by the list of the operations, grouped by entity (schema):
    ¬†¬†¬†¬†ENTITY entity\_name
    ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† operation
    ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†*\[*operation ...*\]*
    Grouping operations by entity is not mandatory, since ENTITY entity\_name can be repeated. The same combination of entity\_name and operation, however, cannot occur more than once.

-   The [alias](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbdl_alias.htm) of the entity should be used as entity\_name, if one is defined in the [behavior definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencds_behavior_definitions.htm). The original name of the entity can also be used instead of the alias, but this produces a warning.

-   The simple READ ENTITIES statement does not have its own keyword (such as CREATE in [MODIFY ENTITIES](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeneml_modify_entities.htm)), rather it starts directly with FROM it\_instance.

-   READ ENTITIES statements always have the addition RESULT, since the result of the read must be specified.

-   Two parameters are bound for each operation (source and target variable); in read-by-association, on the other hand, up to three variables (source and target variable and link) can be bound.

-   Read-by-Association has the following form:
    ¬†¬†¬†¬†READ BY \\association\_name FROM instances
    ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† RESULT results
    ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† LINK¬†¬† links
    Here, at least one of the target variables (results or links) must be specified. The variable results contains the target instances with all fields, whereas the variable links contains only a list of key pairs: Source key, target key. Target variables must have the appropriate type (for example, RESULT it\_result\_a) or can be declared inline (for example, RESULT DATA(it\_result\_a)).

The following applies for the response variables:

-   The response variables are structures with n component (one component for each entity of the business object).

-   Up to two variables can be specified to hold response information: FAILED and REPORTED. There are no key assignments in the statement READ ENTITIES, which is why the response structure MAPPED is not used.

-   The response variables must either have the matching type or be declared inline (for example, FAILED DATA(it\_failed)). These are the early response types (without the addition LATE). The instances are identified using the keys valid in the interaction phase.

ABAP EML - READ ENTITY

\* Work in progress \*

Syntax

READ
¬†¬†ENTITY entity\_name
¬†¬†¬†¬† FROM it\_instance
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† RESULT it\_result *|* DATA(it\_result)
¬†¬†¬†¬† BY \\assoc\_name FROM it\_instance\_rba
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† RESULT it\_result\_rba *|* DATA(it\_result\_rba)
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† LINK¬†¬† it\_link\_rba *|* DATA(it\_link\_rba)

¬†¬†¬†¬†*\[*FAILED¬†¬† it\_failed *|* DATA(it\_failed)*\]*
¬†¬†¬†¬†*\[*REPORTED it\_reported *|* DATA(it\_reported)*\]*.

Effect

The short form READ ENTITY is intended for the special case where only a single entity is operated on. In this case, access using the [RAP business object](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrap_bo_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") (the [root entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenroot_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") root\_name) would not be necessary.

The following points apply for the syntax of the statement READ ENTITY:

-   The ENTITY entity\_name is specified once.

-   An [alias](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbdl_alias.htm) of the entity cannot be used since no context of the business object is known.

-   This is followed by a list of operations on the entity according to the schema:
    ¬†¬†¬†¬†ENTITY entity\_name
    ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†operation
    ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† *\[*operation ...*\]*

ABAP EML - READ ENTITIES OPERATIONS

\* Work in progress \*

Syntax

READ ENTITIES
¬†¬†¬†¬†OPERATIONS operations
¬†¬† *\[*FAILED ¬† it\_failed *|* DATA(it\_failed)*\]*
¬†¬† *\[*REPORTED it\_reported *|* DATA(it\_reported)*\]*.

Effect

The dynamic form READ ENTITIES OPERATIONS does not specify an introductory name of the [RAP business object](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrap_bo_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") (OF root\_name). It allows to merge operations on multiple business objects in a statement.

The table type of an operation operation has the type ABP\_BEHV\_RETRIEVALS\_TAB and consists of following fields:

-   OP¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Type¬†¬†ABP\_BEHV\_OP\_MODIFY
    Operation: IF\_ABAP\_BEHV=>R\_OP-READ|READ\_BA

-   ENTITY\_NAME¬†¬† Type¬†¬†ABP\_ENTITY\_NAME

-   SUB\_NAME¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Type¬†¬†C¬†¬†Length¬†¬†30
    Contains the function or association name (for read-by-association), is empty otherwise.

-   INSTANCES¬†¬†¬†¬† Type¬†¬†REF¬†¬†TO¬†¬†DATA
    Contains the derived table type for the operation.

-   FULL¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Type¬†¬†C¬†¬†Length 1
    Flag: Retrieve target instances (not just links)

-   RESULTS¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Type¬†¬†REF¬†¬†TO¬†¬†DATA
    Contains the derived table type for the target entity.

-   LINKS¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Type¬†¬†REF¬†¬†TO¬†¬†DATA
    Contains the derived table type for the relationships between source-and target key.

The line type of the response structures FAILED and REPORTED has the type ABP\_BEHV\_RESPONSE\_TAB and consists of the following fields:

-   ROOT\_NAME¬†¬†¬†¬† Type¬†¬†ABP\_ROOT\_ENTITY\_NAME

-   ENTITY\_NAME¬†¬† Type¬†¬†ABP\_ENTITY\_NAME

-   ENTRIES¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Type¬†¬†REF TO DATA
    Contains the derived table type for FAILED*|*REPORTED

During runtime, REF TO DATA contain the same derived types as in static cases.

ABAP EML - READ ENTITIES

\* Work in progress \*

Syntax

READ ENTITIES OF root\_name
¬†¬† ENTITY entity\_1\_name
¬†¬†¬†¬† FROM it\_instance
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† RESULT it\_result *|* DATA(it\_result)
¬†¬†¬†¬† BY \\assoc\_name FROM it\_instance\_rba
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† RESULT it\_result\_rba *|* DATA(it\_result\_rba)

¬†¬† ...
¬†¬†*\[*FAILED¬†¬† it\_failed *|* DATA(it\_failed)*\]*
¬†¬†*\[*REPORTED it\_reported *|* DATA(it\_reported)*\]*.

Effect

The [EML](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeneml.htm) statement READ ENTITIES enables read operations to be made to the [CDS entities](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencds_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). It can have a long, short, or dynamic form.

-   The long form, READ ENTITIES, makes it possible to group multiple operations in multiple entities of a business object.

-   The short form [READ ENTITY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeneml_read_entity.htm) is intended for the special case where only a single entity is operated on.

-   The dynamic form [READ ENTITIES OPERATIONS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeneml_read_entities_op.htm) makes it possible to merge operations in multiple [RAP business objects](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrap_bo_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in one statement. There is no dynamic short form.

The following points apply for the syntax of the statement READ ENTITIES:

-   The name of the business object (the same as the name of the [root entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenroot_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")) root\_name is specified after OF.

-   This is followed by the list of the operations, grouped by entity (schema):
    ¬†¬†¬†¬†ENTITY entity\_name
    ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† operation
    ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†*\[*operation ...*\]*
    Grouping operations by entity is not mandatory, since ENTITY entity\_name can be repeated. The same combination of entity\_name and operation, however, cannot occur more than once.

-   The [alias](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbdl_alias.htm) of the entity should be used as entity\_name, if one is defined in the [behavior definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencds_behavior_definitions.htm). The original name of the entity can also be used instead of the alias, but this produces a warning.

-   The simple READ ENTITIES statement does not have its own keyword (such as CREATE in [MODIFY ENTITIES](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeneml_modify_entities.htm)), rather it starts directly with FROM it\_instance.

-   READ ENTITIES statements always have the addition RESULT, since the result of the read must be specified.

-   Two parameters are bound for each operation (source and target variable); in read-by-association, on the other hand, up to three variables (source and target variable and link) can be bound.

-   Read-by-Association has the following form:
    ¬†¬†¬†¬†READ BY \\association\_name FROM instances
    ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† RESULT results
    ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† LINK¬†¬† links
    Here, at least one of the target variables (results or links) must be specified. The variable results contains the target instances with all fields, whereas the variable links contains only a list of key pairs: Source key, target key. Target variables must have the appropriate type (for example, RESULT it\_result\_a) or can be declared inline (for example, RESULT DATA(it\_result\_a)).

The following applies for the response variables:

-   The response variables are structures with n component (one component for each entity of the business object).

-   Up to two variables can be specified to hold response information: FAILED and REPORTED. There are no key assignments in the statement READ ENTITIES, which is why the response structure MAPPED is not used.

-   The response variables must either have the matching type or be declared inline (for example, FAILED DATA(it\_failed)). These are the early response types (without the addition LATE). The instances are identified using the keys valid in the interaction phase.

ABAP EML - COMMIT ENTITIES

\* Work in progress \*

Syntax

COMMIT ENTITIES
¬†¬†*\[*RESPONSE OF root\_name\_1
¬†¬†¬†¬†*\[*FAILED¬†¬†¬†¬†it\_failed¬†¬† *|* DATA(it\_failed)*\]*
¬†¬†¬†¬†*\[*REPORTED¬†¬†it\_reported *|* DATA(it\_reported)*\]**\]*
¬†¬†*\[*RESPONSE OF root\_name\_2

¬† ¬†¬†*\[*REPORTED¬†¬†it\_reported *|* DATA(it\_reported)*\]**\]*.

Effect

If MODIFY statements are not executed within a [behavior pool](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbehavior_pool_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and are executed by an ABAP report instead, they would be ignored by the database at first. This is because they are applied only to the transactional buffer (by definition) and the buffer content disappears at the end of the ABAP session. This means the save sequence must be triggered in this scenario. The statement COMMIT ENTITIES is used to do this.

The statement COMMIT ENTITIES saves all [RAP business objects](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrap_bo_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that are changed within the [LUW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenluw_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

In its simplest form, the statement COMMIT ENTITIES does not have any parameters.

RESPONSE can be used to obtain the response information of one or more business objects manipulated previously using [MODIFY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeneml_modify_entities.htm). A RESPONSE clause is then created for each root entity involved (root\_name\_1, root\_name\_2, ...):

The response variables are structures with n component (one component for each entity in the business object). Up to two variables can be specified for holding the response information for each [root entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenroot_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in question. FAILED and REPORTED. There are no key assignments in the statement COMMIT, which is why the response structure MAPPED is not used. The response variables must either have the matching type (for example, FAILED it\_failed) or be declared inline (for example, FAILED DATA(it\_failed)). These are the late response types: Instances are identified using the keys valid in the save phase.

The line type of the response structures FAILED and REPORTED has the type ABP\_BEHV\_RESPONSE\_TAB and consists of the following fields:

-   ROOT\_NAME¬†¬†¬†¬† Type¬†¬†ABP\_ROOT\_ENTITY\_NAME

-   ENTITY\_NAME¬†¬† Type¬†¬†ABP\_ENTITY\_NAME

-   ENTRIES¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Type¬†¬†REF TO DATA
    Contains the derived table type for FAILED*|*REPORTED

Statement successful if sy-subrc is 0. It is not enough to evaluate the result of FAILED.

Note

Within a [behavior implementation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_behavior_pools.htm), COMMIT ENTITIES is one of the forbidden statements. This restriction is also checked dynamically. If violated, the runtime error BEHAVIOR\_ILLEGAL\_STATEMENT occurs.

ABAP EML - COMMIT ENTITIES

\* Work in progress \*

Syntax

COMMIT ENTITIES
¬†¬†*\[*RESPONSE OF root\_name\_1
¬†¬†¬†¬†*\[*FAILED¬†¬†¬†¬†it\_failed¬†¬† *|* DATA(it\_failed)*\]*
¬†¬†¬†¬†*\[*REPORTED¬†¬†it\_reported *|* DATA(it\_reported)*\]**\]*
¬†¬†*\[*RESPONSE OF root\_name\_2
¬†¬†¬†¬†*\[*FAILED ¬†¬†¬†it\_failed¬†¬† *|* DATA(it\_failed)*\]*
¬† ¬†¬†*\[*REPORTED¬†¬†it\_reported *|* DATA(it\_reported)*\]**\]*.

Effect

If MODIFY statements are not executed within a [behavior pool](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbehavior_pool_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and are executed by an ABAP report instead, they would be ignored by the database at first. This is because they are applied only to the transactional buffer (by definition) and the buffer content disappears at the end of the ABAP session. This means the save sequence must be triggered in this scenario. The statement COMMIT ENTITIES is used to do this.

The statement COMMIT ENTITIES saves all [RAP business objects](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrap_bo_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that are changed within the [LUW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenluw_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

In its simplest form, the statement COMMIT ENTITIES does not have any parameters.

RESPONSE can be used to obtain the response information of one or more business objects manipulated previously using [MODIFY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeneml_modify_entities.htm). A RESPONSE clause is then created for each root entity involved (root\_name\_1, root\_name\_2, ...):

The response variables are structures with n component (one component for each entity in the business object). Up to two variables can be specified for holding the response information for each [root entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenroot_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in question. FAILED and REPORTED. There are no key assignments in the statement COMMIT, which is why the response structure MAPPED is not used. The response variables must either have the matching type (for example, FAILED it\_failed) or be declared inline (for example, FAILED DATA(it\_failed)). These are the late response types: Instances are identified using the keys valid in the save phase.

The line type of the response structures FAILED and REPORTED has the type ABP\_BEHV\_RESPONSE\_TAB and consists of the following fields:

-   ROOT\_NAME¬†¬†¬†¬† Type¬†¬†ABP\_ROOT\_ENTITY\_NAME

-   ENTITY\_NAME¬†¬† Type¬†¬†ABP\_ENTITY\_NAME

-   ENTRIES¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Type¬†¬†REF TO DATA
    Contains the derived table type for FAILED*|*REPORTED

Statement successful if sy-subrc is 0. It is not enough to evaluate the result of FAILED.

Note

Within a [behavior implementation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_behavior_pools.htm), COMMIT ENTITIES is one of the forbidden statements. This restriction is also checked dynamically. If violated, the runtime error BEHAVIOR\_ILLEGAL\_STATEMENT occurs.

ABAP EML - CONVERT KEY

\* Work in progress \*

Syntax

COMMIT ENTITIES BEGIN
¬†¬†...
¬†¬†CONVERT KEY OF entity\_name
¬†¬†FROM pre\_key
¬†¬†TO¬†¬† key.
COMMIT ENTITIES END.

Effect

For entities with [late numbering](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbdl_late_numbering.htm), the statement [MODIFY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhandler_method_modify.htm) provides only temporary keys. For these temporary keys, a successful save method draws finalized keys. If, for example, the keys of new instances are passed to a HTTP response, they must be the finalized values and not the temporary values from the MODIFY phase. The statement CONVERT KEY is used for this.

The statement CONVERT KEY may only be used in the context of a block-constructing variant of the statement [COMMIT ENTITIES](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeneml_commit_block.htm) to determine the finalized value of a temporary key. In the context of the statement COMMIT ENTITIES, the runtime of [ABAP RAP](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_rap_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") holds its key registry to respond to queries from the statement CONVERT KEY. In the statement COMMIT ENTITIES END, this information is then deleted.

In its dynamic form, the statement CONVERT KEY is passed the name of the entity and does not perform a static type check.

Remarks

-   Unlike the other [EML](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeneml.htm) statements, CONVERT KEY does not operate on tables. This is because the consumer typically iterates across the consumer's own data and needs to fill specific columns. The preceding extraction of all pre\_key, following by a mass conversion and insertion of keys in the target table would be more time-consuming and use more resources than repeating the direct individual operation.

-   Within a [behavior implementation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_behavior_pools.htm), the statement CONVERT KEY is allowed only in the [SAVE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abensaver_method_save.htm) method. If this rule is violated, the runtime error BEHAVIOR\_ILLEGAL\_STATEMENT occurs.

\* Work in progress \*

Syntax

ROLLBACK ENTITIES.

Effect

The statement ROLLBACK ENTITIES rolls back all changes since the last COMMIT and resets the transactional buffer..

Using the statement ROLLBACK ENTITIES is prohibited in the [behavior implementation methods](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_behavior_pools.htm). If violated, a runtime error occurs.

ABAP EML - SET LOCKS

\* Work in progress \*

Syntax

SET LOCKS OF root\_name
¬†¬† ENTITY entity\_1\_name FROM lt1
¬†¬†*\[*ENTITY entity\_2\_name FROM lt2 ...*\]*
¬†¬†*\[*FAILED¬†¬† it\_failed*\]*

SET LOCKS
¬†¬† ENTITY entity\_name FROM lt
¬†¬†*\[*FAILED it\_failed*\]*
¬†¬†*\[*REPORTED it\_reported*\]*.

Effect

The explicit locking of instances for a following modification is not necessary since the framework automatically locks instances contained in the method [MODIFY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhandler_method_modify.htm). However, if the application knows that instances will be needed (that need to be protected so that users cannot change the same data simultaneously), the SET LOCKS statement can be used.

Two types of the statement SET LOCKS are available:

-   a long form SET LOCKS OF root\_name

-   a short form SET LOCKS.

The table types required here can be declared statically using the syntax TYPE ... TABLE FOR LOCK OF (see [Derived Types](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrpm_derived_types.htm)).

ABAP Entity Manipulation Language

\* Work in progress \*

Entity Manipulation Language (or EML for short) is a set of ABAP statements for manipulating the [CDS entities](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencds_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that are granted a behavior by the [behavior definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencds_behavior_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). EML statements allow:

-   Modifying operations on CDS entities.
    For this purpose, the statement MODIFY ENTITIES is available in different variants, which reference one or more entities of a [RAP business object](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrap_bo_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), statically or dynamically: [MODIFY ENTITIES](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeneml_modify_entities.htm), [MODIFY ENTITY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeneml_modify_entity.htm) and [MODIFY ENTITIES OPERATIONS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeneml_modify_entities_op.htm).

-   Read operations on CDS entities.
    For this purpose, the statement READ ENTITIES is available in different variants, which reference one or more entities of a business object, statically or dynamically: [READ ENTITIES](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenread_behavior.htm), [READ ENTITY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeneml_read_entity.htm) and [READ ENTITIES OPERATIONS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeneml_read_entities_op.htm).

-   Triggering the saver sequence.
    For this purpose the statement [COMMIT ENTITIES](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeneml_commit_entities.htm) is available in different variants: COMMIT ENTITIES and COMMIT ENTITIES RESPONSES.

-   Handling the result of the [adjust\_numbers](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abensaver_adjust_numbers.htm) method.
    For this purpose there is the block-constructing variant of COMMIT ENTITIES and the [CONVERT KEY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconvert_key.htm) statement.

-   Rolling back all changes since the last COMMIT.
    For this purpose there is the [ROLLBACK ENTITIES](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeneml_rollback_entities.htm) statement.

-   Explicit locking of instances for a following modification.
    For this purpose the statement [SET LOCKS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeneml_set_locks.htm) is available in different variants: SET LOCKS OF and SET LOCKS ENTITY.

If the IMPORT table is empty, the method is not called.

ABAP EML - MODIFY ENTITIES

\* Work in progress \*

Syntax

MODIFY ENTITIES OF root\_name
¬†¬†ENTITY entity\_1\_name
¬†¬†¬†¬†CREATE FROM it\_instance
¬†¬†¬†¬†CREATE BY \\assoc\_name FROM it\_instance\_cba
¬†¬†¬†¬†UPDATE FROM it\_instance\_u
¬†¬†¬†¬†DELETE FROM it\_instance\_d
¬†¬†¬†¬†EXECUTE action\_name FROM it\_instance\_a

¬†¬†*\[*MAPPED¬†¬† it\_mapped *|* DATA(it\_mapped)*\]*
¬†¬†*\[*REPORTED it\_reported *|* DATA(it\_reported)*\]*.

Effect

EML is ABAP.

The [EML](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeneml.htm) statement MODIFY ENTITIES enables change operations to be made to the [CDS entities](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencds_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). It can have a long, short, or dynamic form.

-   The long form, MODIFY ENTITIES, makes it possible to group multiple operations in multiple entities of a business object.

-   The short form [MODIFY ENTITY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeneml_modify_entity.htm) is intended for the special case where only a single entity is operated on.

-   The dynamic form [MODIFY ENTITIES OPERATIONS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeneml_modify_entities_op.htm) makes it possible to merge operations in multiple business objects in one MODIFY statement. There is no dynamic short form.

The following points apply for the syntax of the statement MODIFY ENTITIES:

-   The name of the business object (the same as the name of the [root entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenroot_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")) root\_name is specified after OF. This is followed by a list of the operations, grouped by the entity (the schema):
    ENTITY entity\_name operation *\[*operation ...*\]*

-   Grouping operations by entity is not mandatory, since ENTITY entity\_name can be repeated. The same combination of entity\_name and operation, however, cannot occur more than once.

-   The [alias](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbdl_alias.htm) of the entity should be used as entity\_name, if one is defined in the behavior definition . The original name of the entity can also be used instead of the alias, but this produces a warning.

-   The input of each operation is a table of instances (or a table from [%CID](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencomponents_derived_types.htm) in the case of static actions) specified after FROM.

-   For [actions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbdl_action.htm) that produce a result (in accordance with the [behavior definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencds_behavior_definitions.htm)), RESULT ... can be used to specify a target variable it\_result\_a or declare it inline (for example, RESULT DATA(it\_result\_a)).

The following applies to the response variables:

-   The response variables are structures with n components (one component per entity in the business object) that are specified for the derived type of the [output parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrpm_export_parameters.htm).

-   They must either have the matching type (for example, FAILED it\_failed) or be declared inline (for example, FAILED DATA(it\_failed)).

-   Up to three response variables can be specified to hold response information: FAILED, MAPPED, and REPORTED.

-   These are the early response types (without the addition [LATE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbdl_late_numbering.htm)). The instances are identified using the keys valid in the modifying phase.

¬†¬†*\[*MAPPED¬†¬† it\_mapped *|* DATA(it\_mapped)*\]*
¬†¬†*\[*REPORTED it\_reported *|* DATA(it\_reported)*\]*.

Effect

The short form MODIFY ENTITY is intended for the special case where only a single entity is operated on. In this case, access via the [RAP business object](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrap_bo_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") (the [root entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenroot_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") root\_name) is not necessary.

The following points apply for the syntax of the statement MODIFY ENTITY:

-   The ENTITY entity\_name is specified once.

-   An alias of the entity cannot be used since no context of the business object is known.

-   This is followed by a list of the change operations, grouped by entity (schema):
    ¬†¬†¬†¬†MODIFY ENTITY entity\_name
    ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† operation
    ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†*\[*operation ...*\]*

¬†¬† *\[*MAPPED ¬† it\_mapped¬†¬† *|* DATA(it\_mapped)*\]*
¬†¬† *\[*REPORTED it\_reported *|* DATA(it\_reported)*\]*.

Effect

The dynamic form MODIFY ENTITIES OPERATIONS does not specify an introductory name of the [RAP business object](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrap_bo_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") (OF root\_name). It allows to merge operations on multiple business objects in a statement.

The line type of an operation operation has the type ABP\_BEHV\_CHANGES\_TAB and consists of following fields:

-   OP¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Type¬†¬†ABP\_BEHV\_OP\_MODIFY
    Operation: IF\_ABAP\_BEHV=>OP-M-CREATE*|*UPDATE*|*DELETE*|*EXECUTE

-   SUB\_NAME¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Type¬†¬†C¬†¬†Length¬†¬†30
    Contains the function or association name (for create-by-association); is empty otherwise.

-   INSTANCES¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Type¬†¬†REF¬†¬†TO¬†¬†DATA
    Contains the derived table type for the operation.

-   RESULTS¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Type¬†¬†REF¬†¬†TO¬†¬†DATA
    Contains the derived type for the results of an action; is empty otherwise.

The response structures FAILED, MAPPED and REPORTED must either have the matching type or be declared inline (for example REPORTED DATA(ls\_repd)). The line type of the response structures has the type ABP\_BEHV\_RESPONSE\_TAB and consists of the following fields:

-   ROOT\_NAME¬†¬†¬†¬†Type¬†¬†ABP\_ROOT\_ENTITY\_NAME

-   ENTITY\_NAME¬†¬†Type¬†¬†ABP\_ENTITY\_NAME

-   ENTRIES¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Type¬†¬†REF TO DATA
    Contains the derived table type for FAILED*|*MAPPED*|*REPORTED
    REF TO DATA contains the same derived types during runtime as in static cases.

ABAP EML - READ ENTITIES

\* Work in progress \*

Syntax

READ ENTITIES OF root\_name
¬†¬† ENTITY entity\_1\_name
¬†¬†¬†¬† FROM it\_instance
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† RESULT it\_result *|* DATA(it\_result)
¬†¬†¬†¬† BY \\assoc\_name FROM it\_instance\_rba

¬†¬† ...
¬†¬†*\[*FAILED¬†¬† it\_failed *|* DATA(it\_failed)*\]*
¬†¬†*\[*REPORTED it\_reported *|* DATA(it\_reported)*\]*.

Effect

The [EML](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeneml.htm) statement READ ENTITIES enables read operations to be made to the [CDS entities](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencds_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). It can have a long, short, or dynamic form.

-   The long form, READ ENTITIES, makes it possible to group multiple operations in multiple entities of a business object.

-   The short form [READ ENTITY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeneml_read_entity.htm) is intended for the special case where only a single entity is operated on.

-   The dynamic form [READ ENTITIES OPERATIONS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeneml_read_entities_op.htm) makes it possible to merge operations in multiple [RAP business objects](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrap_bo_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in one statement. There is no dynamic short form.

The following points apply for the syntax of the statement READ ENTITIES:

-   The name of the business object (the same as the name of the [root entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenroot_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")) root\_name is specified after OF.

-   This is followed by the list of the operations, grouped by entity (schema):
    ¬†¬†¬†¬†ENTITY entity\_name
    ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† operation
    ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†*\[*operation ...*\]*
    Grouping operations by entity is not mandatory, since ENTITY entity\_name can be repeated. The same combination of entity\_name and operation, however, cannot occur more than once.

-   The [alias](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbdl_alias.htm) of the entity should be used as entity\_name, if one is defined in the [behavior definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencds_behavior_definitions.htm). The original name of the entity can also be used instead of the alias, but this produces a warning.

-   The simple READ ENTITIES statement does not have its own keyword (such as CREATE in [MODIFY ENTITIES](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeneml_modify_entities.htm)), rather it starts directly with FROM it\_instance.

-   READ ENTITIES statements always have the addition RESULT, since the result of the read must be specified.

-   Two parameters are bound for each operation (source and target variable); in read-by-association, on the other hand, up to three variables (source and target variable and link) can be bound.

-   Read-by-Association has the following form:
    ¬†¬†¬†¬†READ BY \\association\_name FROM instances
    ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† RESULT results
    ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† LINK¬†¬† links
    Here, at least one of the target variables (results or links) must be specified. The variable results contains the target instances with all fields, whereas the variable links contains only a list of key pairs: Source key, target key. Target variables must have the appropriate type (for example, RESULT it\_result\_a) or can be declared inline (for example, RESULT DATA(it\_result\_a)).

The following applies for the response variables:

-   The response variables are structures with n component (one component for each entity of the business object).

-   Up to two variables can be specified to hold response information: FAILED and REPORTED. There are no key assignments in the statement READ ENTITIES, which is why the response structure MAPPED is not used.

-   The response variables must either have the matching type or be declared inline (for example, FAILED DATA(it\_failed)). These are the early response types (without the addition LATE). The instances are identified using the keys valid in the interaction phase.

ABAP EML - READ ENTITY

\* Work in progress \*

Syntax

READ
¬†¬†ENTITY entity\_name
¬†¬†¬†¬† FROM it\_instance
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† RESULT it\_result *|* DATA(it\_result)
¬†¬†¬†¬† BY \\assoc\_name FROM it\_instance\_rba

¬†¬†¬†¬†*\[*FAILED¬†¬† it\_failed *|* DATA(it\_failed)*\]*
¬†¬†¬†¬†*\[*REPORTED it\_reported *|* DATA(it\_reported)*\]*.

Effect

The short form READ ENTITY is intended for the special case where only a single entity is operated on. In this case, access using the [RAP business object](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrap_bo_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") (the [root entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenroot_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") root\_name) would not be necessary.

The following points apply for the syntax of the statement READ ENTITY:

-   The ENTITY entity\_name is specified once.

-   An [alias](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbdl_alias.htm) of the entity cannot be used since no context of the business object is known.

-   This is followed by a list of operations on the entity according to the schema:
    ¬†¬†¬†¬†ENTITY entity\_name
    ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†operation
    ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† *\[*operation ...*\]*

Syntax

READ ENTITIES
¬†¬†¬†¬†OPERATIONS operations
¬†¬† *\[*FAILED ¬† it\_failed *|* DATA(it\_failed)*\]*
¬†¬† *\[*REPORTED it\_reported *|* DATA(it\_reported)*\]*.

Effect

The dynamic form READ ENTITIES OPERATIONS does not specify an introductory name of the [RAP business object](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrap_bo_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") (OF root\_name). It allows to merge operations on multiple business objects in a statement.

The table type of an operation operation has the type ABP\_BEHV\_RETRIEVALS\_TAB and consists of following fields:

-   OP¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Type¬†¬†ABP\_BEHV\_OP\_MODIFY
    Operation: IF\_ABAP\_BEHV=>R\_OP-READ|READ\_BA

-   SUB\_NAME¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Type¬†¬†C¬†¬†Length¬†¬†30
    Contains the function or association name (for read-by-association), is empty otherwise.

-   INSTANCES¬†¬†¬†¬† Type¬†¬†REF¬†¬†TO¬†¬†DATA
    Contains the derived table type for the operation.

-   FULL¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Type¬†¬†C¬†¬†Length 1
    Flag: Retrieve target instances (not just links)

-   RESULTS¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Type¬†¬†REF¬†¬†TO¬†¬†DATA
    Contains the derived table type for the target entity.

-   LINKS¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Type¬†¬†REF¬†¬†TO¬†¬†DATA
    Contains the derived table type for the relationships between source-and target key.

The line type of the response structures FAILED and REPORTED has the type ABP\_BEHV\_RESPONSE\_TAB and consists of the following fields:

-   ROOT\_NAME¬†¬†¬†¬† Type¬†¬†ABP\_ROOT\_ENTITY\_NAME

-   ENTITY\_NAME¬†¬† Type¬†¬†ABP\_ENTITY\_NAME

-   ENTRIES¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Type¬†¬†REF TO DATA

Effect

The [EML](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeneml.htm) statement READ ENTITIES enables read operations to be made to the [CDS entities](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencds_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). It can have a long, short, or dynamic form.

-   The long form, READ ENTITIES, makes it possible to group multiple operations in multiple entities of a business object.

-   The short form [READ ENTITY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeneml_read_entity.htm) is intended for the special case where only a single entity is operated on.

-   The dynamic form [READ ENTITIES OPERATIONS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeneml_read_entities_op.htm) makes it possible to merge operations in multiple [RAP business objects](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrap_bo_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in one statement. There is no dynamic short form.

The following points apply for the syntax of the statement READ ENTITIES:

-   The name of the business object (the same as the name of the [root entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenroot_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")) root\_name is specified after OF.

-   This is followed by the list of the operations, grouped by entity (schema):
    ¬†¬†¬†¬†ENTITY entity\_name
    ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† operation
    ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†*\[*operation ...*\]*
    Grouping operations by entity is not mandatory, since ENTITY entity\_name can be repeated. The same combination of entity\_name and operation, however, cannot occur more than once.

-   The [alias](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbdl_alias.htm) of the entity should be used as entity\_name, if one is defined in the [behavior definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencds_behavior_definitions.htm). The original name of the entity can also be used instead of the alias, but this produces a warning.

-   The simple READ ENTITIES statement does not have its own keyword (such as CREATE in [MODIFY ENTITIES](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeneml_modify_entities.htm)), rather it starts directly with FROM it\_instance.

-   READ ENTITIES statements always have the addition RESULT, since the result of the read must be specified.

-   Two parameters are bound for each operation (source and target variable); in read-by-association, on the other hand, up to three variables (source and target variable and link) can be bound.

-   Read-by-Association has the following form:
    ¬†¬†¬†¬†READ BY \\association\_name FROM instances
    ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† RESULT results
    ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† LINK¬†¬† links
    Here, at least one of the target variables (results or links) must be specified. The variable results contains the target instances with all fields, whereas the variable links contains only a list of key pairs: Source key, target key. Target variables must have the appropriate type (for example, RESULT it\_result\_a) or can be declared inline (for example, RESULT DATA(it\_result\_a)).

The following applies for the response variables:

-   The response variables are structures with n component (one component for each entity of the business object).

-   Up to two variables can be specified to hold response information: FAILED and REPORTED. There are no key assignments in the statement READ ENTITIES, which is why the response structure MAPPED is not used.

-   The response variables must either have the matching type or be declared inline (for example, FAILED DATA(it\_failed)). These are the early response types (without the addition LATE). The instances are identified using the keys valid in the interaction phase.

ABAP EML - COMMIT ENTITIES

\* Work in progress \*

Syntax

COMMIT ENTITIES
¬†¬†*\[*RESPONSE OF root\_name\_1
¬†¬†¬†¬†*\[*FAILED¬†¬†¬†¬†it\_failed¬†¬† *|* DATA(it\_failed)*\]*
¬†¬†¬†¬†*\[*REPORTED¬†¬†it\_reported *|* DATA(it\_reported)*\]**\]*
¬†¬†*\[*RESPONSE OF root\_name\_2

¬† ¬†¬†*\[*REPORTED¬†¬†it\_reported *|* DATA(it\_reported)*\]**\]*.

Effect

If MODIFY statements are not executed within a [behavior pool](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbehavior_pool_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and are executed by an ABAP report instead, they would be ignored by the database at first. This is because they are applied only to the transactional buffer (by definition) and the buffer content disappears at the end of the ABAP session. This means the save sequence must be triggered in this scenario. The statement COMMIT ENTITIES is used to do this.

The statement COMMIT ENTITIES saves all [RAP business objects](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrap_bo_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that are changed within the [LUW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenluw_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

In its simplest form, the statement COMMIT ENTITIES does not have any parameters.

RESPONSE can be used to obtain the response information of one or more business objects manipulated previously using [MODIFY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeneml_modify_entities.htm). A RESPONSE clause is then created for each root entity involved (root\_name\_1, root\_name\_2, ...):

The response variables are structures with n component (one component for each entity in the business object). Up to two variables can be specified for holding the response information for each [root entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenroot_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in question. FAILED and REPORTED. There are no key assignments in the statement COMMIT, which is why the response structure MAPPED is not used. The response variables must either have the matching type (for example, FAILED it\_failed) or be declared inline (for example, FAILED DATA(it\_failed)). These are the late response types: Instances are identified using the keys valid in the save phase.

The line type of the response structures FAILED and REPORTED has the type ABP\_BEHV\_RESPONSE\_TAB and consists of the following fields:

-   ROOT\_NAME¬†¬†¬†¬† Type¬†¬†ABP\_ROOT\_ENTITY\_NAME

-   ENTITY\_NAME¬†¬† Type¬†¬†ABP\_ENTITY\_NAME

-   ENTRIES¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Type¬†¬†REF TO DATA
    Contains the derived table type for FAILED*|*REPORTED

Statement successful if sy-subrc is 0. It is not enough to evaluate the result of FAILED.

Note

\* Work in progress \*

Syntax

COMMIT ENTITIES
¬†¬†RESPONSES *\[*OF root\_names*\]*
¬†¬†¬†¬†*\[*FAILED¬†¬† it\_failed *|* DATA(it\_failed)*\]*
¬†¬†¬†¬†*\[*REPORTED it\_reported *|* DATA(it\_reported)*\]*.

Effect

The statement COMMIT ENTITIES RESPONSES is a dynamic form of the COMMIT statement. The table root\_names can be used to restrict which business objects are given the response information in FAILED and REPORTED. If not used, all information accumulated in the save phase is passed.

ABAP EML - COMMIT ENTITIES

\* Work in progress \*

Syntax

COMMIT ENTITIES
¬†¬†*\[*RESPONSE OF root\_name\_1
¬†¬†¬†¬†*\[*FAILED¬†¬†¬†¬†it\_failed¬†¬† *|* DATA(it\_failed)*\]*
¬†¬†¬†¬†*\[*REPORTED¬†¬†it\_reported *|* DATA(it\_reported)*\]**\]*

¬† ¬†¬†*\[*REPORTED¬†¬†it\_reported *|* DATA(it\_reported)*\]**\]*.

Effect

If MODIFY statements are not executed within a [behavior pool](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbehavior_pool_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and are executed by an ABAP report instead, they would be ignored by the database at first. This is because they are applied only to the transactional buffer (by definition) and the buffer content disappears at the end of the ABAP session. This means the save sequence must be triggered in this scenario. The statement COMMIT ENTITIES is used to do this.

The statement COMMIT ENTITIES saves all [RAP business objects](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrap_bo_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that are changed within the [LUW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenluw_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

In its simplest form, the statement COMMIT ENTITIES does not have any parameters.

RESPONSE can be used to obtain the response information of one or more business objects manipulated previously using [MODIFY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeneml_modify_entities.htm). A RESPONSE clause is then created for each root entity involved (root\_name\_1, root\_name\_2, ...):

The response variables are structures with n component (one component for each entity in the business object). Up to two variables can be specified for holding the response information for each [root entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenroot_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in question. FAILED and REPORTED. There are no key assignments in the statement COMMIT, which is why the response structure MAPPED is not used. The response variables must either have the matching type (for example, FAILED it\_failed) or be declared inline (for example, FAILED DATA(it\_failed)). These are the late response types: Instances are identified using the keys valid in the save phase.

The line type of the response structures FAILED and REPORTED has the type ABP\_BEHV\_RESPONSE\_TAB and consists of the following fields:

-   ROOT\_NAME¬†¬†¬†¬† Type¬†¬†ABP\_ROOT\_ENTITY\_NAME

-   ENTITY\_NAME¬†¬† Type¬†¬†ABP\_ENTITY\_NAME

-   ENTRIES¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Type¬†¬†REF TO DATA
    Contains the derived table type for FAILED*|*REPORTED

Statement successful if sy-subrc is 0. It is not enough to evaluate the result of FAILED.

Note

Within a [behavior implementation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_behavior_pools.htm), COMMIT ENTITIES is one of the forbidden statements. This restriction is also checked dynamically. If violated, the runtime error BEHAVIOR\_ILLEGAL\_STATEMENT occurs.

ABAP EML - CONVERT KEY

\* Work in progress \*

Syntax

COMMIT ENTITIES BEGIN
¬†¬†...
¬†¬†CONVERT KEY OF entity\_name
¬†¬†FROM pre\_key
¬†¬†TO¬†¬† key.
COMMIT ENTITIES END.

Effect

For entities with [late numbering](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbdl_late_numbering.htm), the statement [MODIFY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhandler_method_modify.htm) provides only temporary keys. For these temporary keys, a successful save method draws finalized keys. If, for example, the keys of new instances are passed to a HTTP response, they must be the finalized values and not the temporary values from the MODIFY phase. The statement CONVERT KEY is used for this.

The statement CONVERT KEY may only be used in the context of a block-constructing variant of the statement [COMMIT ENTITIES](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeneml_commit_block.htm) to determine the finalized value of a temporary key. In the context of the statement COMMIT ENTITIES, the runtime of [ABAP RAP](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_rap_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") holds its key registry to respond to queries from the statement CONVERT KEY. In the statement COMMIT ENTITIES END, this information is then deleted.

In its dynamic form, the statement CONVERT KEY is passed the name of the entity and does not perform a static type check.

Remarks

-   Unlike the other [EML](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeneml.htm) statements, CONVERT KEY does not operate on tables. This is because the consumer typically iterates across the consumer's own data and needs to fill specific columns. The preceding extraction of all pre\_key, following by a mass conversion and insertion of keys in the target table would be more time-consuming and use more resources than repeating the direct individual operation.

-   Within a [behavior implementation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_behavior_pools.htm), the statement CONVERT KEY is allowed only in the [SAVE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abensaver_method_save.htm) method. If this rule is violated, the runtime error BEHAVIOR\_ILLEGAL\_STATEMENT occurs.

¬†¬†*\[*FAILED it\_failed*\]*

Effect

The explicit locking of instances for a following modification is not necessary since the framework automatically locks instances contained in the method [MODIFY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhandler_method_modify.htm). However, if the application knows that instances will be needed (that need to be protected so that users cannot change the same data simultaneously), the SET LOCKS statement can be used.

Two types of the statement SET LOCKS are available:

-   a long form SET LOCKS OF root\_name

-   a short form SET LOCKS.

The table types required here can be declared statically using the syntax TYPE ... TABLE FOR LOCK OF (see [Derived Types](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrpm_derived_types.htm)).

Messages - System Interface IF\_T100\_MESSAGE

The interface IF\_T100\_MESSAGE links classes with [messages](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenmessage_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). Classes that implement that interface can be used to access and send messages. For that purpose, IF\_T100\_MESSAGE contains a structured attribute T100KEY of the type SCX\_T100KEY. In a class that implements the interface, the contents of this structure specify a [message](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenmessage_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in the database table T100:

-   The contents of component MSGID specifies the [message class](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenmessage_class_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

-   The contents of component MSGNO specifies the [message number](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenmessage_number_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

-   The contents of components ATTR1 to ATTR4 specify names of attributes of the implementing class whose content is used as placeholder texts for the possible placeholders in the texts of the message.

Using an implementing class, the message text can be accessed as follows:

-   The interface IF\_T100\_MESSAGE includes the interface IF\_MESSAGE, which should not be used as a standalone interface. This interface contains the methods GET\_TEXT and GET\_LONGTEXT, which can be implemented by a class with the interface IF\_T100\_MESSAGE in such a way that they return the short text and long text of the current message. For that the corresponding methods of the class CL\_MESSAGE\_HELPER can be used.

-   In the variant [MESSAGE oref](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmessage_msg.htm) of the statement [MESSAGE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmessage.htm), an [interface reference variable](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeninterface_ref_variable_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the type IF\_T100\_MESSAGE or a [class reference variable](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenclass_reference_variabl_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of a class that implements this interface can be specified to send the message that is specified by the contents of the structure T100KEY.

For that, the statement MESSAGE or the class CL\_MESSAGE\_HELPER evaluates the content of the structure T100KEY as follows:

-   In database table T100, a message is searched whose message class and message number correspond to the The components MSGID and MSGNO of the structure T100KEY. If a message is found, its texts are used. If not, a short text is generated that lists the message class and message number as well as the placeholder texts from the class attributes that are specified in the structure.

-   The possible placeholders "&1" to "&4" and "&" of the short text or "&V1&" to "&V4&" of the long text of the message are replaced by the content of the class attributes specified in the components ATTR1 to ATTR4 of structure T100KEY in accordance with the rules of the addition [WITH](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmessage.htm) of the statement [MESSAGE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmessage.htm). If an attribute specified in the components ATTR1 to ATTR4 does not exist or if the contents of an attribute cannot be converted to a placeholder text, the character "&" is added to the start and the end of the attribute name and the resulting string is used as the placeholder text. If one of the components ATTR1 to ATTR4 is initial, the corresponding placeholder text is initialized.

Hints

-   The interface IF\_T100\_MESSAGE is mainly designed for use with [exception texts](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenexception_texts.htm) in [exception classes](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenexception_class_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). If the interface is implemented in regular classes and in local exception classes, the filling of the interface structure T100KEY must be programmed here explicitly. For global exception classes, however, the implementation of the interface methods GET\_TEXT and GET\_LONGTEXT is already contained in the superclass CX\_ROOT and alias names are declared for these methods there. When creating global exception classes, tool support is provided for filling the structure T100KEY and for mapping attributes to placeholders. This is done using structured constants that can be specified when an exception is raised.

-   Be aware, that with interface IF\_T100\_MESSAGE there is a double indirection for the possible placeholders of a message. The text for a placeholder is taken from an attribute of the implementing class whose name is itself contained in a component of structure T100KEY.

-   The method GET\_LATEST\_T100\_EXCEPTION in the class CL\_MESSAGE\_HELPER can be used to return the last object in a chain of exception objects (linked by the attribute PREVIOUS) that has an [exception text](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenexception_texts.htm) defined by a message.

-   The interface IF\_T100\_MESSAGE does not have any attributes for the message type.

-   The interface [IF\_T100\_DYN\_MSG](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenif_t100_dyn_msg.htm) adds predefined attributes for the message type and the placeholders of the message to the interface IF\_T100\_MESSAGE. While IF\_T100\_MESSAGE is designed for static [exception texts](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenexception_texts.htm) of exception classes, IF\_T100\_DYN\_MSG can [bind](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenmessage_exceptions.htm) any messages to exception classes.

Example

Raising an exception of the class CX\_DEMO\_T100, which implements the interface IF\_T100\_MESSAGE by using [THROW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconditional_expression_result.htm).

Description

Objects in the example class msg can represent any messages from the table T100 and be used in the statement [MESSAGE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmessage.htm). The four attributes ATTR1 to ATTR4 stand for the content of four placeholders. The constructor provides input parameters for all necessary values. In the constructor, the message class and the message number are written directly to the associated components of the interface structure T100KEY. The identically named attributes are assigned to the components ATTR1 to ATTR4 and filled with the passed values.

Once the class is instantiated, the message text is filled using the interface method GET\_TEXT, which is implemented in an appropriate way in the class and which has an alias name declared. The object of the class is used directly as an operand of the statement [MESSAGE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmessage.htm). A message type must be specified here.

Description

The functional method meth raises an exception from the local exception class cx\_t100 that implements the interface [IF\_T100\_MESSAGE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenif_t100_message.htm). When the exception is raised, the constructor is given a message class, a message number, and values for the placeholders of the message.

The constructor of the local exception class cx\_t100 fills the attribute T100KEY of the interface IF\_T100\_MESSAGE with the values passed. In this way, the exception class represents the passed message from the table T100 in which the placeholders "&" are replaced with the content of the attributes text1 to text4.

The method main catches the exception in the reference variable oref and indicates the following:

-   The exception text can be filled using the method GET\_TEXT of the component interface IF\_MESSAGE in the interface IF\_T100\_MESSAGE. The implementation of the method GET\_TEXT is in the superclass CX\_ROOT, which implements the interface IF\_MESSAGE.

-   The reference variable can be used directly as an operand of the statement [MESSAGE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmessage.htm).

Description

This executable example works in the same way as the example in [System Interface IF\_T100\_MESSAGE in a Local Exception Class](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenmessage_interface_abexa.htm). Here, however, the interface IF\_T100\_MESSAGE is included in the global [exception class](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenexception_class_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") CX\_DEMO\_T100. The association with a message class was made at the same time as the class was created. This specifies that the exception class is generated in such a way that it supports messages as [exception texts](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenexception_texts.htm), rather than merely including the interface IF\_T100\_MESSAGE.

On the tab Texts in [Class Builder](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenclass_builder_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), the message 888 from the message class SABAPDEMOS is assigned to the exception text DEMO of the exception class under Message Text. The placeholders of the message are associated with the attributes TEXT1 to TEXT4. The source text of the public section of the class implements this assignment using the structured constant DEMO with the type SCX\_T100KEY. The constructor has an input parameter TEXTID that can be passed the constant DEMO and the input parameters TEXT1 to TEXT4 used to fill the attributes with the same names.

A structure passed to the input parameter TEXTID when an exception from this class is raised is assigned to the structure T100KEY of the interface IF\_T100\_MESSAGE. This uses the corresponding message as an exception text. It is recommended that only the predefined constants of the class are passed, as shown here.

Description

This example demonstrates the transformation of a non-class-based exception raised in a method using [MESSAGE RAISING](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmessage_raising.htm) and, when the method is called, handled using the addition [EXCEPTIONS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall_method_parameters.htm) to a class-based exception. It uses the exception CX\_DEMO\_T100 from the [executable example](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenmessage_interface_global_abexa.htm) for the system interface IF\_T100\_MESSAGE in a global exception class, which implements only the interface [IF\_T100\_MESSAGE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenif_t100_message.htm) and not [IF\_T100\_DYN\_MSG](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenif_t100_message.htm).

The properties of the message sent using MESSAGE RAISING are available in the system fields sy-msgty, sy-msgid, sy-msgno, and sy-msgv1 to sy-msgv4 after the exception is caught.

-   sy-msgid and sy-msgno are used after the addition [MESSAGE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapraise_exception_message.htm) of the statement [RAISE EXCEPTION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapraise_exception_class.htm) to associate the exception object with the message.

-   sy-msgv1 to sy-msgv4 are assigned to the input parameters of the instance constructor, which themselves are assigned to the identically named attributes.

-   sy-msgty cannot be passed further in this case.

The [executable example](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenraise_message_global_abexa.htm) for the system interface IF\_T100\_DYN\_MSG in a global exception demonstrates how all properties of the message can be specified after the addition [MESSAGE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapraise_exception_message.htm).

Messages - System Interface IF\_T100\_MESSAGE

The interface IF\_T100\_MESSAGE links classes with [messages](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenmessage_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). Classes that implement that interface can be used to access and send messages. For that purpose, IF\_T100\_MESSAGE contains a structured attribute T100KEY of the type SCX\_T100KEY. In a class that implements the interface, the contents of this structure specify a [message](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenmessage_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in the database table T100:

-   The contents of component MSGID specifies the [message class](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenmessage_class_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

-   The contents of component MSGNO specifies the [message number](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenmessage_number_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

-   The contents of components ATTR1 to ATTR4 specify names of attributes of the implementing class whose content is used as placeholder texts for the possible placeholders in the texts of the message.

Using an implementing class, the message text can be accessed as follows:

-   The interface IF\_T100\_MESSAGE includes the interface IF\_MESSAGE, which should not be used as a standalone interface. This interface contains the methods GET\_TEXT and GET\_LONGTEXT, which can be implemented by a class with the interface IF\_T100\_MESSAGE in such a way that they return the short text and long text of the current message. For that the corresponding methods of the class CL\_MESSAGE\_HELPER can be used.

-   In the variant [MESSAGE oref](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmessage_msg.htm) of the statement [MESSAGE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmessage.htm), an [interface reference variable](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeninterface_ref_variable_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the type IF\_T100\_MESSAGE or a [class reference variable](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenclass_reference_variabl_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of a class that implements this interface can be specified to send the message that is specified by the contents of the structure T100KEY.

For that, the statement MESSAGE or the class CL\_MESSAGE\_HELPER evaluates the content of the structure T100KEY as follows:

-   In database table T100, a message is searched whose message class and message number correspond to the The components MSGID and MSGNO of the structure T100KEY. If a message is found, its texts are used. If not, a short text is generated that lists the message class and message number as well as the placeholder texts from the class attributes that are specified in the structure.

-   The possible placeholders "&1" to "&4" and "&" of the short text or "&V1&" to "&V4&" of the long text of the message are replaced by the content of the class attributes specified in the components ATTR1 to ATTR4 of structure T100KEY in accordance with the rules of the addition [WITH](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmessage.htm) of the statement [MESSAGE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmessage.htm). If an attribute specified in the components ATTR1 to ATTR4 does not exist or if the contents of an attribute cannot be converted to a placeholder text, the character "&" is added to the start and the end of the attribute name and the resulting string is used as the placeholder text. If one of the components ATTR1 to ATTR4 is initial, the corresponding placeholder text is initialized.

Hints

-   The interface IF\_T100\_MESSAGE is mainly designed for use with [exception texts](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenexception_texts.htm) in [exception classes](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenexception_class_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). If the interface is implemented in regular classes and in local exception classes, the filling of the interface structure T100KEY must be programmed here explicitly. For global exception classes, however, the implementation of the interface methods GET\_TEXT and GET\_LONGTEXT is already contained in the superclass CX\_ROOT and alias names are declared for these methods there. When creating global exception classes, tool support is provided for filling the structure T100KEY and for mapping attributes to placeholders. This is done using structured constants that can be specified when an exception is raised.

-   Be aware, that with interface IF\_T100\_MESSAGE there is a double indirection for the possible placeholders of a message. The text for a placeholder is taken from an attribute of the implementing class whose name is itself contained in a component of structure T100KEY.

-   The method GET\_LATEST\_T100\_EXCEPTION in the class CL\_MESSAGE\_HELPER can be used to return the last object in a chain of exception objects (linked by the attribute PREVIOUS) that has an [exception text](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenexception_texts.htm) defined by a message.

-   The interface IF\_T100\_MESSAGE does not have any attributes for the message type.

-   The interface [IF\_T100\_DYN\_MSG](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenif_t100_dyn_msg.htm) adds predefined attributes for the message type and the placeholders of the message to the interface IF\_T100\_MESSAGE. While IF\_T100\_MESSAGE is designed for static [exception texts](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenexception_texts.htm) of exception classes, IF\_T100\_DYN\_MSG can [bind](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenmessage_exceptions.htm) any messages to exception classes.

Example

Raising an exception of the class CX\_DEMO\_T100, which implements the interface IF\_T100\_MESSAGE by using [THROW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconditional_expression_result.htm).

Messages - System Interface IF\_T100\_DYN\_MSG

The interface IF\_T100\_DYN\_MSG includes the interface [IF\_T100\_MESSAGE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenif_t100_message.htm) as a component interface and adds the following to it:

-   The attribute MSGTY for the message type

-   The attributes MSGV1 to MSGV4 for the placeholders of the message

Like IF\_T100\_MESSAGE, the interface IF\_T100\_DYN\_MSG associates classes with messages, with the attributes for the message type and placeholders of the message being predefined.

Hints

-   The interface IF\_T100\_DYN\_MSG is designed specifically for raising class-based exceptions with the addition [MESSAGE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapraise_exception_message.htm) of the statement [RAISE EXCEPTION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapraise_exception_class.htm) or the addition [THROW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconditional_expression_result.htm) in [conditional expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconditional_expressions.htm). The properties of the message specified after MESSAGE are assigned automatically to the associated attributes in [exception classes](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenexceptions_classes.htm) that include IF\_T100\_DYN\_MSG.

-   The addition [MESSAGE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapraise_exception_message.htm) to RAISE EXCEPTION and/or THROW has a short form USING MESSAGE. This can be used for exception classes with the interface IF\_T100\_DYN\_MSG and enables determining the message from the current content of system fields sy-msg.... The short form can be used for transforming classical exceptions in class-based exceptions.

-   If the object reference variable oref points to an object that implements the system interface IF\_T100\_DYN\_MSG in the variant [MESSAGE oref](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmessage_msg.htm) of the statement [MESSAGE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmessage.htm), the addition TYPE can be omitted and the message type from the interface attribute MSGTY of the object is used implicitly.

Example

Uses [THROW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconditional_expression_result.htm) to raise an exception of the class CX\_DEMO\_DYN\_T100, which implements the interface IF\_T100\_DYN\_MSG.

Description

This example applies the [executable example](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenif_t100_message_abexa.htm) for the interface IF\_T100\_MESSAGE to the interface IF\_T100\_DYN\_MSG directly. If IF\_T100\_DYN\_MSG is used, it is no longer necessary to create separate attributes for the placeholders of the message. The attributes of the interface are used instead. Furthermore, a message type can be saved and evaluated in the interface attribute msgty. If IF\_T100\_MESSAGE is used, a separate attribute must be declared here.

Description

This example transfers the [executable example](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenmessage_interface_abexa.htm) for the interface IF\_T100\_MESSAGE directly to the interface IF\_T100\_DYN\_MSG. The local class cx\_dyn\_t100 implements the interface [IF\_T100\_DYN\_MSG](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenif_t100_dyn_msg.htm) and the addition [MESSAGE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapraise_exception_message.htm) of the statement [RAISE EXCEPTION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapraise_exception_class.htm) is used to raise the exception in the method meth.

Unlike when using [IF\_T100\_MESSAGE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenif_t100_message.htm), no separate attributes for the placeholders of the message and no implementation of the instance constructor are required in cx\_dyn\_t100. Furthermore, the message type is passed in an attribute of the exception object when IF\_T100\_DYN\_MSG is used. An alias name is used here.

Description

This example demonstrates the transformation of a non-class-based exception raised in a method using [MESSAGE RAISING](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmessage_raising.htm) and, when the method is called, handled using the addition [EXCEPTIONS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall_method_parameters.htm) to a class-based exception. This example works in the same way as the [executable example](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenmessage_interface_reuse_abexa.htm) for the system interface [IF\_T100\_MESSAGE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenif_t100_message.htm), but uses the class CX\_DEMO\_DYN\_T100, which implements the system interface [IF\_T100\_DYN\_MSG](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenif_t100_dyn_msg.htm).

-   In both cases, sy-msgid and sy-msgno can be used after the addition [MESSAGE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapraise_exception_message.htm) of the statement [RAISE EXCEPTION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapraise_exception_class.htm) to associate the exception object with the message.

-   sy-msgv1 to sy-msgv4 can be specified after [WITH](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapraise_exception_message.htm) and are assigned here to the interface attributes MSGV1 to MSGV4 automatically.

-   sy-msgty can also be passed further here using [MESSAGE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapraise_exception_message.htm).

Hint

See also the executable [example](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenraise_message_glbl_shrt_abexa.htm) for using a short form of statement [RAISE EXCEPTION MESSAGE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapraise_exception_message.htm).

Description

This example works in basically the same way as the [executable example](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenraise_message_global_abexa.htm) when transforming a classic exception raised using MESSAGE RAISING to a class-based exception. Here, however, a message of type A caught using [error\_message](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall_function_parameter.htm) is transformed.

[ABAP - Keyword Documentation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap.htm)¬†‚Üí¬† [ABAP - Programming Language](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_reference.htm)¬†‚Üí¬† [Text Repositories](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_texts.htm)¬†‚Üí¬† [Messages](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_messages.htm)¬†‚Üí¬† [Messages - System Interfaces](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenmessage_interfaces.htm)¬†‚Üí¬†

Messages - System Interface IF\_T100\_DYN\_MSG

The interface IF\_T100\_DYN\_MSG includes the interface [IF\_T100\_MESSAGE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenif_t100_message.htm) as a component interface and adds the following to it:

-   The attribute MSGTY for the message type

-   The attributes MSGV1 to MSGV4 for the placeholders of the message

Like IF\_T100\_MESSAGE, the interface IF\_T100\_DYN\_MSG associates classes with messages, with the attributes for the message type and placeholders of the message being predefined.

Hints

-   The interface IF\_T100\_DYN\_MSG is designed specifically for raising class-based exceptions with the addition [MESSAGE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapraise_exception_message.htm) of the statement [RAISE EXCEPTION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapraise_exception_class.htm) or the addition [THROW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconditional_expression_result.htm) in [conditional expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconditional_expressions.htm). The properties of the message specified after MESSAGE are assigned automatically to the associated attributes in [exception classes](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenexceptions_classes.htm) that include IF\_T100\_DYN\_MSG.

-   The addition [MESSAGE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapraise_exception_message.htm) to RAISE EXCEPTION and/or THROW has a short form USING MESSAGE. This can be used for exception classes with the interface IF\_T100\_DYN\_MSG and enables determining the message from the current content of system fields sy-msg.... The short form can be used for transforming classical exceptions in class-based exceptions.

-   If the object reference variable oref points to an object that implements the system interface IF\_T100\_DYN\_MSG in the variant [MESSAGE oref](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmessage_msg.htm) of the statement [MESSAGE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmessage.htm), the addition TYPE can be omitted and the message type from the interface attribute MSGTY of the object is used implicitly.

Example

Uses [THROW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconditional_expression_result.htm) to raise an exception of the class CX\_DEMO\_DYN\_T100, which implements the interface IF\_T100\_DYN\_MSG.

Description

The function module DEMO\_RFM\_PARAMETERS is called using [synchronous](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall_function_destination.htm) and [asynchronous](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall_function_starting.htm) RFC.

-   In synchronous calls, parameters are passed and applied directly in the statement CALL FUNCTION.

-   In asynchronous calls, parameters can only be passed in the statement CALL FUNCTION. Parameters are applied using the statement [RECEIVE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapreceive.htm) in a callback routine. The statement [WAIT FOR ASYNCHRONOUS TASKS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapwait_arfc.htm) is used to wait for this routine.

Description

Parallel asynchronous processing of the function module RFC\_SYSTEM\_INFO using [asynchronous remote function calls](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenasynchronous_rfc_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). Ten calls with different task IDs name are made, which each run in a separate [work process](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenwork_process_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The callback routine callbback\_meth counts the completed function modules and receives information about the target system.

The addition GROUP DEFAULT is used to distribute the execution across all [AS instances](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenapplication_server_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS ABAP. If no more free work processes are available after at least one successful call, the execution of the program is stopped until all function modules started up to that point have been completed. This stoppage is limited to a maximum of 5 seconds.

After all function modules have been started, the system waits until all callback routines have been executed. After that, the internal table task\_list filled there is produced. The output shows the order in which the individual tasks were completed and on which AS instance.

Description

The method CREATE\_RFC\_DESTINATION of class CL\_DYNAMIC\_DESTINATION is used to create a [dynamic destination](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrfc_destination.htm). Input values, whose default values are determined from system fields for the current AS ABAP, are passed as parameters. A remote-enabled function module is called using the dynamic destination. The call is only successful if the destination is created correctly.

Description

A remote-enabled function module DEMO\_RFM\_LOGON\_DATA is called with the destination "NONE" using the RFC interface. The logon data user name, client, and logon language of the corresponding [RFC session](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrfc_context.htm) are provided implicitly. To demonstrate that the [logon language](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenlogon_language_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the RFC session is set by the language of the [text environment](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abentext_environment_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the caller, this is set before the call with the statement [SET LOCALE LANGUAGE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapset_locale.htm) to a language different from the logon language of the caller. In the called RFM the language of the text environment of the RFC session is also changed and is then different to the logon language there as well.

If the function module DEMO\_RFM\_LOGON\_DATA is called remotely again, the RFC session is reused with the existing logon data. Changing the language of the text environment again in the caller would have no effect.

Description

The function module DEMO\_RFM\_PARAMETERS is called using [synchronous](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall_function_destination.htm) and [asynchronous](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall_function_starting.htm) RFC.

-   In synchronous calls, parameters are passed and applied directly in the statement CALL FUNCTION.

-   In asynchronous calls, parameters can only be passed in the statement CALL FUNCTION. Parameters are applied using the statement [RECEIVE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapreceive.htm) in a callback routine. The statement [WAIT FOR ASYNCHRONOUS TASKS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapwait_arfc.htm) is used to wait for this routine.

Description

Parallel asynchronous processing of the function module RFC\_SYSTEM\_INFO using [asynchronous remote function calls](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenasynchronous_rfc_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). Ten calls with different task IDs name are made, which each run in a separate [work process](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenwork_process_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The callback routine callbback\_meth counts the completed function modules and receives information about the target system.

The addition GROUP DEFAULT is used to distribute the execution across all [AS instances](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenapplication_server_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS ABAP. If no more free work processes are available after at least one successful call, the execution of the program is stopped until all function modules started up to that point have been completed. This stoppage is limited to a maximum of 5 seconds.

After all function modules have been started, the system waits until all callback routines have been executed. After that, the internal table task\_list filled there is produced. The output shows the order in which the individual tasks were completed and on which AS instance.

Description

The method CREATE\_RFC\_DESTINATION of class CL\_DYNAMIC\_DESTINATION is used to create a [dynamic destination](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrfc_destination.htm). Input values, whose default values are determined from system fields for the current AS ABAP, are passed as parameters. A remote-enabled function module is called using the dynamic destination. The call is only successful if the destination is created correctly.

Description

A remote-enabled function module DEMO\_RFM\_LOGON\_DATA is called with the destination "NONE" using the RFC interface. The logon data user name, client, and logon language of the corresponding [RFC session](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrfc_context.htm) are provided implicitly. To demonstrate that the [logon language](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenlogon_language_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the RFC session is set by the language of the [text environment](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abentext_environment_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the caller, this is set before the call with the statement [SET LOCALE LANGUAGE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapset_locale.htm) to a language different from the logon language of the caller. In the called RFM the language of the text environment of the RFC session is also changed and is then different to the logon language there as well.

If the function module DEMO\_RFM\_LOGON\_DATA is called remotely again, the RFC session is reused with the existing logon data. Changing the language of the text environment again in the caller would have no effect.

Description

The function module DEMO\_RFM\_PARAMETERS is called using [synchronous](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall_function_destination.htm) and [asynchronous](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall_function_starting.htm) RFC.

-   In synchronous calls, parameters are passed and applied directly in the statement CALL FUNCTION.

-   In asynchronous calls, parameters can only be passed in the statement CALL FUNCTION. Parameters are applied using the statement [RECEIVE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapreceive.htm) in a callback routine. The statement [WAIT FOR ASYNCHRONOUS TASKS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapwait_arfc.htm) is used to wait for this routine.

Description

The DEMO\_RFM\_CLASSIC\_EXCEPTION function module raises the non-class-based exception CLASSIC\_EXCEPTION.

When DEMO\_RFM\_CLASSIC\_EXCEPTION is called, EXCEPTIONS is specified and values for sy-subrc are assigned to the possible classic exceptions. If none of the predefined RFC interface exceptions are raised, sy-subrc is set to 3.

Description

Parallel asynchronous processing of the function module RFC\_SYSTEM\_INFO using [asynchronous remote function calls](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenasynchronous_rfc_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). Ten calls with different task IDs name are made, which each run in a separate [work process](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenwork_process_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The callback routine callbback\_meth counts the completed function modules and receives information about the target system.

The addition GROUP DEFAULT is used to distribute the execution across all [AS instances](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenapplication_server_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS ABAP. If no more free work processes are available after at least one successful call, the execution of the program is stopped until all function modules started up to that point have been completed. This stoppage is limited to a maximum of 5 seconds.

After all function modules have been started, the system waits until all callback routines have been executed. After that, the internal table task\_list filled there is produced. The output shows the order in which the individual tasks were completed and on which AS instance.

Description

The method CREATE\_RFC\_DESTINATION of class CL\_DYNAMIC\_DESTINATION is used to create a [dynamic destination](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrfc_destination.htm). Input values, whose default values are determined from system fields for the current AS ABAP, are passed as parameters. A remote-enabled function module is called using the dynamic destination. The call is only successful if the destination is created correctly.

Description

A remote-enabled function module DEMO\_RFM\_LOGON\_DATA is called with the destination "NONE" using the RFC interface. The logon data user name, client, and logon language of the corresponding [RFC session](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrfc_context.htm) are provided implicitly. To demonstrate that the [logon language](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenlogon_language_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the RFC session is set by the language of the [text environment](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abentext_environment_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the caller, this is set before the call with the statement [SET LOCALE LANGUAGE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapset_locale.htm) to a language different from the logon language of the caller. In the called RFM the language of the text environment of the RFC session is also changed and is then different to the logon language there as well.

If the function module DEMO\_RFM\_LOGON\_DATA is called remotely again, the RFC session is reused with the existing logon data. Changing the language of the text environment again in the caller would have no effect.

Description

The function module DEMO\_RFM\_PARAMETERS is called using [synchronous](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall_function_destination.htm) and [asynchronous](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall_function_starting.htm) RFC.

-   In synchronous calls, parameters are passed and applied directly in the statement CALL FUNCTION.

-   In asynchronous calls, parameters can only be passed in the statement CALL FUNCTION. Parameters are applied using the statement [RECEIVE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapreceive.htm) in a callback routine. The statement [WAIT FOR ASYNCHRONOUS TASKS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapwait_arfc.htm) is used to wait for this routine.

Description

Parallel asynchronous processing of the function module RFC\_SYSTEM\_INFO using [asynchronous remote function calls](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenasynchronous_rfc_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). Ten calls with different task IDs name are made, which each run in a separate [work process](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenwork_process_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The callback routine callbback\_meth counts the completed function modules and receives information about the target system.

The addition GROUP DEFAULT is used to distribute the execution across all [AS instances](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenapplication_server_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS ABAP. If no more free work processes are available after at least one successful call, the execution of the program is stopped until all function modules started up to that point have been completed. This stoppage is limited to a maximum of 5 seconds.

After all function modules have been started, the system waits until all callback routines have been executed. After that, the internal table task\_list filled there is produced. The output shows the order in which the individual tasks were completed and on which AS instance.

Description

The method CREATE\_RFC\_DESTINATION of class CL\_DYNAMIC\_DESTINATION is used to create a [dynamic destination](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrfc_destination.htm). Input values, whose default values are determined from system fields for the current AS ABAP, are passed as parameters. A remote-enabled function module is called using the dynamic destination. The call is only successful if the destination is created correctly.

Description

A remote-enabled function module DEMO\_RFM\_LOGON\_DATA is called with the destination "NONE" using the RFC interface. The logon data user name, client, and logon language of the corresponding [RFC session](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrfc_context.htm) are provided implicitly. To demonstrate that the [logon language](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenlogon_language_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the RFC session is set by the language of the [text environment](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abentext_environment_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the caller, this is set before the call with the statement [SET LOCALE LANGUAGE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapset_locale.htm) to a language different from the logon language of the caller. In the called RFM the language of the text environment of the RFC session is also changed and is then different to the logon language there as well.

If the function module DEMO\_RFM\_LOGON\_DATA is called remotely again, the RFC session is reused with the existing logon data. Changing the language of the text environment again in the caller would have no effect.

Description

The function module DEMO\_RFM\_PARAMETERS is called using [synchronous](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall_function_destination.htm) and [asynchronous](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall_function_starting.htm) RFC.

-   In synchronous calls, parameters are passed and applied directly in the statement CALL FUNCTION.

-   In asynchronous calls, parameters can only be passed in the statement CALL FUNCTION. Parameters are applied using the statement [RECEIVE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapreceive.htm) in a callback routine. The statement [WAIT FOR ASYNCHRONOUS TASKS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapwait_arfc.htm) is used to wait for this routine.

Description

Parallel asynchronous processing of the function module RFC\_SYSTEM\_INFO using [asynchronous remote function calls](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenasynchronous_rfc_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). Ten calls with different task IDs name are made, which each run in a separate [work process](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenwork_process_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The callback routine callbback\_meth counts the completed function modules and receives information about the target system.

The addition GROUP DEFAULT is used to distribute the execution across all [AS instances](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenapplication_server_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS ABAP. If no more free work processes are available after at least one successful call, the execution of the program is stopped until all function modules started up to that point have been completed. This stoppage is limited to a maximum of 5 seconds.

After all function modules have been started, the system waits until all callback routines have been executed. After that, the internal table task\_list filled there is produced. The output shows the order in which the individual tasks were completed and on which AS instance.

Description

The method CREATE\_RFC\_DESTINATION of class CL\_DYNAMIC\_DESTINATION is used to create a [dynamic destination](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrfc_destination.htm). Input values, whose default values are determined from system fields for the current AS ABAP, are passed as parameters. A remote-enabled function module is called using the dynamic destination. The call is only successful if the destination is created correctly.

Description

A remote-enabled function module DEMO\_RFM\_LOGON\_DATA is called with the destination "NONE" using the RFC interface. The logon data user name, client, and logon language of the corresponding [RFC session](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrfc_context.htm) are provided implicitly. To demonstrate that the [logon language](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenlogon_language_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the RFC session is set by the language of the [text environment](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abentext_environment_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the caller, this is set before the call with the statement [SET LOCALE LANGUAGE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapset_locale.htm) to a language different from the logon language of the caller. In the called RFM the language of the text environment of the RFC session is also changed and is then different to the logon language there as well.

If the function module DEMO\_RFM\_LOGON\_DATA is called remotely again, the RFC session is reused with the existing logon data. Changing the language of the text environment again in the caller would have no effect.

ICF - Internet Communication Framework

Internet Communication Framework (ICF) is a programming interface (API), based on interfaces and classes, used by ABAP programs to communicate with the Internet. ICF supports the Internet protocols HTTP, HTTPS, and SMTP. All communication between ABAP and the Internet based on these protocols takes place using ICF. ICF is a simplified technical foundation that can be used by more advanced programming interfaces. This means that ABAP programs do not usually access ICF directly and wrappers are accessed instead, such as [Business Server Pages](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbusiness_server_pages_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), [Web Dynpro ABAP](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenweb_dynpro_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), or the OData-based [ABAP RAP](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_rap_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). Wrappers like these make sure that the conventions required by external communication are met, such as the Model View Controller (MVC) approach in Web Dynpro or stateless AS ABAP in [ABAP RAP](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_rap_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

The built-in function [escape](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenescape_functions.htm) and the method ESCAPE\_QUOTES of the class CL\_ABAP\_DYN\_PRG are using to prevent [cross site scripting](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenxss_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and [SQL injections](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abensql_injection_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The content of the internal table connections (filled in accordance with the passed form field) is converted to HTML using the class CL\_DEMO\_OUTPUT before it is passed to the RESPONSE object.

Hint

The HTTP service must be activated in transaction SICF before the example can work.

Description

This example has the same structure as the executable example [Calling an HTTP Service](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenicf_service_abexa.htm). In this case, the method IF\_HTTP\_EXTENSION~HANDLE\_REQUEST of the class CL\_HTTP\_EXT\_SERVICE\_POST\_DEMO is used to demonstrate how user input sent by a HTML page form generated by the handler class is sent using the POST method and read using the method GET\_CDATA.

Hint

The HTTP service must be activated in transaction SICF before the example can work.

Description

The factory method CREATE of the class CL\_HTTP\_CLIENT is used to create a client object for the address wikipedia.org. The reference variable client of the type IF\_HTTP\_CLIENT points to this object. A specific request, which also contains the value of a user input, is added to the URI of the REQUEST object of the client object. The request is sent and the result is passed to the RESPONSE object of the client object. In the case in question, the HTML page produced by the requested is retrieved and displayed.

Hint

The proxy setting for the HTTP client must be configured correctly in transaction SICF before this example can work.

Description

If a path to a HTTP service from ICF is constructed in the same way in transaction SICF as the path to a MIME repository node and the handler class CL\_HTTP\_EXT\_WEBDAV\_PUBLIC is assigned to the service, the service can be used to access the MIME objects of this node directly.

The example contains the node /sap/public/bc/abap/mime\_demo in both the transaction SICF and in the MIME repository. The image ABAP\_Docu\_Logo.gif is saved in the MIME repository under this node. The handler class CL\_HTTP\_EXT\_WEBDAV\_PUBLIC is assigned to the ICF node. The name of the image can be added to the URL of the service and used to access the image directly.

See also the [executable example](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenmime_pictures_abexa.htm) for accessing objects from the MIME repository using the associated API.

Description

The HTTP service /sap/bc/abap/demo\_mime can be called with different contents of the form field mime\_access of the URL:

-   If the form field has the value icf, the handler class CL\_HTTP\_EXT\_MIME\_DEMO creates an HTML file. This file points to an image in the MIME repository (as described in a different executable [example](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenicf_mime_pictures_abexa.htm)).

-   If the form field has the value api, the handler class CL\_HTTP\_EXT\_MIME\_DEMO creates the HTML file and also the image that is referenced in the HTML file. The image is loaded and forwarded using MIME API.

ABAP and Operating System Statements

Operating system statements or system commands execute statements or programs directly on the operating system of the host computer of an AS instance or of a presentation server. Executing operating system statements from ABAP programs should be the exception not the rule, however it may become necessary in system or administration programs to call operating system functions that cannot be accessed by ABAP statements. In certain circumstances, input from external sources may need to be passed to the operating system.

-   [Operating System Statements of the Host Computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl.htm)

-   [Operating System Statements of the Presentation Server](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_pres.htm)

Security Hint

Using input from external sources in operating system statements incurs the risk of [system command injections](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abensys_comm_injections_scrty.htm).

SXPG Framework for Operating System Statements

The only recommended method for executing operating system statements from ABAP on the operating system of the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance or another server is to use the SXPG framework. This framework is based on a list of allowed operating system statements that can be called using function modules in the function pool SXPG.

The list of allowed operating system statements is defined by the system administrator in transaction SM69. Here, the platform-dependent physical operating system statements are assigned to a logical command name used to address them in ABAP. When one of these logical command names is passed to one of the function modules listed below, the operating system statement appropriate for the platform in question is executed. Logical command names assigned to an operating system command used by all platforms can be flagged with the operating system ANYOS. Static parameters can be assigned to any operating system statement and further parameters can be specified for when the statement is called. When an operating system statement is called using a logical command name, implicit authorization checks are performed, accompanied by extra self-defined checks. SAP provides a range of predefined logical command names with the type SAP. Logical command names created by customers have the type KUNDE.

If they have the right authorizations, developers can view the list of operating system statements in transaction SM49 and execute them from here. The following function modules can be called from ABAP programs:

-   SXPG\_CALL\_SYSTEM for execution on the host computer of the current AS instance

-   SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE for execution on other servers; the result can caught, but this is not mandatory

-   SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE\_LONG, like SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE but with a longer list of parameters

These function modules can also be called remotely.

Hint

For more information, see the Documentation Programming with External Commands in SAP Help Portal.

Example

Calls the operating system statement ping for the central database server of the system on the host computer of the current AS instance using the logical command name PING defined by SAP. The result of the call is passed to the internal table result. The function module SXPG\_CALL\_SYSTEM can raise more specific exceptions than those handled explicitly here.

Unwanted Calls of Operating System Statements

Alongside calls of function modules in the [SXPG framework](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm), operating system statements for the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance can be executed in ABAP programs as follows:

-   The addition [FILTER](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_os_addition.htm) of the statement [OPEN DATASET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset.htm) used for executing operating system statements using pipes.

-   The internal statement [CALL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall-.htm) used to call a special system function (SYSTEM), which can be used to execute operating system statements.

Neither of these options should be used for common execution of operating system statements in ABAP programs.

-   The addition [FILTER](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_os_addition.htm) of [OPEN DATASET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset.htm) should only be used (if at all) for operating system statements required for data handling.

-   Calls of the system function SYSTEM with the internal statement [CALL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall-.htm) should never be made and can be deactivated using the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") rdisp/call\_system. If called, it then raises an uncatchable exception.

Both statements cause the following problems:

-   There are no central authorization checks.

-   The platform dependency of the operating system statements must be handled in the ABAP program itself.

-   Errors and exceptions cannot be handled specifically.

-   If input from external sources is used, it must be checked thoroughly and filtered to prevent [system command injections](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abensys_comm_injections_scrty.htm) on any platform.

If possible, the [SXPG framework](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm) should be used instead of these two options.

Hint

Before the statements CALL 'SYSTEM' is deactivated using the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") rdisp/call\_system, it must be ensured that it is no longer used in any programs. Any programs that still use CALL 'SYSTEM' must first be switched to use of the [SXPG frameworks](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm) before the unwanted statement can be deactivated. The options in the SXPG frameworks generally cover all requirements when calling operating system statements.

Example

Calls the operating system statement ping for the central database server of the system on the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance using the addition FILTER of the statement OPEN DATASET. The output of the operating system statement is written to the opened file and can be read from there.

ABAP and Operating System Statements

Operating system statements or system commands execute statements or programs directly on the operating system of the host computer of an AS instance or of a presentation server. Executing operating system statements from ABAP programs should be the exception not the rule, however it may become necessary in system or administration programs to call operating system functions that cannot be accessed by ABAP statements. In certain circumstances, input from external sources may need to be passed to the operating system.

-   [Operating System Statements of the Host Computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl.htm)

-   [Operating System Statements of the Presentation Server](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_pres.htm)

Security Hint

Using input from external sources in operating system statements incurs the risk of [system command injections](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abensys_comm_injections_scrty.htm).

SXPG Framework for Operating System Statements

The only recommended method for executing operating system statements from ABAP on the operating system of the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance or another server is to use the SXPG framework. This framework is based on a list of allowed operating system statements that can be called using function modules in the function pool SXPG.

The list of allowed operating system statements is defined by the system administrator in transaction SM69. Here, the platform-dependent physical operating system statements are assigned to a logical command name used to address them in ABAP. When one of these logical command names is passed to one of the function modules listed below, the operating system statement appropriate for the platform in question is executed. Logical command names assigned to an operating system command used by all platforms can be flagged with the operating system ANYOS. Static parameters can be assigned to any operating system statement and further parameters can be specified for when the statement is called. When an operating system statement is called using a logical command name, implicit authorization checks are performed, accompanied by extra self-defined checks. SAP provides a range of predefined logical command names with the type SAP. Logical command names created by customers have the type KUNDE.

If they have the right authorizations, developers can view the list of operating system statements in transaction SM49 and execute them from here. The following function modules can be called from ABAP programs:

-   SXPG\_CALL\_SYSTEM for execution on the host computer of the current AS instance

-   SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE for execution on other servers; the result can caught, but this is not mandatory

-   SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE\_LONG, like SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE but with a longer list of parameters

These function modules can also be called remotely.

Hint

For more information, see the Documentation Programming with External Commands in SAP Help Portal.

Example

Calls the operating system statement ping for the central database server of the system on the host computer of the current AS instance using the logical command name PING defined by SAP. The result of the call is passed to the internal table result. The function module SXPG\_CALL\_SYSTEM can raise more specific exceptions than those handled explicitly here.

Unwanted Calls of Operating System Statements

Alongside calls of function modules in the [SXPG framework](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm), operating system statements for the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance can be executed in ABAP programs as follows:

-   The addition [FILTER](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_os_addition.htm) of the statement [OPEN DATASET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset.htm) used for executing operating system statements using pipes.

-   The internal statement [CALL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall-.htm) used to call a special system function (SYSTEM), which can be used to execute operating system statements.

Neither of these options should be used for common execution of operating system statements in ABAP programs.

-   The addition [FILTER](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_os_addition.htm) of [OPEN DATASET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset.htm) should only be used (if at all) for operating system statements required for data handling.

-   Calls of the system function SYSTEM with the internal statement [CALL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall-.htm) should never be made and can be deactivated using the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") rdisp/call\_system. If called, it then raises an uncatchable exception.

Both statements cause the following problems:

-   There are no central authorization checks.

-   The platform dependency of the operating system statements must be handled in the ABAP program itself.

-   Errors and exceptions cannot be handled specifically.

-   If input from external sources is used, it must be checked thoroughly and filtered to prevent [system command injections](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abensys_comm_injections_scrty.htm) on any platform.

If possible, the [SXPG framework](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm) should be used instead of these two options.

Hint

Before the statements CALL 'SYSTEM' is deactivated using the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") rdisp/call\_system, it must be ensured that it is no longer used in any programs. Any programs that still use CALL 'SYSTEM' must first be switched to use of the [SXPG frameworks](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm) before the unwanted statement can be deactivated. The options in the SXPG frameworks generally cover all requirements when calling operating system statements.

Example

Calls the operating system statement ping for the central database server of the system on the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance using the addition FILTER of the statement OPEN DATASET. The output of the operating system statement is written to the opened file and can be read from there.

DATA dbserver TYPE c LENGTH 255.
CALL 'C\_SAPGPARAM' ID 'NAME'¬†¬†FIELD 'SAPDBHOST'
¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ID 'VALUE' FIELD¬†¬†dbserver.

The result of the call is passed to the internal table result. This example can only be executed if the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") rdisp/call\_system allows the call.

ABAP and Operating System Statements

Operating system statements or system commands execute statements or programs directly on the operating system of the host computer of an AS instance or of a presentation server. Executing operating system statements from ABAP programs should be the exception not the rule, however it may become necessary in system or administration programs to call operating system functions that cannot be accessed by ABAP statements. In certain circumstances, input from external sources may need to be passed to the operating system.

-   [Operating System Statements of the Presentation Server](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_pres.htm)

Security Hint

Using input from external sources in operating system statements incurs the risk of [system command injections](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abensys_comm_injections_scrty.htm).

SXPG Framework for Operating System Statements

The only recommended method for executing operating system statements from ABAP on the operating system of the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance or another server is to use the SXPG framework. This framework is based on a list of allowed operating system statements that can be called using function modules in the function pool SXPG.

The list of allowed operating system statements is defined by the system administrator in transaction SM69. Here, the platform-dependent physical operating system statements are assigned to a logical command name used to address them in ABAP. When one of these logical command names is passed to one of the function modules listed below, the operating system statement appropriate for the platform in question is executed. Logical command names assigned to an operating system command used by all platforms can be flagged with the operating system ANYOS. Static parameters can be assigned to any operating system statement and further parameters can be specified for when the statement is called. When an operating system statement is called using a logical command name, implicit authorization checks are performed, accompanied by extra self-defined checks. SAP provides a range of predefined logical command names with the type SAP. Logical command names created by customers have the type KUNDE.

If they have the right authorizations, developers can view the list of operating system statements in transaction SM49 and execute them from here. The following function modules can be called from ABAP programs:

-   SXPG\_CALL\_SYSTEM for execution on the host computer of the current AS instance

-   SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE for execution on other servers; the result can caught, but this is not mandatory

-   SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE\_LONG, like SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE but with a longer list of parameters

These function modules can also be called remotely.

Hint

For more information, see the Documentation Programming with External Commands in SAP Help Portal.

Example

Calls the operating system statement ping for the central database server of the system on the host computer of the current AS instance using the logical command name PING defined by SAP. The result of the call is passed to the internal table result. The function module SXPG\_CALL\_SYSTEM can raise more specific exceptions than those handled explicitly here.

Unwanted Calls of Operating System Statements

Alongside calls of function modules in the [SXPG framework](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm), operating system statements for the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance can be executed in ABAP programs as follows:

-   The addition [FILTER](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_os_addition.htm) of the statement [OPEN DATASET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset.htm) used for executing operating system statements using pipes.

-   The internal statement [CALL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall-.htm) used to call a special system function (SYSTEM), which can be used to execute operating system statements.

Neither of these options should be used for common execution of operating system statements in ABAP programs.

-   The addition [FILTER](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_os_addition.htm) of [OPEN DATASET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset.htm) should only be used (if at all) for operating system statements required for data handling.

-   Calls of the system function SYSTEM with the internal statement [CALL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall-.htm) should never be made and can be deactivated using the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") rdisp/call\_system. If called, it then raises an uncatchable exception.

Both statements cause the following problems:

-   There are no central authorization checks.

-   The platform dependency of the operating system statements must be handled in the ABAP program itself.

-   Errors and exceptions cannot be handled specifically.

-   If input from external sources is used, it must be checked thoroughly and filtered to prevent [system command injections](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abensys_comm_injections_scrty.htm) on any platform.

If possible, the [SXPG framework](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm) should be used instead of these two options.

Hint

Before the statements CALL 'SYSTEM' is deactivated using the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") rdisp/call\_system, it must be ensured that it is no longer used in any programs. Any programs that still use CALL 'SYSTEM' must first be switched to use of the [SXPG frameworks](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm) before the unwanted statement can be deactivated. The options in the SXPG frameworks generally cover all requirements when calling operating system statements.

Example

Calls the operating system statement ping for the central database server of the system on the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance using the addition FILTER of the statement OPEN DATASET. The output of the operating system statement is written to the opened file and can be read from there.

DATA dbserver TYPE c LENGTH 255.
CALL 'C\_SAPGPARAM' ID 'NAME'¬†¬†FIELD 'SAPDBHOST'
¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ID 'VALUE' FIELD¬†¬†dbserver.

The result of the call is passed to the internal table result. This example can only be executed if the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") rdisp/call\_system allows the call.

ABAP and Operating System Statements

Operating system statements or system commands execute statements or programs directly on the operating system of the host computer of an AS instance or of a presentation server. Executing operating system statements from ABAP programs should be the exception not the rule, however it may become necessary in system or administration programs to call operating system functions that cannot be accessed by ABAP statements. In certain circumstances, input from external sources may need to be passed to the operating system.

-   [Operating System Statements of the Presentation Server](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_pres.htm)

Security Hint

Using input from external sources in operating system statements incurs the risk of [system command injections](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abensys_comm_injections_scrty.htm).

SXPG Framework for Operating System Statements

The only recommended method for executing operating system statements from ABAP on the operating system of the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance or another server is to use the SXPG framework. This framework is based on a list of allowed operating system statements that can be called using function modules in the function pool SXPG.

The list of allowed operating system statements is defined by the system administrator in transaction SM69. Here, the platform-dependent physical operating system statements are assigned to a logical command name used to address them in ABAP. When one of these logical command names is passed to one of the function modules listed below, the operating system statement appropriate for the platform in question is executed. Logical command names assigned to an operating system command used by all platforms can be flagged with the operating system ANYOS. Static parameters can be assigned to any operating system statement and further parameters can be specified for when the statement is called. When an operating system statement is called using a logical command name, implicit authorization checks are performed, accompanied by extra self-defined checks. SAP provides a range of predefined logical command names with the type SAP. Logical command names created by customers have the type KUNDE.

If they have the right authorizations, developers can view the list of operating system statements in transaction SM49 and execute them from here. The following function modules can be called from ABAP programs:

-   SXPG\_CALL\_SYSTEM for execution on the host computer of the current AS instance

-   SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE for execution on other servers; the result can caught, but this is not mandatory

-   SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE\_LONG, like SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE but with a longer list of parameters

These function modules can also be called remotely.

Hint

For more information, see the Documentation Programming with External Commands in SAP Help Portal.

Example

Calls the operating system statement ping for the central database server of the system on the host computer of the current AS instance using the logical command name PING defined by SAP. The result of the call is passed to the internal table result. The function module SXPG\_CALL\_SYSTEM can raise more specific exceptions than those handled explicitly here.

Unwanted Calls of Operating System Statements

Alongside calls of function modules in the [SXPG framework](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm), operating system statements for the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance can be executed in ABAP programs as follows:

-   The addition [FILTER](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_os_addition.htm) of the statement [OPEN DATASET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset.htm) used for executing operating system statements using pipes.

-   The internal statement [CALL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall-.htm) used to call a special system function (SYSTEM), which can be used to execute operating system statements.

Neither of these options should be used for common execution of operating system statements in ABAP programs.

-   The addition [FILTER](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_os_addition.htm) of [OPEN DATASET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset.htm) should only be used (if at all) for operating system statements required for data handling.

-   Calls of the system function SYSTEM with the internal statement [CALL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall-.htm) should never be made and can be deactivated using the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") rdisp/call\_system. If called, it then raises an uncatchable exception.

Both statements cause the following problems:

-   There are no central authorization checks.

-   The platform dependency of the operating system statements must be handled in the ABAP program itself.

-   Errors and exceptions cannot be handled specifically.

-   If input from external sources is used, it must be checked thoroughly and filtered to prevent [system command injections](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abensys_comm_injections_scrty.htm) on any platform.

If possible, the [SXPG framework](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm) should be used instead of these two options.

Hint

Before the statements CALL 'SYSTEM' is deactivated using the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") rdisp/call\_system, it must be ensured that it is no longer used in any programs. Any programs that still use CALL 'SYSTEM' must first be switched to use of the [SXPG frameworks](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm) before the unwanted statement can be deactivated. The options in the SXPG frameworks generally cover all requirements when calling operating system statements.

Example

Calls the operating system statement ping for the central database server of the system on the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance using the addition FILTER of the statement OPEN DATASET. The output of the operating system statement is written to the opened file and can be read from there.

DATA dbserver TYPE c LENGTH 255.
CALL 'C\_SAPGPARAM' ID 'NAME'¬†¬†FIELD 'SAPDBHOST'
¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ID 'VALUE' FIELD¬†¬†dbserver.

The result of the call is passed to the internal table result. This example can only be executed if the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") rdisp/call\_system allows the call.

ABAP and Operating System Statements

Operating system statements or system commands execute statements or programs directly on the operating system of the host computer of an AS instance or of a presentation server. Executing operating system statements from ABAP programs should be the exception not the rule, however it may become necessary in system or administration programs to call operating system functions that cannot be accessed by ABAP statements. In certain circumstances, input from external sources may need to be passed to the operating system.

-   [Operating System Statements of the Presentation Server](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_pres.htm)

Security Hint

Using input from external sources in operating system statements incurs the risk of [system command injections](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abensys_comm_injections_scrty.htm).

SXPG Framework for Operating System Statements

The only recommended method for executing operating system statements from ABAP on the operating system of the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance or another server is to use the SXPG framework. This framework is based on a list of allowed operating system statements that can be called using function modules in the function pool SXPG.

The list of allowed operating system statements is defined by the system administrator in transaction SM69. Here, the platform-dependent physical operating system statements are assigned to a logical command name used to address them in ABAP. When one of these logical command names is passed to one of the function modules listed below, the operating system statement appropriate for the platform in question is executed. Logical command names assigned to an operating system command used by all platforms can be flagged with the operating system ANYOS. Static parameters can be assigned to any operating system statement and further parameters can be specified for when the statement is called. When an operating system statement is called using a logical command name, implicit authorization checks are performed, accompanied by extra self-defined checks. SAP provides a range of predefined logical command names with the type SAP. Logical command names created by customers have the type KUNDE.

If they have the right authorizations, developers can view the list of operating system statements in transaction SM49 and execute them from here. The following function modules can be called from ABAP programs:

-   SXPG\_CALL\_SYSTEM for execution on the host computer of the current AS instance

-   SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE for execution on other servers; the result can caught, but this is not mandatory

-   SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE\_LONG, like SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE but with a longer list of parameters

These function modules can also be called remotely.

Hint

For more information, see the Documentation Programming with External Commands in SAP Help Portal.

Example

Calls the operating system statement ping for the central database server of the system on the host computer of the current AS instance using the logical command name PING defined by SAP. The result of the call is passed to the internal table result. The function module SXPG\_CALL\_SYSTEM can raise more specific exceptions than those handled explicitly here.

Unwanted Calls of Operating System Statements

Alongside calls of function modules in the [SXPG framework](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm), operating system statements for the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance can be executed in ABAP programs as follows:

-   The addition [FILTER](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_os_addition.htm) of the statement [OPEN DATASET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset.htm) used for executing operating system statements using pipes.

-   The internal statement [CALL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall-.htm) used to call a special system function (SYSTEM), which can be used to execute operating system statements.

Neither of these options should be used for common execution of operating system statements in ABAP programs.

-   The addition [FILTER](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_os_addition.htm) of [OPEN DATASET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset.htm) should only be used (if at all) for operating system statements required for data handling.

-   Calls of the system function SYSTEM with the internal statement [CALL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall-.htm) should never be made and can be deactivated using the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") rdisp/call\_system. If called, it then raises an uncatchable exception.

Both statements cause the following problems:

-   There are no central authorization checks.

-   The platform dependency of the operating system statements must be handled in the ABAP program itself.

-   Errors and exceptions cannot be handled specifically.

-   If input from external sources is used, it must be checked thoroughly and filtered to prevent [system command injections](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abensys_comm_injections_scrty.htm) on any platform.

If possible, the [SXPG framework](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm) should be used instead of these two options.

Hint

Before the statements CALL 'SYSTEM' is deactivated using the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") rdisp/call\_system, it must be ensured that it is no longer used in any programs. Any programs that still use CALL 'SYSTEM' must first be switched to use of the [SXPG frameworks](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm) before the unwanted statement can be deactivated. The options in the SXPG frameworks generally cover all requirements when calling operating system statements.

Example

Calls the operating system statement ping for the central database server of the system on the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance using the addition FILTER of the statement OPEN DATASET. The output of the operating system statement is written to the opened file and can be read from there.

DATA dbserver TYPE c LENGTH 255.

The result of the call is passed to the internal table result. This example can only be executed if the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") rdisp/call\_system allows the call.

SXPG Framework for Operating System Statements

The only recommended method for executing operating system statements from ABAP on the operating system of the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance or another server is to use the SXPG framework. This framework is based on a list of allowed operating system statements that can be called using function modules in the function pool SXPG.

The list of allowed operating system statements is defined by the system administrator in transaction SM69. Here, the platform-dependent physical operating system statements are assigned to a logical command name used to address them in ABAP. When one of these logical command names is passed to one of the function modules listed below, the operating system statement appropriate for the platform in question is executed. Logical command names assigned to an operating system command used by all platforms can be flagged with the operating system ANYOS. Static parameters can be assigned to any operating system statement and further parameters can be specified for when the statement is called. When an operating system statement is called using a logical command name, implicit authorization checks are performed, accompanied by extra self-defined checks. SAP provides a range of predefined logical command names with the type SAP. Logical command names created by customers have the type KUNDE.

If they have the right authorizations, developers can view the list of operating system statements in transaction SM49 and execute them from here. The following function modules can be called from ABAP programs:

-   SXPG\_CALL\_SYSTEM for execution on the host computer of the current AS instance

-   SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE for execution on other servers; the result can caught, but this is not mandatory

-   SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE\_LONG, like SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE but with a longer list of parameters

These function modules can also be called remotely.

Hint

For more information, see the Documentation Programming with External Commands in SAP Help Portal.

Example

Calls the operating system statement ping for the central database server of the system on the host computer of the current AS instance using the logical command name PING defined by SAP. The result of the call is passed to the internal table result. The function module SXPG\_CALL\_SYSTEM can raise more specific exceptions than those handled explicitly here.

Unwanted Calls of Operating System Statements

Alongside calls of function modules in the [SXPG framework](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm), operating system statements for the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance can be executed in ABAP programs as follows:

-   The addition [FILTER](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_os_addition.htm) of the statement [OPEN DATASET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset.htm) used for executing operating system statements using pipes.

-   The internal statement [CALL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall-.htm) used to call a special system function (SYSTEM), which can be used to execute operating system statements.

Neither of these options should be used for common execution of operating system statements in ABAP programs.

-   The addition [FILTER](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_os_addition.htm) of [OPEN DATASET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset.htm) should only be used (if at all) for operating system statements required for data handling.

-   Calls of the system function SYSTEM with the internal statement [CALL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall-.htm) should never be made and can be deactivated using the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") rdisp/call\_system. If called, it then raises an uncatchable exception.

Both statements cause the following problems:

-   There are no central authorization checks.

-   The platform dependency of the operating system statements must be handled in the ABAP program itself.

-   Errors and exceptions cannot be handled specifically.

-   If input from external sources is used, it must be checked thoroughly and filtered to prevent [system command injections](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abensys_comm_injections_scrty.htm) on any platform.

If possible, the [SXPG framework](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm) should be used instead of these two options.

Hint

Before the statements CALL 'SYSTEM' is deactivated using the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") rdisp/call\_system, it must be ensured that it is no longer used in any programs. Any programs that still use CALL 'SYSTEM' must first be switched to use of the [SXPG frameworks](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm) before the unwanted statement can be deactivated. The options in the SXPG frameworks generally cover all requirements when calling operating system statements.

Example

Calls the operating system statement ping for the central database server of the system on the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance using the addition FILTER of the statement OPEN DATASET. The output of the operating system statement is written to the opened file and can be read from there.

DATA dbserver TYPE c LENGTH 255.

The result of the call is passed to the internal table result. This example can only be executed if the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") rdisp/call\_system allows the call.

ABAP and Operating System Statements

Operating system statements or system commands execute statements or programs directly on the operating system of the host computer of an AS instance or of a presentation server. Executing operating system statements from ABAP programs should be the exception not the rule, however it may become necessary in system or administration programs to call operating system functions that cannot be accessed by ABAP statements. In certain circumstances, input from external sources may need to be passed to the operating system.

-   [Operating System Statements of the Host Computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl.htm)

-   [Operating System Statements of the Presentation Server](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_pres.htm)

Security Hint

Using input from external sources in operating system statements incurs the risk of [system command injections](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abensys_comm_injections_scrty.htm).

This framework is based on a list of allowed operating system statements that can be called using function modules in the function pool SXPG.

The list of allowed operating system statements is defined by the system administrator in transaction SM69. Here, the platform-dependent physical operating system statements are assigned to a logical command name used to address them in ABAP. When one of these logical command names is passed to one of the function modules listed below, the operating system statement appropriate for the platform in question is executed. Logical command names assigned to an operating system command used by all platforms can be flagged with the operating system ANYOS. Static parameters can be assigned to any operating system statement and further parameters can be specified for when the statement is called. When an operating system statement is called using a logical command name, implicit authorization checks are performed, accompanied by extra self-defined checks. SAP provides a range of predefined logical command names with the type SAP. Logical command names created by customers have the type KUNDE.

If they have the right authorizations, developers can view the list of operating system statements in transaction SM49 and execute them from here. The following function modules can be called from ABAP programs:

-   SXPG\_CALL\_SYSTEM for execution on the host computer of the current AS instance

-   SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE for execution on other servers; the result can caught, but this is not mandatory

-   SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE\_LONG, like SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE but with a longer list of parameters

These function modules can also be called remotely.

Hint

For more information, see the Documentation Programming with External Commands in SAP Help Portal.

Example

Calls the operating system statement ping for the central database server of the system on the host computer of the current AS instance using the logical command name PING defined by SAP. The result of the call is passed to the internal table result. The function module SXPG\_CALL\_SYSTEM can raise more specific exceptions than those handled explicitly here.

Unwanted Calls of Operating System Statements

Alongside calls of function modules in the [SXPG framework](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm), operating system statements for the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance can be executed in ABAP programs as follows:

-   The addition [FILTER](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_os_addition.htm) of the statement [OPEN DATASET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset.htm) used for executing operating system statements using pipes.

-   The internal statement [CALL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall-.htm) used to call a special system function (SYSTEM), which can be used to execute operating system statements.

Neither of these options should be used for common execution of operating system statements in ABAP programs.

-   The addition [FILTER](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_os_addition.htm) of [OPEN DATASET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset.htm) should only be used (if at all) for operating system statements required for data handling.

-   Calls of the system function SYSTEM with the internal statement [CALL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall-.htm) should never be made and can be deactivated using the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") rdisp/call\_system. If called, it then raises an uncatchable exception.

Both statements cause the following problems:

-   There are no central authorization checks.

-   The platform dependency of the operating system statements must be handled in the ABAP program itself.

-   Errors and exceptions cannot be handled specifically.

-   If input from external sources is used, it must be checked thoroughly and filtered to prevent [system command injections](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abensys_comm_injections_scrty.htm) on any platform.

If possible, the [SXPG framework](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm) should be used instead of these two options.

Hint

Before the statements CALL 'SYSTEM' is deactivated using the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") rdisp/call\_system, it must be ensured that it is no longer used in any programs. Any programs that still use CALL 'SYSTEM' must first be switched to use of the [SXPG frameworks](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm) before the unwanted statement can be deactivated. The options in the SXPG frameworks generally cover all requirements when calling operating system statements.

Example

Calls the operating system statement ping for the central database server of the system on the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance using the addition FILTER of the statement OPEN DATASET. The output of the operating system statement is written to the opened file and can be read from there.

The result of the call is passed to the internal table result. This example can only be executed if the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") rdisp/call\_system allows the call.

ABAP and Operating System Statements

Operating system statements or system commands execute statements or programs directly on the operating system of the host computer of an AS instance or of a presentation server. Executing operating system statements from ABAP programs should be the exception not the rule, however it may become necessary in system or administration programs to call operating system functions that cannot be accessed by ABAP statements. In certain circumstances, input from external sources may need to be passed to the operating system.

-   [Operating System Statements of the Host Computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl.htm)

-   [Operating System Statements of the Presentation Server](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_pres.htm)

Security Hint

Using input from external sources in operating system statements incurs the risk of [system command injections](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abensys_comm_injections_scrty.htm).

SXPG Framework for Operating System Statements

The only recommended method for executing operating system statements from ABAP on the operating system of the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance or another server is to use the SXPG framework. This framework is based on a list of allowed operating system statements that can be called using function modules in the function pool SXPG.

The list of allowed operating system statements is defined by the system administrator in transaction SM69. Here, the platform-dependent physical operating system statements are assigned to a logical command name used to address them in ABAP. When one of these logical command names is passed to one of the function modules listed below, the operating system statement appropriate for the platform in question is executed. Logical command names assigned to an operating system command used by all platforms can be flagged with the operating system ANYOS. Static parameters can be assigned to any operating system statement and further parameters can be specified for when the statement is called. When an operating system statement is called using a logical command name, implicit authorization checks are performed, accompanied by extra self-defined checks. SAP provides a range of predefined logical command names with the type SAP. Logical command names created by customers have the type KUNDE.

If they have the right authorizations, developers can view the list of operating system statements in transaction SM49 and execute them from here. The following function modules can be called from ABAP programs:

-   SXPG\_CALL\_SYSTEM for execution on the host computer of the current AS instance

-   SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE for execution on other servers; the result can caught, but this is not mandatory

-   SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE\_LONG, like SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE but with a longer list of parameters

These function modules can also be called remotely.

Hint

For more information, see the Documentation Programming with External Commands in SAP Help Portal.

Example

Calls the operating system statement ping for the central database server of the system on the host computer of the current AS instance using the logical command name PING defined by SAP. The result of the call is passed to the internal table result. The function module SXPG\_CALL\_SYSTEM can raise more specific exceptions than those handled explicitly here.

Unwanted Calls of Operating System Statements

Alongside calls of function modules in the [SXPG framework](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm), operating system statements for the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance can be executed in ABAP programs as follows:

-   The addition [FILTER](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_os_addition.htm) of the statement [OPEN DATASET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset.htm) used for executing operating system statements using pipes.

-   The internal statement [CALL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall-.htm) used to call a special system function (SYSTEM), which can be used to execute operating system statements.

Neither of these options should be used for common execution of operating system statements in ABAP programs.

-   The addition [FILTER](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_os_addition.htm) of [OPEN DATASET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset.htm) should only be used (if at all) for operating system statements required for data handling.

-   Calls of the system function SYSTEM with the internal statement [CALL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall-.htm) should never be made and can be deactivated using the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") rdisp/call\_system. If called, it then raises an uncatchable exception.

Both statements cause the following problems:

-   There are no central authorization checks.

-   The platform dependency of the operating system statements must be handled in the ABAP program itself.

-   Errors and exceptions cannot be handled specifically.

-   If input from external sources is used, it must be checked thoroughly and filtered to prevent [system command injections](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abensys_comm_injections_scrty.htm) on any platform.

If possible, the [SXPG framework](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm) should be used instead of these two options.

Hint

Before the statements CALL 'SYSTEM' is deactivated using the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") rdisp/call\_system, it must be ensured that it is no longer used in any programs. Any programs that still use CALL 'SYSTEM' must first be switched to use of the [SXPG frameworks](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm) before the unwanted statement can be deactivated. The options in the SXPG frameworks generally cover all requirements when calling operating system statements.

Example

Calls the operating system statement ping for the central database server of the system on the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance using the addition FILTER of the statement OPEN DATASET. The output of the operating system statement is written to the opened file and can be read from there.

DATA dbserver TYPE c LENGTH 255.

The result of the call is passed to the internal table result. This example can only be executed if the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") rdisp/call\_system allows the call.

ABAP and Operating System Statements

Operating system statements or system commands execute statements or programs directly on the operating system of the host computer of an AS instance or of a presentation server. Executing operating system statements from ABAP programs should be the exception not the rule, however it may become necessary in system or administration programs to call operating system functions that cannot be accessed by ABAP statements. In certain circumstances, input from external sources may need to be passed to the operating system.

-   [Operating System Statements of the Host Computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl.htm)

-   [Operating System Statements of the Presentation Server](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_pres.htm)

Security Hint

Using input from external sources in operating system statements incurs the risk of [system command injections](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abensys_comm_injections_scrty.htm).

SXPG Framework for Operating System Statements

The only recommended method for executing operating system statements from ABAP on the operating system of the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance or another server is to use the SXPG framework. This framework is based on a list of allowed operating system statements that can be called using function modules in the function pool SXPG.

The list of allowed operating system statements is defined by the system administrator in transaction SM69. Here, the platform-dependent physical operating system statements are assigned to a logical command name used to address them in ABAP. When one of these logical command names is passed to one of the function modules listed below, the operating system statement appropriate for the platform in question is executed. Logical command names assigned to an operating system command used by all platforms can be flagged with the operating system ANYOS. Static parameters can be assigned to any operating system statement and further parameters can be specified for when the statement is called. When an operating system statement is called using a logical command name, implicit authorization checks are performed, accompanied by extra self-defined checks. SAP provides a range of predefined logical command names with the type SAP. Logical command names created by customers have the type KUNDE.

If they have the right authorizations, developers can view the list of operating system statements in transaction SM49 and execute them from here. The following function modules can be called from ABAP programs:

-   SXPG\_CALL\_SYSTEM for execution on the host computer of the current AS instance

-   SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE for execution on other servers; the result can caught, but this is not mandatory

-   SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE\_LONG, like SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE but with a longer list of parameters

These function modules can also be called remotely.

Hint

For more information, see the Documentation Programming with External Commands in SAP Help Portal.

Example

Calls the operating system statement ping for the central database server of the system on the host computer of the current AS instance using the logical command name PING defined by SAP. The result of the call is passed to the internal table result. The function module SXPG\_CALL\_SYSTEM can raise more specific exceptions than those handled explicitly here.

Unwanted Calls of Operating System Statements

Alongside calls of function modules in the [SXPG framework](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm), operating system statements for the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance can be executed in ABAP programs as follows:

-   The addition [FILTER](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_os_addition.htm) of the statement [OPEN DATASET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset.htm) used for executing operating system statements using pipes.

-   The internal statement [CALL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall-.htm) used to call a special system function (SYSTEM), which can be used to execute operating system statements.

Neither of these options should be used for common execution of operating system statements in ABAP programs.

-   The addition [FILTER](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_os_addition.htm) of [OPEN DATASET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset.htm) should only be used (if at all) for operating system statements required for data handling.

-   Calls of the system function SYSTEM with the internal statement [CALL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall-.htm) should never be made and can be deactivated using the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") rdisp/call\_system. If called, it then raises an uncatchable exception.

Both statements cause the following problems:

-   There are no central authorization checks.

-   The platform dependency of the operating system statements must be handled in the ABAP program itself.

-   Errors and exceptions cannot be handled specifically.

-   If input from external sources is used, it must be checked thoroughly and filtered to prevent [system command injections](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abensys_comm_injections_scrty.htm) on any platform.

If possible, the [SXPG framework](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm) should be used instead of these two options.

Hint

Before the statements CALL 'SYSTEM' is deactivated using the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") rdisp/call\_system, it must be ensured that it is no longer used in any programs. Any programs that still use CALL 'SYSTEM' must first be switched to use of the [SXPG frameworks](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm) before the unwanted statement can be deactivated. The options in the SXPG frameworks generally cover all requirements when calling operating system statements.

Example

Calls the operating system statement ping for the central database server of the system on the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance using the addition FILTER of the statement OPEN DATASET. The output of the operating system statement is written to the opened file and can be read from there.

ABAP and Operating System Statements

Operating system statements or system commands execute statements or programs directly on the operating system of the host computer of an AS instance or of a presentation server. Executing operating system statements from ABAP programs should be the exception not the rule, however it may become necessary in system or administration programs to call operating system functions that cannot be accessed by ABAP statements. In certain circumstances, input from external sources may need to be passed to the operating system.

-   [Operating System Statements of the Host Computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl.htm)

-   [Operating System Statements of the Presentation Server](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_pres.htm)

Security Hint

Using input from external sources in operating system statements incurs the risk of [system command injections](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abensys_comm_injections_scrty.htm).

SXPG Framework for Operating System Statements

The only recommended method for executing operating system statements from ABAP on the operating system of the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance or another server is to use the SXPG framework. This framework is based on a list of allowed operating system statements that can be called using function modules in the function pool SXPG.

The list of allowed operating system statements is defined by the system administrator in transaction SM69. Here, the platform-dependent physical operating system statements are assigned to a logical command name used to address them in ABAP. When one of these logical command names is passed to one of the function modules listed below, the operating system statement appropriate for the platform in question is executed. Logical command names assigned to an operating system command used by all platforms can be flagged with the operating system ANYOS. Static parameters can be assigned to any operating system statement and further parameters can be specified for when the statement is called. When an operating system statement is called using a logical command name, implicit authorization checks are performed, accompanied by extra self-defined checks. SAP provides a range of predefined logical command names with the type SAP. Logical command names created by customers have the type KUNDE.

If they have the right authorizations, developers can view the list of operating system statements in transaction SM49 and execute them from here. The following function modules can be called from ABAP programs:

-   SXPG\_CALL\_SYSTEM for execution on the host computer of the current AS instance

-   SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE for execution on other servers; the result can caught, but this is not mandatory

-   SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE\_LONG, like SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE but with a longer list of parameters

These function modules can also be called remotely.

Hint

For more information, see the Documentation Programming with External Commands in SAP Help Portal.

Example

Calls the operating system statement ping for the central database server of the system on the host computer of the current AS instance using the logical command name PING defined by SAP. The result of the call is passed to the internal table result. The function module SXPG\_CALL\_SYSTEM can raise more specific exceptions than those handled explicitly here.

Unwanted Calls of Operating System Statements

Alongside calls of function modules in the [SXPG framework](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm), operating system statements for the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance can be executed in ABAP programs as follows:

-   The addition [FILTER](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_os_addition.htm) of the statement [OPEN DATASET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset.htm) used for executing operating system statements using pipes.

-   The internal statement [CALL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall-.htm) used to call a special system function (SYSTEM), which can be used to execute operating system statements.

Neither of these options should be used for common execution of operating system statements in ABAP programs.

-   The addition [FILTER](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_os_addition.htm) of [OPEN DATASET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset.htm) should only be used (if at all) for operating system statements required for data handling.

-   Calls of the system function SYSTEM with the internal statement [CALL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall-.htm) should never be made and can be deactivated using the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") rdisp/call\_system. If called, it then raises an uncatchable exception.

Both statements cause the following problems:

-   There are no central authorization checks.

-   The platform dependency of the operating system statements must be handled in the ABAP program itself.

-   Errors and exceptions cannot be handled specifically.

-   If input from external sources is used, it must be checked thoroughly and filtered to prevent [system command injections](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abensys_comm_injections_scrty.htm) on any platform.

If possible, the [SXPG framework](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm) should be used instead of these two options.

Hint

Before the statements CALL 'SYSTEM' is deactivated using the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") rdisp/call\_system, it must be ensured that it is no longer used in any programs. Any programs that still use CALL 'SYSTEM' must first be switched to use of the [SXPG frameworks](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm) before the unwanted statement can be deactivated. The options in the SXPG frameworks generally cover all requirements when calling operating system statements.

Example

Calls the operating system statement ping for the central database server of the system on the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance using the addition FILTER of the statement OPEN DATASET.

ABAP and Operating System Statements

Operating system statements or system commands execute statements or programs directly on the operating system of the host computer of an AS instance or of a presentation server. Executing operating system statements from ABAP programs should be the exception not the rule, however it may become necessary in system or administration programs to call operating system functions that cannot be accessed by ABAP statements. In certain circumstances, input from external sources may need to be passed to the operating system.

-   [Operating System Statements of the Host Computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl.htm)

-   [Operating System Statements of the Presentation Server](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_pres.htm)

Security Hint

Using input from external sources in operating system statements incurs the risk of [system command injections](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abensys_comm_injections_scrty.htm).

SXPG Framework for Operating System Statements

The only recommended method for executing operating system statements from ABAP on the operating system of the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance or another server is to use the SXPG framework. This framework is based on a list of allowed operating system statements that can be called using function modules in the function pool SXPG.

The list of allowed operating system statements is defined by the system administrator in transaction SM69. Here, the platform-dependent physical operating system statements are assigned to a logical command name used to address them in ABAP. When one of these logical command names is passed to one of the function modules listed below, the operating system statement appropriate for the platform in question is executed. Logical command names assigned to an operating system command used by all platforms can be flagged with the operating system ANYOS. Static parameters can be assigned to any operating system statement and further parameters can be specified for when the statement is called. When an operating system statement is called using a logical command name, implicit authorization checks are performed, accompanied by extra self-defined checks. SAP provides a range of predefined logical command names with the type SAP. Logical command names created by customers have the type KUNDE.

If they have the right authorizations, developers can view the list of operating system statements in transaction SM49 and execute them from here. The following function modules can be called from ABAP programs:

-   SXPG\_CALL\_SYSTEM for execution on the host computer of the current AS instance

-   SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE for execution on other servers; the result can caught, but this is not mandatory

-   SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE\_LONG, like SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE but with a longer list of parameters

These function modules can also be called remotely.

Hint

For more information, see the Documentation Programming with External Commands in SAP Help Portal.

Example

Calls the operating system statement ping for the central database server of the system on the host computer of the current AS instance using the logical command name PING defined by SAP. The result of the call is passed to the internal table result. The function module SXPG\_CALL\_SYSTEM can raise more specific exceptions than those handled explicitly here.

Unwanted Calls of Operating System Statements

Alongside calls of function modules in the [SXPG framework](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm), operating system statements for the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance can be executed in ABAP programs as follows:

-   The addition [FILTER](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_os_addition.htm) of the statement [OPEN DATASET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset.htm) used for executing operating system statements using pipes.

-   The internal statement [CALL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall-.htm) used to call a special system function (SYSTEM), which can be used to execute operating system statements.

Neither of these options should be used for common execution of operating system statements in ABAP programs.

-   The addition [FILTER](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_os_addition.htm) of [OPEN DATASET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset.htm) should only be used (if at all) for operating system statements required for data handling.

-   Calls of the system function SYSTEM with the internal statement [CALL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall-.htm) should never be made and can be deactivated using the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") rdisp/call\_system. If called, it then raises an uncatchable exception.

Both statements cause the following problems:

-   There are no central authorization checks.

-   The platform dependency of the operating system statements must be handled in the ABAP program itself.

-   Errors and exceptions cannot be handled specifically.

-   If input from external sources is used, it must be checked thoroughly and filtered to prevent [system command injections](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abensys_comm_injections_scrty.htm) on any platform.

If possible, the [SXPG framework](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm) should be used instead of these two options.

Hint

Before the statements CALL 'SYSTEM' is deactivated using the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") rdisp/call\_system, it must be ensured that it is no longer used in any programs. Any programs that still use CALL 'SYSTEM' must first be switched to use of the [SXPG frameworks](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm) before the unwanted statement can be deactivated. The options in the SXPG frameworks generally cover all requirements when calling operating system statements.

Example

Calls the operating system statement ping for the central database server of the system on the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance using the addition FILTER of the statement OPEN DATASET. The output of the operating system statement is written to the opened file and can be read from there.

DATA dbserver TYPE c LENGTH 255.
CALL 'C\_SAPGPARAM' ID 'NAME'¬†¬†FIELD 'SAPDBHOST'
¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ID 'VALUE' FIELD¬†¬†dbserver.

DATA result TYPE xstring.
READ DATASET fname INTO result.
CLOSE DATASET fname.

The result of the call is passed to the internal table result. This example can only be executed if the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") rdisp/call\_system allows the call.

Operating System Statements of the Presentation Server

The method EXECUTE of the class [CL\_GUI\_FRONTEND\_SERVICES](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenfrontend_services.htm) can be used to call operating system statements of the presentation server.

ABAP and Operating System Statements

Operating system statements or system commands execute statements or programs directly on the operating system of the host computer of an AS instance or of a presentation server. Executing operating system statements from ABAP programs should be the exception not the rule, however it may become necessary in system or administration programs to call operating system functions that cannot be accessed by ABAP statements. In certain circumstances, input from external sources may need to be passed to the operating system.

-   [Operating System Statements of the Presentation Server](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_pres.htm)

Security Hint

Using input from external sources in operating system statements incurs the risk of [system command injections](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abensys_comm_injections_scrty.htm).

SXPG Framework for Operating System Statements

The only recommended method for executing operating system statements from ABAP on the operating system of the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance or another server is to use the SXPG framework. This framework is based on a list of allowed operating system statements that can be called using function modules in the function pool SXPG.

The list of allowed operating system statements is defined by the system administrator in transaction SM69. Here, the platform-dependent physical operating system statements are assigned to a logical command name used to address them in ABAP. When one of these logical command names is passed to one of the function modules listed below, the operating system statement appropriate for the platform in question is executed. Logical command names assigned to an operating system command used by all platforms can be flagged with the operating system ANYOS. Static parameters can be assigned to any operating system statement and further parameters can be specified for when the statement is called. When an operating system statement is called using a logical command name, implicit authorization checks are performed, accompanied by extra self-defined checks. SAP provides a range of predefined logical command names with the type SAP. Logical command names created by customers have the type KUNDE.

If they have the right authorizations, developers can view the list of operating system statements in transaction SM49 and execute them from here. The following function modules can be called from ABAP programs:

-   SXPG\_CALL\_SYSTEM for execution on the host computer of the current AS instance

-   SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE for execution on other servers; the result can caught, but this is not mandatory

-   SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE\_LONG, like SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE but with a longer list of parameters

These function modules can also be called remotely.

Hint

For more information, see the Documentation Programming with External Commands in SAP Help Portal.

Example

Calls the operating system statement ping for the central database server of the system on the host computer of the current AS instance using the logical command name PING defined by SAP. The result of the call is passed to the internal table result. The function module SXPG\_CALL\_SYSTEM can raise more specific exceptions than those handled explicitly here.

Unwanted Calls of Operating System Statements

Alongside calls of function modules in the [SXPG framework](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm), operating system statements for the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance can be executed in ABAP programs as follows:

-   The addition [FILTER](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_os_addition.htm) of the statement [OPEN DATASET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset.htm) used for executing operating system statements using pipes.

-   The internal statement [CALL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall-.htm) used to call a special system function (SYSTEM), which can be used to execute operating system statements.

Neither of these options should be used for common execution of operating system statements in ABAP programs.

-   The addition [FILTER](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_os_addition.htm) of [OPEN DATASET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset.htm) should only be used (if at all) for operating system statements required for data handling.

-   Calls of the system function SYSTEM with the internal statement [CALL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall-.htm) should never be made and can be deactivated using the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") rdisp/call\_system. If called, it then raises an uncatchable exception.

Both statements cause the following problems:

-   There are no central authorization checks.

-   The platform dependency of the operating system statements must be handled in the ABAP program itself.

-   Errors and exceptions cannot be handled specifically.

-   If input from external sources is used, it must be checked thoroughly and filtered to prevent [system command injections](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abensys_comm_injections_scrty.htm) on any platform.

If possible, the [SXPG framework](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm) should be used instead of these two options.

Hint

Before the statements CALL 'SYSTEM' is deactivated using the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") rdisp/call\_system, it must be ensured that it is no longer used in any programs. Any programs that still use CALL 'SYSTEM' must first be switched to use of the [SXPG frameworks](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm) before the unwanted statement can be deactivated. The options in the SXPG frameworks generally cover all requirements when calling operating system statements.

Example

Calls the operating system statement ping for the central database server of the system on the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance using the addition FILTER of the statement OPEN DATASET. The output of the operating system statement is written to the opened file and can be read from there.

DATA dbserver TYPE c LENGTH 255.

The result of the call is passed to the internal table result. This example can only be executed if the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") rdisp/call\_system allows the call.

ABAP and Operating System Statements

Operating system statements or system commands execute statements or programs directly on the operating system of the host computer of an AS instance or of a presentation server. Executing operating system statements from ABAP programs should be the exception not the rule, however it may become necessary in system or administration programs to call operating system functions that cannot be accessed by ABAP statements. In certain circumstances, input from external sources may need to be passed to the operating system.

-   [Operating System Statements of the Presentation Server](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_pres.htm)

Security Hint

Using input from external sources in operating system statements incurs the risk of [system command injections](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abensys_comm_injections_scrty.htm).

SXPG Framework for Operating System Statements

The only recommended method for executing operating system statements from ABAP on the operating system of the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance or another server is to use the SXPG framework. This framework is based on a list of allowed operating system statements that can be called using function modules in the function pool SXPG.

The list of allowed operating system statements is defined by the system administrator in transaction SM69. Here, the platform-dependent physical operating system statements are assigned to a logical command name used to address them in ABAP. When one of these logical command names is passed to one of the function modules listed below, the operating system statement appropriate for the platform in question is executed. Logical command names assigned to an operating system command used by all platforms can be flagged with the operating system ANYOS. Static parameters can be assigned to any operating system statement and further parameters can be specified for when the statement is called. When an operating system statement is called using a logical command name, implicit authorization checks are performed, accompanied by extra self-defined checks. SAP provides a range of predefined logical command names with the type SAP. Logical command names created by customers have the type KUNDE.

If they have the right authorizations, developers can view the list of operating system statements in transaction SM49 and execute them from here. The following function modules can be called from ABAP programs:

-   SXPG\_CALL\_SYSTEM for execution on the host computer of the current AS instance

-   SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE for execution on other servers; the result can caught, but this is not mandatory

-   SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE\_LONG, like SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE but with a longer list of parameters

These function modules can also be called remotely.

Hint

For more information, see the Documentation Programming with External Commands in SAP Help Portal.

Example

Calls the operating system statement ping for the central database server of the system on the host computer of the current AS instance using the logical command name PING defined by SAP. The result of the call is passed to the internal table result. The function module SXPG\_CALL\_SYSTEM can raise more specific exceptions than those handled explicitly here.

Unwanted Calls of Operating System Statements

Alongside calls of function modules in the [SXPG framework](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm), operating system statements for the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance can be executed in ABAP programs as follows:

-   The addition [FILTER](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_os_addition.htm) of the statement [OPEN DATASET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset.htm) used for executing operating system statements using pipes.

-   The internal statement [CALL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall-.htm) used to call a special system function (SYSTEM), which can be used to execute operating system statements.

Neither of these options should be used for common execution of operating system statements in ABAP programs.

-   The addition [FILTER](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_os_addition.htm) of [OPEN DATASET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset.htm) should only be used (if at all) for operating system statements required for data handling.

-   Calls of the system function SYSTEM with the internal statement [CALL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall-.htm) should never be made and can be deactivated using the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") rdisp/call\_system. If called, it then raises an uncatchable exception.

Both statements cause the following problems:

-   There are no central authorization checks.

-   The platform dependency of the operating system statements must be handled in the ABAP program itself.

-   Errors and exceptions cannot be handled specifically.

-   If input from external sources is used, it must be checked thoroughly and filtered to prevent [system command injections](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abensys_comm_injections_scrty.htm) on any platform.

If possible, the [SXPG framework](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm) should be used instead of these two options.

Hint

Before the statements CALL 'SYSTEM' is deactivated using the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") rdisp/call\_system, it must be ensured that it is no longer used in any programs. Any programs that still use CALL 'SYSTEM' must first be switched to use of the [SXPG frameworks](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm) before the unwanted statement can be deactivated. The options in the SXPG frameworks generally cover all requirements when calling operating system statements.

Example

Calls the operating system statement ping for the central database server of the system on the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance using the addition FILTER of the statement OPEN DATASET. The output of the operating system statement is written to the opened file and can be read from there.

DATA dbserver TYPE c LENGTH 255.
CALL 'C\_SAPGPARAM' ID 'NAME'¬†¬†FIELD 'SAPDBHOST'
¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ID 'VALUE' FIELD¬†¬†dbserver.

The result of the call is passed to the internal table result. This example can only be executed if the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") rdisp/call\_system allows the call.

ABAP and Operating System Statements

Operating system statements or system commands execute statements or programs directly on the operating system of the host computer of an AS instance or of a presentation server. Executing operating system statements from ABAP programs should be the exception not the rule, however it may become necessary in system or administration programs to call operating system functions that cannot be accessed by ABAP statements. In certain circumstances, input from external sources may need to be passed to the operating system.

SXPG Framework for Operating System Statements

The only recommended method for executing operating system statements from ABAP on the operating system of the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance or another server is to use the SXPG framework. This framework is based on a list of allowed operating system statements that can be called using function modules in the function pool SXPG.

The list of allowed operating system statements is defined by the system administrator in transaction SM69. Here, the platform-dependent physical operating system statements are assigned to a logical command name used to address them in ABAP. When one of these logical command names is passed to one of the function modules listed below, the operating system statement appropriate for the platform in question is executed. Logical command names assigned to an operating system command used by all platforms can be flagged with the operating system ANYOS. Static parameters can be assigned to any operating system statement and further parameters can be specified for when the statement is called. When an operating system statement is called using a logical command name, implicit authorization checks are performed, accompanied by extra self-defined checks. SAP provides a range of predefined logical command names with the type SAP. Logical command names created by customers have the type KUNDE.

If they have the right authorizations, developers can view the list of operating system statements in transaction SM49 and execute them from here. The following function modules can be called from ABAP programs:

-   SXPG\_CALL\_SYSTEM for execution on the host computer of the current AS instance

-   SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE for execution on other servers; the result can caught, but this is not mandatory

-   SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE\_LONG, like SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE but with a longer list of parameters

These function modules can also be called remotely.

Hint

For more information, see the Documentation Programming with External Commands in SAP Help Portal.

Example

Calls the operating system statement ping for the central database server of the system on the host computer of the current AS instance using the logical command name PING defined by SAP. The result of the call is passed to the internal table result. The function module SXPG\_CALL\_SYSTEM can raise more specific exceptions than those handled explicitly here.

Unwanted Calls of Operating System Statements

Alongside calls of function modules in the [SXPG framework](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm), operating system statements for the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance can be executed in ABAP programs as follows:

-   The addition [FILTER](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_os_addition.htm) of the statement [OPEN DATASET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset.htm) used for executing operating system statements using pipes.

-   The internal statement [CALL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall-.htm) used to call a special system function (SYSTEM), which can be used to execute operating system statements.

Neither of these options should be used for common execution of operating system statements in ABAP programs.

-   The addition [FILTER](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_os_addition.htm) of [OPEN DATASET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset.htm) should only be used (if at all) for operating system statements required for data handling.

-   Calls of the system function SYSTEM with the internal statement [CALL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall-.htm) should never be made and can be deactivated using the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") rdisp/call\_system. If called, it then raises an uncatchable exception.

Both statements cause the following problems:

-   There are no central authorization checks.

-   The platform dependency of the operating system statements must be handled in the ABAP program itself.

-   Errors and exceptions cannot be handled specifically.

-   If input from external sources is used, it must be checked thoroughly and filtered to prevent [system command injections](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abensys_comm_injections_scrty.htm) on any platform.

If possible, the [SXPG framework](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm) should be used instead of these two options.

Hint

Before the statements CALL 'SYSTEM' is deactivated using the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") rdisp/call\_system, it must be ensured that it is no longer used in any programs. Any programs that still use CALL 'SYSTEM' must first be switched to use of the [SXPG frameworks](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm) before the unwanted statement can be deactivated. The options in the SXPG frameworks generally cover all requirements when calling operating system statements.

Example

Calls the operating system statement ping for the central database server of the system on the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance using the addition FILTER of the statement OPEN DATASET. The output of the operating system statement is written to the opened file and can be read from there.

¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ID 'VALUE' FIELD¬†¬†dbserver.

The result of the call is passed to the internal table result. This example can only be executed if the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") rdisp/call\_system allows the call.

ABAP and Operating System Statements

Operating system statements or system commands execute statements or programs directly on the operating system of the host computer of an AS instance or of a presentation server. Executing operating system statements from ABAP programs should be the exception not the rule, however it may become necessary in system or administration programs to call operating system functions that cannot be accessed by ABAP statements. In certain circumstances, input from external sources may need to be passed to the operating system.

SXPG Framework for Operating System Statements

The only recommended method for executing operating system statements from ABAP on the operating system of the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance or another server is to use the SXPG framework. This framework is based on a list of allowed operating system statements that can be called using function modules in the function pool SXPG.

The list of allowed operating system statements is defined by the system administrator in transaction SM69. Here, the platform-dependent physical operating system statements are assigned to a logical command name used to address them in ABAP. When one of these logical command names is passed to one of the function modules listed below, the operating system statement appropriate for the platform in question is executed. Logical command names assigned to an operating system command used by all platforms can be flagged with the operating system ANYOS. Static parameters can be assigned to any operating system statement and further parameters can be specified for when the statement is called. When an operating system statement is called using a logical command name, implicit authorization checks are performed, accompanied by extra self-defined checks. SAP provides a range of predefined logical command names with the type SAP. Logical command names created by customers have the type KUNDE.

If they have the right authorizations, developers can view the list of operating system statements in transaction SM49 and execute them from here. The following function modules can be called from ABAP programs:

-   SXPG\_CALL\_SYSTEM for execution on the host computer of the current AS instance

-   SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE for execution on other servers; the result can caught, but this is not mandatory

-   SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE\_LONG, like SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE but with a longer list of parameters

These function modules can also be called remotely.

Hint

For more information, see the Documentation Programming with External Commands in SAP Help Portal.

Example

Calls the operating system statement ping for the central database server of the system on the host computer of the current AS instance using the logical command name PING defined by SAP. The result of the call is passed to the internal table result. The function module SXPG\_CALL\_SYSTEM can raise more specific exceptions than those handled explicitly here.

Unwanted Calls of Operating System Statements

Alongside calls of function modules in the [SXPG framework](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm), operating system statements for the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance can be executed in ABAP programs as follows:

-   The addition [FILTER](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_os_addition.htm) of the statement [OPEN DATASET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset.htm) used for executing operating system statements using pipes.

-   The internal statement [CALL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall-.htm) used to call a special system function (SYSTEM), which can be used to execute operating system statements.

Neither of these options should be used for common execution of operating system statements in ABAP programs.

-   The addition [FILTER](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_os_addition.htm) of [OPEN DATASET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset.htm) should only be used (if at all) for operating system statements required for data handling.

-   Calls of the system function SYSTEM with the internal statement [CALL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall-.htm) should never be made and can be deactivated using the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") rdisp/call\_system. If called, it then raises an uncatchable exception.

Both statements cause the following problems:

-   There are no central authorization checks.

-   The platform dependency of the operating system statements must be handled in the ABAP program itself.

-   Errors and exceptions cannot be handled specifically.

-   If input from external sources is used, it must be checked thoroughly and filtered to prevent [system command injections](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abensys_comm_injections_scrty.htm) on any platform.

If possible, the [SXPG framework](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm) should be used instead of these two options.

Hint

Before the statements CALL 'SYSTEM' is deactivated using the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") rdisp/call\_system, it must be ensured that it is no longer used in any programs. Any programs that still use CALL 'SYSTEM' must first be switched to use of the [SXPG frameworks](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm) before the unwanted statement can be deactivated. The options in the SXPG frameworks generally cover all requirements when calling operating system statements.

Example

Calls the operating system statement ping for the central database server of the system on the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance using the addition FILTER of the statement OPEN DATASET. The output of the operating system statement is written to the opened file and can be read from there.

The result of the call is passed to the internal table result. This example can only be executed if the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") rdisp/call\_system allows the call.

ABAP and Operating System Statements

Operating system statements or system commands execute statements or programs directly on the operating system of the host computer of an AS instance or of a presentation server. Executing operating system statements from ABAP programs should be the exception not the rule, however it may become necessary in system or administration programs to call operating system functions that cannot be accessed by ABAP statements. In certain circumstances, input from external sources may need to be passed to the operating system.

-   [Operating System Statements of the Host Computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl.htm)

-   [Operating System Statements of the Presentation Server](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_pres.htm)

Security Hint

Using input from external sources in operating system statements incurs the risk of [system command injections](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abensys_comm_injections_scrty.htm).

SXPG Framework for Operating System Statements

The only recommended method for executing operating system statements from ABAP on the operating system of the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance or another server is to use the SXPG framework. This framework is based on a list of allowed operating system statements that can be called using function modules in the function pool SXPG.

The list of allowed operating system statements is defined by the system administrator in transaction SM69. Here, the platform-dependent physical operating system statements are assigned to a logical command name used to address them in ABAP. When one of these logical command names is passed to one of the function modules listed below, the operating system statement appropriate for the platform in question is executed. Logical command names assigned to an operating system command used by all platforms can be flagged with the operating system ANYOS. Static parameters can be assigned to any operating system statement and further parameters can be specified for when the statement is called. When an operating system statement is called using a logical command name, implicit authorization checks are performed, accompanied by extra self-defined checks. SAP provides a range of predefined logical command names with the type SAP. Logical command names created by customers have the type KUNDE.

If they have the right authorizations, developers can view the list of operating system statements in transaction SM49 and execute them from here. The following function modules can be called from ABAP programs:

-   SXPG\_CALL\_SYSTEM for execution on the host computer of the current AS instance

-   SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE for execution on other servers; the result can caught, but this is not mandatory

-   SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE\_LONG, like SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE but with a longer list of parameters

These function modules can also be called remotely.

Hint

For more information, see the Documentation Programming with External Commands in SAP Help Portal.

Example

Calls the operating system statement ping for the central database server of the system on the host computer of the current AS instance using the logical command name PING defined by SAP. The result of the call is passed to the internal table result. The function module SXPG\_CALL\_SYSTEM can raise more specific exceptions than those handled explicitly here.

Unwanted Calls of Operating System Statements

Alongside calls of function modules in the [SXPG framework](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm), operating system statements for the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance can be executed in ABAP programs as follows:

-   The addition [FILTER](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_os_addition.htm) of the statement [OPEN DATASET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset.htm) used for executing operating system statements using pipes.

-   The internal statement [CALL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall-.htm) used to call a special system function (SYSTEM), which can be used to execute operating system statements.

Neither of these options should be used for common execution of operating system statements in ABAP programs.

-   The addition [FILTER](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_os_addition.htm) of [OPEN DATASET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset.htm) should only be used (if at all) for operating system statements required for data handling.

-   Calls of the system function SYSTEM with the internal statement [CALL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall-.htm) should never be made and can be deactivated using the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") rdisp/call\_system. If called, it then raises an uncatchable exception.

Both statements cause the following problems:

-   There are no central authorization checks.

-   The platform dependency of the operating system statements must be handled in the ABAP program itself.

-   Errors and exceptions cannot be handled specifically.

-   If input from external sources is used, it must be checked thoroughly and filtered to prevent [system command injections](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abensys_comm_injections_scrty.htm) on any platform.

If possible, the [SXPG framework](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm) should be used instead of these two options.

Hint

Before the statements CALL 'SYSTEM' is deactivated using the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") rdisp/call\_system, it must be ensured that it is no longer used in any programs. Any programs that still use CALL 'SYSTEM' must first be switched to use of the [SXPG frameworks](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm) before the unwanted statement can be deactivated. The options in the SXPG frameworks generally cover all requirements when calling operating system statements.

Example

Calls the operating system statement ping for the central database server of the system on the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance using the addition FILTER of the statement OPEN DATASET. The output of the operating system statement is written to the opened file and can be read from there.

The result of the call is passed to the internal table result. This example can only be executed if the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") rdisp/call\_system allows the call.

ABAP and Operating System Statements

Operating system statements or system commands execute statements or programs directly on the operating system of the host computer of an AS instance or of a presentation server. Executing operating system statements from ABAP programs should be the exception not the rule, however it may become necessary in system or administration programs to call operating system functions that cannot be accessed by ABAP statements. In certain circumstances, input from external sources may need to be passed to the operating system.

-   [Operating System Statements of the Host Computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl.htm)

-   [Operating System Statements of the Presentation Server](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_pres.htm)

Security Hint

Using input from external sources in operating system statements incurs the risk of [system command injections](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abensys_comm_injections_scrty.htm).

SXPG Framework for Operating System Statements

The only recommended method for executing operating system statements from ABAP on the operating system of the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance or another server is to use the SXPG framework. This framework is based on a list of allowed operating system statements that can be called using function modules in the function pool SXPG.

The list of allowed operating system statements is defined by the system administrator in transaction SM69. Here, the platform-dependent physical operating system statements are assigned to a logical command name used to address them in ABAP. When one of these logical command names is passed to one of the function modules listed below, the operating system statement appropriate for the platform in question is executed. Logical command names assigned to an operating system command used by all platforms can be flagged with the operating system ANYOS. Static parameters can be assigned to any operating system statement and further parameters can be specified for when the statement is called. When an operating system statement is called using a logical command name, implicit authorization checks are performed, accompanied by extra self-defined checks. SAP provides a range of predefined logical command names with the type SAP. Logical command names created by customers have the type KUNDE.

If they have the right authorizations, developers can view the list of operating system statements in transaction SM49 and execute them from here. The following function modules can be called from ABAP programs:

-   SXPG\_CALL\_SYSTEM for execution on the host computer of the current AS instance

-   SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE for execution on other servers; the result can caught, but this is not mandatory

-   SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE\_LONG, like SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE but with a longer list of parameters

These function modules can also be called remotely.

Hint

For more information, see the Documentation Programming with External Commands in SAP Help Portal.

Example

Calls the operating system statement ping for the central database server of the system on the host computer of the current AS instance using the logical command name PING defined by SAP. The result of the call is passed to the internal table result. The function module SXPG\_CALL\_SYSTEM can raise more specific exceptions than those handled explicitly here.

Unwanted Calls of Operating System Statements

Alongside calls of function modules in the [SXPG framework](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm), operating system statements for the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance can be executed in ABAP programs as follows:

-   The addition [FILTER](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_os_addition.htm) of the statement [OPEN DATASET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset.htm) used for executing operating system statements using pipes.

-   The internal statement [CALL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall-.htm) used to call a special system function (SYSTEM), which can be used to execute operating system statements.

Neither of these options should be used for common execution of operating system statements in ABAP programs.

-   The addition [FILTER](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_os_addition.htm) of [OPEN DATASET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset.htm) should only be used (if at all) for operating system statements required for data handling.

-   Calls of the system function SYSTEM with the internal statement [CALL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall-.htm) should never be made and can be deactivated using the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") rdisp/call\_system. If called, it then raises an uncatchable exception.

Both statements cause the following problems:

-   There are no central authorization checks.

-   The platform dependency of the operating system statements must be handled in the ABAP program itself.

-   Errors and exceptions cannot be handled specifically.

-   If input from external sources is used, it must be checked thoroughly and filtered to prevent [system command injections](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abensys_comm_injections_scrty.htm) on any platform.

If possible, the [SXPG framework](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm) should be used instead of these two options.

Hint

Before the statements CALL 'SYSTEM' is deactivated using the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") rdisp/call\_system, it must be ensured that it is no longer used in any programs. Any programs that still use CALL 'SYSTEM' must first be switched to use of the [SXPG frameworks](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm) before the unwanted statement can be deactivated. The options in the SXPG frameworks generally cover all requirements when calling operating system statements.

Example

Calls the operating system statement ping for the central database server of the system on the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance using the addition FILTER of the statement OPEN DATASET. The output of the operating system statement is written to the opened file and can be read from there.

The result of the call is passed to the internal table result. This example can only be executed if the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") rdisp/call\_system allows the call.

ABAP and Operating System Statements

Operating system statements or system commands execute statements or programs directly on the operating system of the host computer of an AS instance or of a presentation server. Executing operating system statements from ABAP programs should be the exception not the rule, however it may become necessary in system or administration programs to call operating system functions that cannot be accessed by ABAP statements. In certain circumstances, input from external sources may need to be passed to the operating system.

-   [Operating System Statements of the Host Computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl.htm)

-   [Operating System Statements of the Presentation Server](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_pres.htm)

Security Hint

Using input from external sources in operating system statements incurs the risk of [system command injections](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abensys_comm_injections_scrty.htm).

SXPG Framework for Operating System Statements

The only recommended method for executing operating system statements from ABAP on the operating system of the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance or another server is to use the SXPG framework. This framework is based on a list of allowed operating system statements that can be called using function modules in the function pool SXPG.

The list of allowed operating system statements is defined by the system administrator in transaction SM69. Here, the platform-dependent physical operating system statements are assigned to a logical command name used to address them in ABAP. When one of these logical command names is passed to one of the function modules listed below, the operating system statement appropriate for the platform in question is executed. Logical command names assigned to an operating system command used by all platforms can be flagged with the operating system ANYOS. Static parameters can be assigned to any operating system statement and further parameters can be specified for when the statement is called. When an operating system statement is called using a logical command name, implicit authorization checks are performed, accompanied by extra self-defined checks. SAP provides a range of predefined logical command names with the type SAP. Logical command names created by customers have the type KUNDE.

If they have the right authorizations, developers can view the list of operating system statements in transaction SM49 and execute them from here. The following function modules can be called from ABAP programs:

-   SXPG\_CALL\_SYSTEM for execution on the host computer of the current AS instance

-   SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE for execution on other servers; the result can caught, but this is not mandatory

-   SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE\_LONG, like SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE but with a longer list of parameters

These function modules can also be called remotely.

Hint

For more information, see the Documentation Programming with External Commands in SAP Help Portal.

Example

Calls the operating system statement ping for the central database server of the system on the host computer of the current AS instance using the logical command name PING defined by SAP. The result of the call is passed to the internal table result. The function module SXPG\_CALL\_SYSTEM can raise more specific exceptions than those handled explicitly here.

Alongside calls of function modules in the [SXPG framework](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm), operating system statements for the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance can be executed in ABAP programs as follows:

-   The addition [FILTER](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_os_addition.htm) of the statement [OPEN DATASET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset.htm) used for executing operating system statements using pipes.

-   The internal statement [CALL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall-.htm) used to call a special system function (SYSTEM), which can be used to execute operating system statements.

Neither of these options should be used for common execution of operating system statements in ABAP programs.

-   The addition [FILTER](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_os_addition.htm) of [OPEN DATASET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset.htm) should only be used (if at all) for operating system statements required for data handling.

-   Calls of the system function SYSTEM with the internal statement [CALL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall-.htm) should never be made and can be deactivated using the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") rdisp/call\_system. If called, it then raises an uncatchable exception.

Both statements cause the following problems:

-   There are no central authorization checks.

-   The platform dependency of the operating system statements must be handled in the ABAP program itself.

-   Errors and exceptions cannot be handled specifically.

-   If input from external sources is used, it must be checked thoroughly and filtered to prevent [system command injections](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abensys_comm_injections_scrty.htm) on any platform.

If possible, the [SXPG framework](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm) should be used instead of these two options.

Hint

Before the statements CALL 'SYSTEM' is deactivated using the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") rdisp/call\_system, it must be ensured that it is no longer used in any programs. Any programs that still use CALL 'SYSTEM' must first be switched to use of the [SXPG frameworks](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm) before the unwanted statement can be deactivated. The options in the SXPG frameworks generally cover all requirements when calling operating system statements.

Example

Calls the operating system statement ping for the central database server of the system on the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance using the addition FILTER of the statement OPEN DATASET. The output of the operating system statement is written to the opened file and can be read from there.

DATA dbserver TYPE c LENGTH 255.
CALL 'C\_SAPGPARAM' ID 'NAME'¬†¬†FIELD 'SAPDBHOST'
¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ID 'VALUE' FIELD¬†¬†dbserver.

The result of the call is passed to the internal table result. This example can only be executed if the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") rdisp/call\_system allows the call.

ABAP and Operating System Statements

Operating system statements or system commands execute statements or programs directly on the operating system of the host computer of an AS instance or of a presentation server. Executing operating system statements from ABAP programs should be the exception not the rule, however it may become necessary in system or administration programs to call operating system functions that cannot be accessed by ABAP statements. In certain circumstances, input from external sources may need to be passed to the operating system.

-   [Operating System Statements of the Host Computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl.htm)

-   [Operating System Statements of the Presentation Server](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_pres.htm)

Security Hint

Using input from external sources in operating system statements incurs the risk of [system command injections](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abensys_comm_injections_scrty.htm).

SXPG Framework for Operating System Statements

The only recommended method for executing operating system statements from ABAP on the operating system of the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance or another server is to use the SXPG framework. This framework is based on a list of allowed operating system statements that can be called using function modules in the function pool SXPG.

The list of allowed operating system statements is defined by the system administrator in transaction SM69. Here, the platform-dependent physical operating system statements are assigned to a logical command name used to address them in ABAP. When one of these logical command names is passed to one of the function modules listed below, the operating system statement appropriate for the platform in question is executed. Logical command names assigned to an operating system command used by all platforms can be flagged with the operating system ANYOS. Static parameters can be assigned to any operating system statement and further parameters can be specified for when the statement is called. When an operating system statement is called using a logical command name, implicit authorization checks are performed, accompanied by extra self-defined checks. SAP provides a range of predefined logical command names with the type SAP. Logical command names created by customers have the type KUNDE.

If they have the right authorizations, developers can view the list of operating system statements in transaction SM49 and execute them from here. The following function modules can be called from ABAP programs:

-   SXPG\_CALL\_SYSTEM for execution on the host computer of the current AS instance

-   SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE for execution on other servers; the result can caught, but this is not mandatory

-   SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE\_LONG, like SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE but with a longer list of parameters

These function modules can also be called remotely.

Hint

For more information, see the Documentation Programming with External Commands in SAP Help Portal.

Example

Calls the operating system statement ping for the central database server of the system on the host computer of the current AS instance using the logical command name PING defined by SAP. The result of the call is passed to the internal table result. The function module SXPG\_CALL\_SYSTEM can raise more specific exceptions than those handled explicitly here.

Unwanted Calls of Operating System Statements

Alongside calls of function modules in the [SXPG framework](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm), operating system statements for the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance can be executed in ABAP programs as follows:

-   The addition [FILTER](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_os_addition.htm) of the statement [OPEN DATASET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset.htm) used for executing operating system statements using pipes.

-   The internal statement [CALL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall-.htm) used to call a special system function (SYSTEM), which can be used to execute operating system statements.

Neither of these options should be used for common execution of operating system statements in ABAP programs.

-   The addition [FILTER](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_os_addition.htm) of [OPEN DATASET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset.htm) should only be used (if at all) for operating system statements required for data handling.

-   Calls of the system function SYSTEM with the internal statement [CALL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall-.htm) should never be made and can be deactivated using the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") rdisp/call\_system. If called, it then raises an uncatchable exception.

Both statements cause the following problems:

-   There are no central authorization checks.

-   The platform dependency of the operating system statements must be handled in the ABAP program itself.

-   Errors and exceptions cannot be handled specifically.

-   If input from external sources is used, it must be checked thoroughly and filtered to prevent [system command injections](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abensys_comm_injections_scrty.htm) on any platform.

If possible, the [SXPG framework](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm) should be used instead of these two options.

Hint

Before the statements CALL 'SYSTEM' is deactivated using the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") rdisp/call\_system, it must be ensured that it is no longer used in any programs. Any programs that still use CALL 'SYSTEM' must first be switched to use of the [SXPG frameworks](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm) before the unwanted statement can be deactivated. The options in the SXPG frameworks generally cover all requirements when calling operating system statements.

Example

Calls the operating system statement ping for the central database server of the system on the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance using the addition FILTER of the statement OPEN DATASET. The output of the operating system statement is written to the opened file and can be read from there.

ABAP and Operating System Statements

Operating system statements or system commands execute statements or programs directly on the operating system of the host computer of an AS instance or of a presentation server. Executing operating system statements from ABAP programs should be the exception not the rule, however it may become necessary in system or administration programs to call operating system functions that cannot be accessed by ABAP statements. In certain circumstances, input from external sources may need to be passed to the operating system.

-   [Operating System Statements of the Host Computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl.htm)

-   [Operating System Statements of the Presentation Server](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_pres.htm)

Security Hint

Using input from external sources in operating system statements incurs the risk of [system command injections](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abensys_comm_injections_scrty.htm).

SXPG Framework for Operating System Statements

The only recommended method for executing operating system statements from ABAP on the operating system of the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance or another server is to use the SXPG framework. This framework is based on a list of allowed operating system statements that can be called using function modules in the function pool SXPG.

The list of allowed operating system statements is defined by the system administrator in transaction SM69. Here, the platform-dependent physical operating system statements are assigned to a logical command name used to address them in ABAP. When one of these logical command names is passed to one of the function modules listed below, the operating system statement appropriate for the platform in question is executed. Logical command names assigned to an operating system command used by all platforms can be flagged with the operating system ANYOS. Static parameters can be assigned to any operating system statement and further parameters can be specified for when the statement is called. When an operating system statement is called using a logical command name, implicit authorization checks are performed, accompanied by extra self-defined checks. SAP provides a range of predefined logical command names with the type SAP. Logical command names created by customers have the type KUNDE.

If they have the right authorizations, developers can view the list of operating system statements in transaction SM49 and execute them from here. The following function modules can be called from ABAP programs:

-   SXPG\_CALL\_SYSTEM for execution on the host computer of the current AS instance

-   SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE for execution on other servers; the result can caught, but this is not mandatory

-   SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE\_LONG, like SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE but with a longer list of parameters

These function modules can also be called remotely.

Hint

For more information, see the Documentation Programming with External Commands in SAP Help Portal.

Example

Calls the operating system statement ping for the central database server of the system on the host computer of the current AS instance using the logical command name PING defined by SAP. The result of the call is passed to the internal table result. The function module SXPG\_CALL\_SYSTEM can raise more specific exceptions than those handled explicitly here.

Unwanted Calls of Operating System Statements

Alongside calls of function modules in the [SXPG framework](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm), operating system statements for the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance can be executed in ABAP programs as follows:

-   The addition [FILTER](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_os_addition.htm) of the statement [OPEN DATASET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset.htm) used for executing operating system statements using pipes.

-   The internal statement [CALL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall-.htm) used to call a special system function (SYSTEM), which can be used to execute operating system statements.

Neither of these options should be used for common execution of operating system statements in ABAP programs.

-   The addition [FILTER](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_os_addition.htm) of [OPEN DATASET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset.htm) should only be used (if at all) for operating system statements required for data handling.

-   Calls of the system function SYSTEM with the internal statement [CALL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall-.htm) should never be made and can be deactivated using the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") rdisp/call\_system. If called, it then raises an uncatchable exception.

Both statements cause the following problems:

-   There are no central authorization checks.

-   The platform dependency of the operating system statements must be handled in the ABAP program itself.

-   Errors and exceptions cannot be handled specifically.

-   If input from external sources is used, it must be checked thoroughly and filtered to prevent [system command injections](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abensys_comm_injections_scrty.htm) on any platform.

If possible, the [SXPG framework](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm) should be used instead of these two options.

Hint

Before the statements CALL 'SYSTEM' is deactivated using the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") rdisp/call\_system, it must be ensured that it is no longer used in any programs. Any programs that still use CALL 'SYSTEM' must first be switched to use of the [SXPG frameworks](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm) before the unwanted statement can be deactivated. The options in the SXPG frameworks generally cover all requirements when calling operating system statements.

Example

Calls the operating system statement ping for the central database server of the system on the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance using the addition FILTER of the statement OPEN DATASET.

ABAP and Operating System Statements

Operating system statements or system commands execute statements or programs directly on the operating system of the host computer of an AS instance or of a presentation server. Executing operating system statements from ABAP programs should be the exception not the rule, however it may become necessary in system or administration programs to call operating system functions that cannot be accessed by ABAP statements. In certain circumstances, input from external sources may need to be passed to the operating system.

-   [Operating System Statements of the Host Computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl.htm)

-   [Operating System Statements of the Presentation Server](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_pres.htm)

Security Hint

Using input from external sources in operating system statements incurs the risk of [system command injections](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abensys_comm_injections_scrty.htm).

SXPG Framework for Operating System Statements

The only recommended method for executing operating system statements from ABAP on the operating system of the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance or another server is to use the SXPG framework. This framework is based on a list of allowed operating system statements that can be called using function modules in the function pool SXPG.

The list of allowed operating system statements is defined by the system administrator in transaction SM69. Here, the platform-dependent physical operating system statements are assigned to a logical command name used to address them in ABAP. When one of these logical command names is passed to one of the function modules listed below, the operating system statement appropriate for the platform in question is executed. Logical command names assigned to an operating system command used by all platforms can be flagged with the operating system ANYOS. Static parameters can be assigned to any operating system statement and further parameters can be specified for when the statement is called. When an operating system statement is called using a logical command name, implicit authorization checks are performed, accompanied by extra self-defined checks. SAP provides a range of predefined logical command names with the type SAP. Logical command names created by customers have the type KUNDE.

If they have the right authorizations, developers can view the list of operating system statements in transaction SM49 and execute them from here. The following function modules can be called from ABAP programs:

-   SXPG\_CALL\_SYSTEM for execution on the host computer of the current AS instance

-   SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE for execution on other servers; the result can caught, but this is not mandatory

-   SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE\_LONG, like SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE but with a longer list of parameters

These function modules can also be called remotely.

Hint

For more information, see the Documentation Programming with External Commands in SAP Help Portal.

Example

Calls the operating system statement ping for the central database server of the system on the host computer of the current AS instance using the logical command name PING defined by SAP. The result of the call is passed to the internal table result. The function module SXPG\_CALL\_SYSTEM can raise more specific exceptions than those handled explicitly here.

Unwanted Calls of Operating System Statements

Alongside calls of function modules in the [SXPG framework](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm), operating system statements for the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance can be executed in ABAP programs as follows:

-   The addition [FILTER](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_os_addition.htm) of the statement [OPEN DATASET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset.htm) used for executing operating system statements using pipes.

-   The internal statement [CALL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall-.htm) used to call a special system function (SYSTEM), which can be used to execute operating system statements.

Neither of these options should be used for common execution of operating system statements in ABAP programs.

-   The addition [FILTER](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_os_addition.htm) of [OPEN DATASET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset.htm) should only be used (if at all) for operating system statements required for data handling.

-   Calls of the system function SYSTEM with the internal statement [CALL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall-.htm) should never be made and can be deactivated using the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") rdisp/call\_system. If called, it then raises an uncatchable exception.

Both statements cause the following problems:

-   There are no central authorization checks.

-   The platform dependency of the operating system statements must be handled in the ABAP program itself.

-   Errors and exceptions cannot be handled specifically.

-   If input from external sources is used, it must be checked thoroughly and filtered to prevent [system command injections](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abensys_comm_injections_scrty.htm) on any platform.

If possible, the [SXPG framework](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm) should be used instead of these two options.

Hint

Before the statements CALL 'SYSTEM' is deactivated using the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") rdisp/call\_system, it must be ensured that it is no longer used in any programs. Any programs that still use CALL 'SYSTEM' must first be switched to use of the [SXPG frameworks](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm) before the unwanted statement can be deactivated. The options in the SXPG frameworks generally cover all requirements when calling operating system statements.

Example

Calls the operating system statement ping for the central database server of the system on the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance using the addition FILTER of the statement OPEN DATASET. The output of the operating system statement is written to the opened file and can be read from there.

DATA dbserver TYPE c LENGTH 255.
CALL 'C\_SAPGPARAM' ID 'NAME'¬†¬†FIELD 'SAPDBHOST'
¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ID 'VALUE' FIELD¬†¬†dbserver.

The result of the call is passed to the internal table result. This example can only be executed if the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") rdisp/call\_system allows the call.

Operating System Statements of the Presentation Server

The method EXECUTE of the class [CL\_GUI\_FRONTEND\_SERVICES](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenfrontend_services.htm) can be used to call operating system statements of the presentation server. To make this possible, however, the current ABAP program must be executed in [dialog](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendialog_processing_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and from SAP GUI.

ABAP and Operating System Statements

Operating system statements or system commands execute statements or programs directly on the operating system of the host computer of an AS instance or of a presentation server. Executing operating system statements from ABAP programs should be the exception not the rule, however it may become necessary in system or administration programs to call operating system functions that cannot be accessed by ABAP statements. In certain circumstances, input from external sources may need to be passed to the operating system.

-   [Operating System Statements of the Presentation Server](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_pres.htm)

Security Hint

Using input from external sources in operating system statements incurs the risk of [system command injections](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abensys_comm_injections_scrty.htm).

SXPG Framework for Operating System Statements

The only recommended method for executing operating system statements from ABAP on the operating system of the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance or another server is to use the SXPG framework. This framework is based on a list of allowed operating system statements that can be called using function modules in the function pool SXPG.

The list of allowed operating system statements is defined by the system administrator in transaction SM69. Here, the platform-dependent physical operating system statements are assigned to a logical command name used to address them in ABAP. When one of these logical command names is passed to one of the function modules listed below, the operating system statement appropriate for the platform in question is executed. Logical command names assigned to an operating system command used by all platforms can be flagged with the operating system ANYOS. Static parameters can be assigned to any operating system statement and further parameters can be specified for when the statement is called. When an operating system statement is called using a logical command name, implicit authorization checks are performed, accompanied by extra self-defined checks. SAP provides a range of predefined logical command names with the type SAP. Logical command names created by customers have the type KUNDE.

If they have the right authorizations, developers can view the list of operating system statements in transaction SM49 and execute them from here. The following function modules can be called from ABAP programs:

-   SXPG\_CALL\_SYSTEM for execution on the host computer of the current AS instance

-   SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE for execution on other servers; the result can caught, but this is not mandatory

-   SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE\_LONG, like SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE but with a longer list of parameters

These function modules can also be called remotely.

Hint

For more information, see the Documentation Programming with External Commands in SAP Help Portal.

Example

Calls the operating system statement ping for the central database server of the system on the host computer of the current AS instance using the logical command name PING defined by SAP. The result of the call is passed to the internal table result. The function module SXPG\_CALL\_SYSTEM can raise more specific exceptions than those handled explicitly here.

Unwanted Calls of Operating System Statements

Alongside calls of function modules in the [SXPG framework](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm), operating system statements for the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance can be executed in ABAP programs as follows:

-   The addition [FILTER](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_os_addition.htm) of the statement [OPEN DATASET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset.htm) used for executing operating system statements using pipes.

-   The internal statement [CALL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall-.htm) used to call a special system function (SYSTEM), which can be used to execute operating system statements.

Neither of these options should be used for common execution of operating system statements in ABAP programs.

-   The addition [FILTER](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_os_addition.htm) of [OPEN DATASET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset.htm) should only be used (if at all) for operating system statements required for data handling.

-   Calls of the system function SYSTEM with the internal statement [CALL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall-.htm) should never be made and can be deactivated using the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") rdisp/call\_system. If called, it then raises an uncatchable exception.

Both statements cause the following problems:

-   There are no central authorization checks.

-   The platform dependency of the operating system statements must be handled in the ABAP program itself.

-   Errors and exceptions cannot be handled specifically.

-   If input from external sources is used, it must be checked thoroughly and filtered to prevent [system command injections](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abensys_comm_injections_scrty.htm) on any platform.

If possible, the [SXPG framework](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm) should be used instead of these two options.

Hint

Before the statements CALL 'SYSTEM' is deactivated using the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") rdisp/call\_system, it must be ensured that it is no longer used in any programs. Any programs that still use CALL 'SYSTEM' must first be switched to use of the [SXPG frameworks](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm) before the unwanted statement can be deactivated. The options in the SXPG frameworks generally cover all requirements when calling operating system statements.

Example

Calls the operating system statement ping for the central database server of the system on the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance using the addition FILTER of the statement OPEN DATASET. The output of the operating system statement is written to the opened file and can be read from there.

DATA dbserver TYPE c LENGTH 255.

The result of the call is passed to the internal table result. This example can only be executed if the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") rdisp/call\_system allows the call.

ABAP and Operating System Statements

Operating system statements or system commands execute statements or programs directly on the operating system of the host computer of an AS instance or of a presentation server. Executing operating system statements from ABAP programs should be the exception not the rule, however it may become necessary in system or administration programs to call operating system functions that cannot be accessed by ABAP statements. In certain circumstances, input from external sources may need to be passed to the operating system.

SXPG Framework for Operating System Statements

The only recommended method for executing operating system statements from ABAP on the operating system of the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance or another server is to use the SXPG framework. This framework is based on a list of allowed operating system statements that can be called using function modules in the function pool SXPG.

The list of allowed operating system statements is defined by the system administrator in transaction SM69. Here, the platform-dependent physical operating system statements are assigned to a logical command name used to address them in ABAP. When one of these logical command names is passed to one of the function modules listed below, the operating system statement appropriate for the platform in question is executed. Logical command names assigned to an operating system command used by all platforms can be flagged with the operating system ANYOS. Static parameters can be assigned to any operating system statement and further parameters can be specified for when the statement is called. When an operating system statement is called using a logical command name, implicit authorization checks are performed, accompanied by extra self-defined checks. SAP provides a range of predefined logical command names with the type SAP. Logical command names created by customers have the type KUNDE.

If they have the right authorizations, developers can view the list of operating system statements in transaction SM49 and execute them from here. The following function modules can be called from ABAP programs:

-   SXPG\_CALL\_SYSTEM for execution on the host computer of the current AS instance

-   SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE for execution on other servers; the result can caught, but this is not mandatory

-   SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE\_LONG, like SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE but with a longer list of parameters

These function modules can also be called remotely.

Hint

For more information, see the Documentation Programming with External Commands in SAP Help Portal.

Example

Calls the operating system statement ping for the central database server of the system on the host computer of the current AS instance using the logical command name PING defined by SAP. The result of the call is passed to the internal table result. The function module SXPG\_CALL\_SYSTEM can raise more specific exceptions than those handled explicitly here.

Unwanted Calls of Operating System Statements

Alongside calls of function modules in the [SXPG framework](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm), operating system statements for the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance can be executed in ABAP programs as follows:

-   The addition [FILTER](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_os_addition.htm) of the statement [OPEN DATASET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset.htm) used for executing operating system statements using pipes.

-   The internal statement [CALL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall-.htm) used to call a special system function (SYSTEM), which can be used to execute operating system statements.

Neither of these options should be used for common execution of operating system statements in ABAP programs.

-   The addition [FILTER](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_os_addition.htm) of [OPEN DATASET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset.htm) should only be used (if at all) for operating system statements required for data handling.

-   Calls of the system function SYSTEM with the internal statement [CALL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall-.htm) should never be made and can be deactivated using the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") rdisp/call\_system. If called, it then raises an uncatchable exception.

Both statements cause the following problems:

-   There are no central authorization checks.

-   The platform dependency of the operating system statements must be handled in the ABAP program itself.

-   Errors and exceptions cannot be handled specifically.

-   If input from external sources is used, it must be checked thoroughly and filtered to prevent [system command injections](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abensys_comm_injections_scrty.htm) on any platform.

If possible, the [SXPG framework](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm) should be used instead of these two options.

Hint

Before the statements CALL 'SYSTEM' is deactivated using the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") rdisp/call\_system, it must be ensured that it is no longer used in any programs. Any programs that still use CALL 'SYSTEM' must first be switched to use of the [SXPG frameworks](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm) before the unwanted statement can be deactivated. The options in the SXPG frameworks generally cover all requirements when calling operating system statements.

Example

Calls the operating system statement ping for the central database server of the system on the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance using the addition FILTER of the statement OPEN DATASET. The output of the operating system statement is written to the opened file and can be read from there.

DATA dbserver TYPE c LENGTH 255.
CALL 'C\_SAPGPARAM' ID 'NAME'¬†¬†FIELD 'SAPDBHOST'
¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ID 'VALUE' FIELD¬†¬†dbserver.

The result of the call is passed to the internal table result. This example can only be executed if the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") rdisp/call\_system allows the call.

SXPG Framework for Operating System Statements

The only recommended method for executing operating system statements from ABAP on the operating system of the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance or another server is to use the SXPG framework. This framework is based on a list of allowed operating system statements that can be called using function modules in the function pool SXPG.

The list of allowed operating system statements is defined by the system administrator in transaction SM69. Here, the platform-dependent physical operating system statements are assigned to a logical command name used to address them in ABAP. When one of these logical command names is passed to one of the function modules listed below, the operating system statement appropriate for the platform in question is executed. Logical command names assigned to an operating system command used by all platforms can be flagged with the operating system ANYOS. Static parameters can be assigned to any operating system statement and further parameters can be specified for when the statement is called. When an operating system statement is called using a logical command name, implicit authorization checks are performed, accompanied by extra self-defined checks. SAP provides a range of predefined logical command names with the type SAP. Logical command names created by customers have the type KUNDE.

If they have the right authorizations, developers can view the list of operating system statements in transaction SM49 and execute them from here. The following function modules can be called from ABAP programs:

-   SXPG\_CALL\_SYSTEM for execution on the host computer of the current AS instance

-   SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE for execution on other servers; the result can caught, but this is not mandatory

-   SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE\_LONG, like SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE but with a longer list of parameters

These function modules can also be called remotely.

Hint

For more information, see the Documentation Programming with External Commands in SAP Help Portal.

Example

Calls the operating system statement ping for the central database server of the system on the host computer of the current AS instance using the logical command name PING defined by SAP. The result of the call is passed to the internal table result. The function module SXPG\_CALL\_SYSTEM can raise more specific exceptions than those handled explicitly here.

Unwanted Calls of Operating System Statements

Alongside calls of function modules in the [SXPG framework](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm), operating system statements for the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance can be executed in ABAP programs as follows:

-   The addition [FILTER](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_os_addition.htm) of the statement [OPEN DATASET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset.htm) used for executing operating system statements using pipes.

-   The internal statement [CALL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall-.htm) used to call a special system function (SYSTEM), which can be used to execute operating system statements.

Neither of these options should be used for common execution of operating system statements in ABAP programs.

-   The addition [FILTER](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_os_addition.htm) of [OPEN DATASET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset.htm) should only be used (if at all) for operating system statements required for data handling.

-   Calls of the system function SYSTEM with the internal statement [CALL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall-.htm) should never be made and can be deactivated using the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") rdisp/call\_system. If called, it then raises an uncatchable exception.

Both statements cause the following problems:

-   There are no central authorization checks.

-   The platform dependency of the operating system statements must be handled in the ABAP program itself.

-   Errors and exceptions cannot be handled specifically.

-   If input from external sources is used, it must be checked thoroughly and filtered to prevent [system command injections](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abensys_comm_injections_scrty.htm) on any platform.

If possible, the [SXPG framework](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm) should be used instead of these two options.

Hint

Before the statements CALL 'SYSTEM' is deactivated using the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") rdisp/call\_system, it must be ensured that it is no longer used in any programs. Any programs that still use CALL 'SYSTEM' must first be switched to use of the [SXPG frameworks](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm) before the unwanted statement can be deactivated. The options in the SXPG frameworks generally cover all requirements when calling operating system statements.

Example

Calls the operating system statement ping for the central database server of the system on the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance using the addition FILTER of the statement OPEN DATASET. The output of the operating system statement is written to the opened file and can be read from there.

DATA dbserver TYPE c LENGTH 255.

The result of the call is passed to the internal table result. This example can only be executed if the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") rdisp/call\_system allows the call.

ABAP and Operating System Statements

Operating system statements or system commands execute statements or programs directly on the operating system of the host computer of an AS instance or of a presentation server. Executing operating system statements from ABAP programs should be the exception not the rule, however it may become necessary in system or administration programs to call operating system functions that cannot be accessed by ABAP statements. In certain circumstances, input from external sources may need to be passed to the operating system.

SXPG Framework for Operating System Statements

The only recommended method for executing operating system statements from ABAP on the operating system of the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance or another server is to use the SXPG framework. This framework is based on a list of allowed operating system statements that can be called using function modules in the function pool SXPG.

The list of allowed operating system statements is defined by the system administrator in transaction SM69. Here, the platform-dependent physical operating system statements are assigned to a logical command name used to address them in ABAP. When one of these logical command names is passed to one of the function modules listed below, the operating system statement appropriate for the platform in question is executed. Logical command names assigned to an operating system command used by all platforms can be flagged with the operating system ANYOS. Static parameters can be assigned to any operating system statement and further parameters can be specified for when the statement is called. When an operating system statement is called using a logical command name, implicit authorization checks are performed, accompanied by extra self-defined checks. SAP provides a range of predefined logical command names with the type SAP. Logical command names created by customers have the type KUNDE.

If they have the right authorizations, developers can view the list of operating system statements in transaction SM49 and execute them from here. The following function modules can be called from ABAP programs:

-   SXPG\_CALL\_SYSTEM for execution on the host computer of the current AS instance

-   SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE for execution on other servers; the result can caught, but this is not mandatory

-   SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE\_LONG, like SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE but with a longer list of parameters

These function modules can also be called remotely.

Hint

For more information, see the Documentation Programming with External Commands in SAP Help Portal.

Example

Calls the operating system statement ping for the central database server of the system on the host computer of the current AS instance using the logical command name PING defined by SAP. The result of the call is passed to the internal table result. The function module SXPG\_CALL\_SYSTEM can raise more specific exceptions than those handled explicitly here.

Unwanted Calls of Operating System Statements

Alongside calls of function modules in the [SXPG framework](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm), operating system statements for the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance can be executed in ABAP programs as follows:

-   The addition [FILTER](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_os_addition.htm) of the statement [OPEN DATASET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset.htm) used for executing operating system statements using pipes.

-   The internal statement [CALL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall-.htm) used to call a special system function (SYSTEM), which can be used to execute operating system statements.

Neither of these options should be used for common execution of operating system statements in ABAP programs.

-   The addition [FILTER](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_os_addition.htm) of [OPEN DATASET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset.htm) should only be used (if at all) for operating system statements required for data handling.

-   Calls of the system function SYSTEM with the internal statement [CALL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall-.htm) should never be made and can be deactivated using the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") rdisp/call\_system. If called, it then raises an uncatchable exception.

Both statements cause the following problems:

-   There are no central authorization checks.

-   The platform dependency of the operating system statements must be handled in the ABAP program itself.

-   Errors and exceptions cannot be handled specifically.

-   If input from external sources is used, it must be checked thoroughly and filtered to prevent [system command injections](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abensys_comm_injections_scrty.htm) on any platform.

If possible, the [SXPG framework](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm) should be used instead of these two options.

Hint

Before the statements CALL 'SYSTEM' is deactivated using the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") rdisp/call\_system, it must be ensured that it is no longer used in any programs. Any programs that still use CALL 'SYSTEM' must first be switched to use of the [SXPG frameworks](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm) before the unwanted statement can be deactivated. The options in the SXPG frameworks generally cover all requirements when calling operating system statements.

Example

Calls the operating system statement ping for the central database server of the system on the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance using the addition FILTER of the statement OPEN DATASET. The output of the operating system statement is written to the opened file and can be read from there.

DATA dbserver TYPE c LENGTH 255.

The result of the call is passed to the internal table result. This example can only be executed if the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") rdisp/call\_system allows the call.

ABAP and Operating System Statements

Operating system statements or system commands execute statements or programs directly on the operating system of the host computer of an AS instance or of a presentation server. Executing operating system statements from ABAP programs should be the exception not the rule, however it may become necessary in system or administration programs to call operating system functions that cannot be accessed by ABAP statements. In certain circumstances, input from external sources may need to be passed to the operating system.

-   [Operating System Statements of the Host Computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl.htm)

-   [Operating System Statements of the Presentation Server](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_pres.htm)

Security Hint

Using input from external sources in operating system statements incurs the risk of [system command injections](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abensys_comm_injections_scrty.htm).

SXPG Framework for Operating System Statements

The only recommended method for executing operating system statements from ABAP on the operating system of the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance or another server is to use the SXPG framework. This framework is based on a list of allowed operating system statements that can be called using function modules in the function pool SXPG.

The list of allowed operating system statements is defined by the system administrator in transaction SM69. Here, the platform-dependent physical operating system statements are assigned to a logical command name used to address them in ABAP. When one of these logical command names is passed to one of the function modules listed below, the operating system statement appropriate for the platform in question is executed. Logical command names assigned to an operating system command used by all platforms can be flagged with the operating system ANYOS. Static parameters can be assigned to any operating system statement and further parameters can be specified for when the statement is called. When an operating system statement is called using a logical command name, implicit authorization checks are performed, accompanied by extra self-defined checks. SAP provides a range of predefined logical command names with the type SAP. Logical command names created by customers have the type KUNDE.

If they have the right authorizations, developers can view the list of operating system statements in transaction SM49 and execute them from here. The following function modules can be called from ABAP programs:

-   SXPG\_CALL\_SYSTEM for execution on the host computer of the current AS instance

-   SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE for execution on other servers; the result can caught, but this is not mandatory

-   SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE\_LONG, like SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE but with a longer list of parameters

These function modules can also be called remotely.

Hint

For more information, see the Documentation Programming with External Commands in SAP Help Portal.

Example

Calls the operating system statement ping for the central database server of the system on the host computer of the current AS instance using the logical command name PING defined by SAP. The result of the call is passed to the internal table result. The function module SXPG\_CALL\_SYSTEM can raise more specific exceptions than those handled explicitly here.

Unwanted Calls of Operating System Statements

Alongside calls of function modules in the [SXPG framework](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm), operating system statements for the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance can be executed in ABAP programs as follows:

-   The addition [FILTER](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_os_addition.htm) of the statement [OPEN DATASET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset.htm) used for executing operating system statements using pipes.

-   The internal statement [CALL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall-.htm) used to call a special system function (SYSTEM), which can be used to execute operating system statements.

Neither of these options should be used for common execution of operating system statements in ABAP programs.

-   The addition [FILTER](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_os_addition.htm) of [OPEN DATASET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset.htm) should only be used (if at all) for operating system statements required for data handling.

-   Calls of the system function SYSTEM with the internal statement [CALL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall-.htm) should never be made and can be deactivated using the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") rdisp/call\_system. If called, it then raises an uncatchable exception.

Both statements cause the following problems:

-   There are no central authorization checks.

-   The platform dependency of the operating system statements must be handled in the ABAP program itself.

-   Errors and exceptions cannot be handled specifically.

-   If input from external sources is used, it must be checked thoroughly and filtered to prevent [system command injections](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abensys_comm_injections_scrty.htm) on any platform.

If possible, the [SXPG framework](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm) should be used instead of these two options.

Hint

Before the statements CALL 'SYSTEM' is deactivated using the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") rdisp/call\_system, it must be ensured that it is no longer used in any programs. Any programs that still use CALL 'SYSTEM' must first be switched to use of the [SXPG frameworks](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm) before the unwanted statement can be deactivated. The options in the SXPG frameworks generally cover all requirements when calling operating system statements.

Example

Calls the operating system statement ping for the central database server of the system on the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance using the addition FILTER of the statement OPEN DATASET. The output of the operating system statement is written to the opened file and can be read from there.

DATA dbserver TYPE c LENGTH 255.

The result of the call is passed to the internal table result. This example can only be executed if the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") rdisp/call\_system allows the call.

ABAP and Operating System Statements

Operating system statements or system commands execute statements or programs directly on the operating system of the host computer of an AS instance or of a presentation server. Executing operating system statements from ABAP programs should be the exception not the rule, however it may become necessary in system or administration programs to call operating system functions that cannot be accessed by ABAP statements. In certain circumstances, input from external sources may need to be passed to the operating system.

-   [Operating System Statements of the Host Computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl.htm)

-   [Operating System Statements of the Presentation Server](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_pres.htm)

Security Hint

Using input from external sources in operating system statements incurs the risk of [system command injections](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abensys_comm_injections_scrty.htm).

SXPG Framework for Operating System Statements

The only recommended method for executing operating system statements from ABAP on the operating system of the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance or another server is to use the SXPG framework. This framework is based on a list of allowed operating system statements that can be called using function modules in the function pool SXPG.

The list of allowed operating system statements is defined by the system administrator in transaction SM69. Here, the platform-dependent physical operating system statements are assigned to a logical command name used to address them in ABAP. When one of these logical command names is passed to one of the function modules listed below, the operating system statement appropriate for the platform in question is executed. Logical command names assigned to an operating system command used by all platforms can be flagged with the operating system ANYOS. Static parameters can be assigned to any operating system statement and further parameters can be specified for when the statement is called. When an operating system statement is called using a logical command name, implicit authorization checks are performed, accompanied by extra self-defined checks. SAP provides a range of predefined logical command names with the type SAP. Logical command names created by customers have the type KUNDE.

If they have the right authorizations, developers can view the list of operating system statements in transaction SM49 and execute them from here. The following function modules can be called from ABAP programs:

-   SXPG\_CALL\_SYSTEM for execution on the host computer of the current AS instance

-   SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE for execution on other servers; the result can caught, but this is not mandatory

-   SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE\_LONG, like SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE but with a longer list of parameters

These function modules can also be called remotely.

Hint

For more information, see the Documentation Programming with External Commands in SAP Help Portal.

Example

Calls the operating system statement ping for the central database server of the system on the host computer of the current AS instance using the logical command name PING defined by SAP. The result of the call is passed to the internal table result. The function module SXPG\_CALL\_SYSTEM can raise more specific exceptions than those handled explicitly here.

Unwanted Calls of Operating System Statements

Alongside calls of function modules in the [SXPG framework](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm), operating system statements for the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance can be executed in ABAP programs as follows:

-   The addition [FILTER](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_os_addition.htm) of the statement [OPEN DATASET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset.htm) used for executing operating system statements using pipes.

-   The internal statement [CALL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall-.htm) used to call a special system function (SYSTEM), which can be used to execute operating system statements.

Neither of these options should be used for common execution of operating system statements in ABAP programs.

-   The addition [FILTER](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_os_addition.htm) of [OPEN DATASET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset.htm) should only be used (if at all) for operating system statements required for data handling.

-   Calls of the system function SYSTEM with the internal statement [CALL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall-.htm) should never be made and can be deactivated using the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") rdisp/call\_system. If called, it then raises an uncatchable exception.

Both statements cause the following problems:

-   There are no central authorization checks.

-   The platform dependency of the operating system statements must be handled in the ABAP program itself.

-   Errors and exceptions cannot be handled specifically.

-   If input from external sources is used, it must be checked thoroughly and filtered to prevent [system command injections](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abensys_comm_injections_scrty.htm) on any platform.

If possible, the [SXPG framework](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm) should be used instead of these two options.

Hint

Before the statements CALL 'SYSTEM' is deactivated using the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") rdisp/call\_system, it must be ensured that it is no longer used in any programs. Any programs that still use CALL 'SYSTEM' must first be switched to use of the [SXPG frameworks](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm) before the unwanted statement can be deactivated. The options in the SXPG frameworks generally cover all requirements when calling operating system statements.

Example

Calls the operating system statement ping for the central database server of the system on the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance using the addition FILTER of the statement OPEN DATASET. The output of the operating system statement is written to the opened file and can be read from there.

DATA dbserver TYPE c LENGTH 255.
CALL 'C\_SAPGPARAM' ID 'NAME'¬†¬†FIELD 'SAPDBHOST'
¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ID 'VALUE' FIELD¬†¬†dbserver.

The result of the call is passed to the internal table result. This example can only be executed if the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") rdisp/call\_system allows the call.

Operating System Statements of the Presentation Server

The method EXECUTE of the class [CL\_GUI\_FRONTEND\_SERVICES](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenfrontend_services.htm) can be used to call operating system statements of the presentation server. To make this possible, however, the current ABAP program must be executed in [dialog](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendialog_processing_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and from SAP GUI.

Hint

The method EXECUTE of the class CL\_GUI\_FRONTEND\_SERVICES replaces the obsolete function module WS\_EXECUTE.

ABAP and Operating System Statements

Operating system statements or system commands execute statements or programs directly on the operating system of the host computer of an AS instance or of a presentation server. Executing operating system statements from ABAP programs should be the exception not the rule, however it may become necessary in system or administration programs to call operating system functions that cannot be accessed by ABAP statements. In certain circumstances, input from external sources may need to be passed to the operating system.

-   [Operating System Statements of the Host Computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl.htm)

-   [Operating System Statements of the Presentation Server](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_pres.htm)

Security Hint

Using input from external sources in operating system statements incurs the risk of [system command injections](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abensys_comm_injections_scrty.htm).

SXPG Framework for Operating System Statements

The only recommended method for executing operating system statements from ABAP on the operating system of the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance or another server is to use the SXPG framework. This framework is based on a list of allowed operating system statements that can be called using function modules in the function pool SXPG.

The list of allowed operating system statements is defined by the system administrator in transaction SM69. Here, the platform-dependent physical operating system statements are assigned to a logical command name used to address them in ABAP. When one of these logical command names is passed to one of the function modules listed below, the operating system statement appropriate for the platform in question is executed. Logical command names assigned to an operating system command used by all platforms can be flagged with the operating system ANYOS. Static parameters can be assigned to any operating system statement and further parameters can be specified for when the statement is called. When an operating system statement is called using a logical command name, implicit authorization checks are performed, accompanied by extra self-defined checks. SAP provides a range of predefined logical command names with the type SAP. Logical command names created by customers have the type KUNDE.

If they have the right authorizations, developers can view the list of operating system statements in transaction SM49 and execute them from here. The following function modules can be called from ABAP programs:

-   SXPG\_CALL\_SYSTEM for execution on the host computer of the current AS instance

-   SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE for execution on other servers; the result can caught, but this is not mandatory

-   SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE\_LONG, like SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE but with a longer list of parameters

These function modules can also be called remotely.

Hint

For more information, see the Documentation Programming with External Commands in SAP Help Portal.

Example

Calls the operating system statement ping for the central database server of the system on the host computer of the current AS instance using the logical command name PING defined by SAP. The result of the call is passed to the internal table result. The function module SXPG\_CALL\_SYSTEM can raise more specific exceptions than those handled explicitly here.

Unwanted Calls of Operating System Statements

Alongside calls of function modules in the [SXPG framework](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm), operating system statements for the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance can be executed in ABAP programs as follows:

-   The addition [FILTER](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_os_addition.htm) of the statement [OPEN DATASET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset.htm) used for executing operating system statements using pipes.

-   The internal statement [CALL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall-.htm) used to call a special system function (SYSTEM), which can be used to execute operating system statements.

Neither of these options should be used for common execution of operating system statements in ABAP programs.

-   The addition [FILTER](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_os_addition.htm) of [OPEN DATASET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset.htm) should only be used (if at all) for operating system statements required for data handling.

-   Calls of the system function SYSTEM with the internal statement [CALL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall-.htm) should never be made and can be deactivated using the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") rdisp/call\_system. If called, it then raises an uncatchable exception.

Both statements cause the following problems:

-   There are no central authorization checks.

-   The platform dependency of the operating system statements must be handled in the ABAP program itself.

-   Errors and exceptions cannot be handled specifically.

-   If input from external sources is used, it must be checked thoroughly and filtered to prevent [system command injections](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abensys_comm_injections_scrty.htm) on any platform.

If possible, the [SXPG framework](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm) should be used instead of these two options.

Hint

Before the statements CALL 'SYSTEM' is deactivated using the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") rdisp/call\_system, it must be ensured that it is no longer used in any programs. Any programs that still use CALL 'SYSTEM' must first be switched to use of the [SXPG frameworks](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm) before the unwanted statement can be deactivated. The options in the SXPG frameworks generally cover all requirements when calling operating system statements.

Example

Calls the operating system statement ping for the central database server of the system on the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance using the addition FILTER of the statement OPEN DATASET. The output of the operating system statement is written to the opened file and can be read from there.

ABAP and Operating System Statements

Operating system statements or system commands execute statements or programs directly on the operating system of the host computer of an AS instance or of a presentation server. Executing operating system statements from ABAP programs should be the exception not the rule, however it may become necessary in system or administration programs to call operating system functions that cannot be accessed by ABAP statements. In certain circumstances, input from external sources may need to be passed to the operating system.

-   [Operating System Statements of the Host Computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl.htm)

-   [Operating System Statements of the Presentation Server](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_pres.htm)

Security Hint

Using input from external sources in operating system statements incurs the risk of [system command injections](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abensys_comm_injections_scrty.htm).

SXPG Framework for Operating System Statements

The only recommended method for executing operating system statements from ABAP on the operating system of the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance or another server is to use the SXPG framework. This framework is based on a list of allowed operating system statements that can be called using function modules in the function pool SXPG.

The list of allowed operating system statements is defined by the system administrator in transaction SM69. Here, the platform-dependent physical operating system statements are assigned to a logical command name used to address them in ABAP. When one of these logical command names is passed to one of the function modules listed below, the operating system statement appropriate for the platform in question is executed. Logical command names assigned to an operating system command used by all platforms can be flagged with the operating system ANYOS. Static parameters can be assigned to any operating system statement and further parameters can be specified for when the statement is called. When an operating system statement is called using a logical command name, implicit authorization checks are performed, accompanied by extra self-defined checks. SAP provides a range of predefined logical command names with the type SAP. Logical command names created by customers have the type KUNDE.

If they have the right authorizations, developers can view the list of operating system statements in transaction SM49 and execute them from here. The following function modules can be called from ABAP programs:

-   SXPG\_CALL\_SYSTEM for execution on the host computer of the current AS instance

-   SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE for execution on other servers; the result can caught, but this is not mandatory

-   SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE\_LONG, like SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE but with a longer list of parameters

These function modules can also be called remotely.

Hint

For more information, see the Documentation Programming with External Commands in SAP Help Portal.

Example

Calls the operating system statement ping for the central database server of the system on the host computer of the current AS instance using the logical command name PING defined by SAP. The result of the call is passed to the internal table result. The function module SXPG\_CALL\_SYSTEM can raise more specific exceptions than those handled explicitly here.

Unwanted Calls of Operating System Statements

Alongside calls of function modules in the [SXPG framework](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm), operating system statements for the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance can be executed in ABAP programs as follows:

-   The addition [FILTER](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_os_addition.htm) of the statement [OPEN DATASET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset.htm) used for executing operating system statements using pipes.

-   The internal statement [CALL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall-.htm) used to call a special system function (SYSTEM), which can be used to execute operating system statements.

Neither of these options should be used for common execution of operating system statements in ABAP programs.

-   The addition [FILTER](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_os_addition.htm) of [OPEN DATASET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset.htm) should only be used (if at all) for operating system statements required for data handling.

-   Calls of the system function SYSTEM with the internal statement [CALL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall-.htm) should never be made and can be deactivated using the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") rdisp/call\_system. If called, it then raises an uncatchable exception.

Both statements cause the following problems:

-   There are no central authorization checks.

-   The platform dependency of the operating system statements must be handled in the ABAP program itself.

-   Errors and exceptions cannot be handled specifically.

-   If input from external sources is used, it must be checked thoroughly and filtered to prevent [system command injections](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abensys_comm_injections_scrty.htm) on any platform.

If possible, the [SXPG framework](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm) should be used instead of these two options.

Hint

Before the statements CALL 'SYSTEM' is deactivated using the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") rdisp/call\_system, it must be ensured that it is no longer used in any programs. Any programs that still use CALL 'SYSTEM' must first be switched to use of the [SXPG frameworks](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm) before the unwanted statement can be deactivated. The options in the SXPG frameworks generally cover all requirements when calling operating system statements.

Example

Calls the operating system statement ping for the central database server of the system on the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance using the addition FILTER of the statement OPEN DATASET.

ABAP and Operating System Statements

Operating system statements or system commands execute statements or programs directly on the operating system of the host computer of an AS instance or of a presentation server. Executing operating system statements from ABAP programs should be the exception not the rule, however it may become necessary in system or administration programs to call operating system functions that cannot be accessed by ABAP statements. In certain circumstances, input from external sources may need to be passed to the operating system.

-   [Operating System Statements of the Host Computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl.htm)

-   [Operating System Statements of the Presentation Server](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_pres.htm)

Security Hint

Using input from external sources in operating system statements incurs the risk of [system command injections](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abensys_comm_injections_scrty.htm).

SXPG Framework for Operating System Statements

The only recommended method for executing operating system statements from ABAP on the operating system of the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance or another server is to use the SXPG framework. This framework is based on a list of allowed operating system statements that can be called using function modules in the function pool SXPG.

The list of allowed operating system statements is defined by the system administrator in transaction SM69. Here, the platform-dependent physical operating system statements are assigned to a logical command name used to address them in ABAP. When one of these logical command names is passed to one of the function modules listed below, the operating system statement appropriate for the platform in question is executed. Logical command names assigned to an operating system command used by all platforms can be flagged with the operating system ANYOS. Static parameters can be assigned to any operating system statement and further parameters can be specified for when the statement is called. When an operating system statement is called using a logical command name, implicit authorization checks are performed, accompanied by extra self-defined checks. SAP provides a range of predefined logical command names with the type SAP. Logical command names created by customers have the type KUNDE.

If they have the right authorizations, developers can view the list of operating system statements in transaction SM49 and execute them from here. The following function modules can be called from ABAP programs:

-   SXPG\_CALL\_SYSTEM for execution on the host computer of the current AS instance

-   SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE for execution on other servers; the result can caught, but this is not mandatory

-   SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE\_LONG, like SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE but with a longer list of parameters

These function modules can also be called remotely.

Hint

For more information, see the Documentation Programming with External Commands in SAP Help Portal.

Example

Calls the operating system statement ping for the central database server of the system on the host computer of the current AS instance using the logical command name PING defined by SAP. The result of the call is passed to the internal table result. The function module SXPG\_CALL\_SYSTEM can raise more specific exceptions than those handled explicitly here.

Unwanted Calls of Operating System Statements

Alongside calls of function modules in the [SXPG framework](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm), operating system statements for the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance can be executed in ABAP programs as follows:

-   The addition [FILTER](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_os_addition.htm) of the statement [OPEN DATASET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset.htm) used for executing operating system statements using pipes.

-   The internal statement [CALL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall-.htm) used to call a special system function (SYSTEM), which can be used to execute operating system statements.

Neither of these options should be used for common execution of operating system statements in ABAP programs.

-   The addition [FILTER](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_os_addition.htm) of [OPEN DATASET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset.htm) should only be used (if at all) for operating system statements required for data handling.

-   Calls of the system function SYSTEM with the internal statement [CALL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall-.htm) should never be made and can be deactivated using the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") rdisp/call\_system. If called, it then raises an uncatchable exception.

Both statements cause the following problems:

-   There are no central authorization checks.

-   The platform dependency of the operating system statements must be handled in the ABAP program itself.

-   Errors and exceptions cannot be handled specifically.

-   If input from external sources is used, it must be checked thoroughly and filtered to prevent [system command injections](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abensys_comm_injections_scrty.htm) on any platform.

If possible, the [SXPG framework](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm) should be used instead of these two options.

Hint

Before the statements CALL 'SYSTEM' is deactivated using the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") rdisp/call\_system, it must be ensured that it is no longer used in any programs. Any programs that still use CALL 'SYSTEM' must first be switched to use of the [SXPG frameworks](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm) before the unwanted statement can be deactivated. The options in the SXPG frameworks generally cover all requirements when calling operating system statements.

Example

Calls the operating system statement ping for the central database server of the system on the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance using the addition FILTER of the statement OPEN DATASET. The output of the operating system statement is written to the opened file and can be read from there.

DATA dbserver TYPE c LENGTH 255.
CALL 'C\_SAPGPARAM' ID 'NAME'¬†¬†FIELD 'SAPDBHOST'
¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ID 'VALUE' FIELD¬†¬†dbserver.

The result of the call is passed to the internal table result. This example can only be executed if the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") rdisp/call\_system allows the call.

ABAP and Operating System Statements

Operating system statements or system commands execute statements or programs directly on the operating system of the host computer of an AS instance or of a presentation server. Executing operating system statements from ABAP programs should be the exception not the rule, however it may become necessary in system or administration programs to call operating system functions that cannot be accessed by ABAP statements. In certain circumstances, input from external sources may need to be passed to the operating system.

-   [Operating System Statements of the Presentation Server](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_pres.htm)

Security Hint

Using input from external sources in operating system statements incurs the risk of [system command injections](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abensys_comm_injections_scrty.htm).

SXPG Framework for Operating System Statements

The only recommended method for executing operating system statements from ABAP on the operating system of the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance or another server is to use the SXPG framework. This framework is based on a list of allowed operating system statements that can be called using function modules in the function pool SXPG.

The list of allowed operating system statements is defined by the system administrator in transaction SM69. Here, the platform-dependent physical operating system statements are assigned to a logical command name used to address them in ABAP. When one of these logical command names is passed to one of the function modules listed below, the operating system statement appropriate for the platform in question is executed. Logical command names assigned to an operating system command used by all platforms can be flagged with the operating system ANYOS. Static parameters can be assigned to any operating system statement and further parameters can be specified for when the statement is called. When an operating system statement is called using a logical command name, implicit authorization checks are performed, accompanied by extra self-defined checks. SAP provides a range of predefined logical command names with the type SAP. Logical command names created by customers have the type KUNDE.

If they have the right authorizations, developers can view the list of operating system statements in transaction SM49 and execute them from here. The following function modules can be called from ABAP programs:

-   SXPG\_CALL\_SYSTEM for execution on the host computer of the current AS instance

-   SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE for execution on other servers; the result can caught, but this is not mandatory

-   SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE\_LONG, like SXPG\_COMMAND\_EXECUTE but with a longer list of parameters

These function modules can also be called remotely.

Hint

For more information, see the Documentation Programming with External Commands in SAP Help Portal.

Example

Calls the operating system statement ping for the central database server of the system on the host computer of the current AS instance using the logical command name PING defined by SAP. The result of the call is passed to the internal table result. The function module SXPG\_CALL\_SYSTEM can raise more specific exceptions than those handled explicitly here.

Unwanted Calls of Operating System Statements

Alongside calls of function modules in the [SXPG framework](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm), operating system statements for the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance can be executed in ABAP programs as follows:

-   The addition [FILTER](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_os_addition.htm) of the statement [OPEN DATASET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset.htm) used for executing operating system statements using pipes.

-   The internal statement [CALL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall-.htm) used to call a special system function (SYSTEM), which can be used to execute operating system statements.

Neither of these options should be used for common execution of operating system statements in ABAP programs.

-   The addition [FILTER](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset_os_addition.htm) of [OPEN DATASET](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapopen_dataset.htm) should only be used (if at all) for operating system statements required for data handling.

-   Calls of the system function SYSTEM with the internal statement [CALL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall-.htm) should never be made and can be deactivated using the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") rdisp/call\_system. If called, it then raises an uncatchable exception.

Both statements cause the following problems:

-   There are no central authorization checks.

-   The platform dependency of the operating system statements must be handled in the ABAP program itself.

-   Errors and exceptions cannot be handled specifically.

-   If input from external sources is used, it must be checked thoroughly and filtered to prevent [system command injections](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abensys_comm_injections_scrty.htm) on any platform.

If possible, the [SXPG framework](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm) should be used instead of these two options.

Hint

Before the statements CALL 'SYSTEM' is deactivated using the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") rdisp/call\_system, it must be ensured that it is no longer used in any programs. Any programs that still use CALL 'SYSTEM' must first be switched to use of the [SXPG frameworks](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm) before the unwanted statement can be deactivated. The options in the SXPG frameworks generally cover all requirements when calling operating system statements.

Example

Calls the operating system statement ping for the central database server of the system on the [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current AS instance using the addition FILTER of the statement OPEN DATASET. The output of the operating system statement is written to the opened file and can be read from there.

DATA dbserver TYPE c LENGTH 255.

¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ID 'VALUE' FIELD¬†¬†dbserver.

The result of the call is passed to the internal table result. This example can only be executed if the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") rdisp/call\_system allows the call.

CALL, System Function Call

This statement is for internal use only.
It must not be used in application programs.

Syntax

CALL cfunc.

Addition:

[... ID id1 FIELD f1 ... ID idn FIELD fn](#!ABAP_ONE_ADD@1@)

Effect

Calls the system function cfunc. A flat character-like data object containing the name of the function can be specified for cfunc. The function must be entered in the file sapactab.h. Modifying a function or creating a new function requires the ABAP kernel to be compiled again and linked. This requires the C source code files.

System Fields

The CALL statement itself does not set any system fields. Whether system fields such as sy-subrc are set depends on the system function called.

Hints

-   If possible, use [kernel methods](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenkernel_methods.htm) instead of system functions.

-   External programs should be called using the RFC mechanism: [CALL FUNCTION ... DESTINATION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall_function_destination.htm).

-   With some critical C functions, the system performs an authorization check automatically. If the user does not have the appropriate authorization, a runtime error occurs. The authorization can be checked using the function module AUTHORITY\_CHECK\_C\_FUNCTION.

-   The use of the system function SYSTEM, which can be used to execute operating system statements of the current [host computer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), is not recommended and can be deactivated using the [profile parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprofile_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") rdisp/call\_system. If called, it then raises an uncatchable exception. If absolutely necessary, operating system statements can be called using the function modules in the [SXPG framework](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_sxpg.htm). This addresses specific statements using logical command names created by the system administrator in the transaction SM69. See also [Unwanted Calls of Operating System Statements](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_system_commands_appl_depr.htm).

Security Hint

Calls of system functions whose names or parameters are injected into the program from outside present a serious security risk. The values from outside must be checked thoroughly before being used. See [System Command Injections](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abensys_comm_injections_scrty.htm).

Addition

... ID id1 FIELD f1 ... ID idn FIELD fn

Effect

Passes fields to the called program using pass by reference. ID id1 is used to specify the name of a formal parameter and FIELD f1 is used to specify the associated field from the ABAP program. If a formal parameter expects an internal table, the latter is passed in the form FIELD tab\[\].

Example

Query of the current database server.

DATA dbserver TYPE c LENGTH 255.
CALL 'C\_SAPGPARAM' ID 'NAME'¬†¬†FIELD 'SAPDBHOST'
¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ID 'VALUE' FIELD¬†¬†dbserver.

[Exceptions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_language_exceptions.htm)

Uncatchable Exceptions

-   Cause: No authorization to call this C function.
    Runtime error: CALL\_C\_FUNCTION\_NO\_AUTHORITY

-   Cause: The system function specified is unknown.
    Runtime error: CALL\_C\_FUNCTION\_NOT\_FOUND

-   Cause: The system function SYSTEM is disabled.
    Runtime error: CALL\_SYSTEM\_DISABLED

[ABAP - Keyword Documentation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap.htm)¬†‚Üí¬† [ABAP - Programming Language](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_reference.htm)¬†‚Üí¬† [SAP GUI User Dialogs](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_screens.htm)¬†‚Üí¬† [General Dynpros](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_dynpros.htm)¬†‚Üí¬†

dynpro - User Interface

For the execution of user dialogs, input and output services are required that can be accessed through a user interface (UI). A user interface is used for the interaction between a user and a program. If parts of the user interface are displayed in the GUI window on the screen, this is a graphical user interface (GUI). The SAP-specific implementation for the execution of dialog-based applications with [dynpros](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenas_abap_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is SAP GUI, which is installed as a component of the [AS ABAP](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenas_abap_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [presentation layer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenpresentation_layer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") on the presentation servers. It contains all the control elements that are required for execution of dialogs between the user and the program. The operating elements of the SAP GUI are represented schematically in the following diagram:

![Figure](abdoc_gui.gif)

On the screen, SAP GUI presents the [screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenscreen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of a dynpro (dynamic program) in a GUI window. The screen can contain screen elements for displaying contents or for receiving user actions. The screen and its screen elements are processed using [Layout Editor](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenlayout_editor_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in the Screen Painter tool. Each screen element has properties that are statically predefined in [Screen Painter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenscreen_painter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and, in part, can be modified dynamically in the ABAP program.

As a further part of the graphical user interface, each standard window contains a menu bar, a standard toolbar, and an application toolbar. GUI windows that are displayed as a modal dialog box contain only an application toolbar. The bars are standalone components of the ABAP program and are grouped together in a GUI status. Also, they are assigned to a dynpro when the GUI status is set. In addition to the graphical elements, the function keys are part of the user interface. They are defined as an independent component of the ABAP program and therefore part of a GUI status. The components of the GUI status and the GUI status itself are processed using the Menu Painter tool. For the most part, the control elements presented by the user interface are linked with the function codes, which can be evaluated in the ABAP program. The description of the current GUI status can be found in the system field sy-pfkey.

A GUI window in SAP GUI is complete when it has a title bar and a status bar. The title bar, which is also edited using Menu Painter, contains the heading of the GUI window. The status bar displays information that can be transmitted, among other things, during the execution of an ABAP program using the [MESSAGE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmessage.htm) statement. In addition, it contains system information that can be displayed or hidden through an icon on the right-hand side of the bar.

dynpro - GUI Statuses and Function Codes

This example demonstrates how to set the GUI status and evaluate function codes.

Source Code

PROGRAM demo\_dynpro\_gui\_status.
DATA: ok\_code TYPE sy-ucomm,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†save\_ok LIKE ok\_code,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†output¬†¬†LIKE ok\_code.
CALL SCREEN 100.
MODULE init\_screen\_0100 OUTPUT.
¬†¬†SET PF-STATUS 'STATUS\_100'.
¬†¬†SET TITLEBAR '100'.
ENDMODULE.
MODULE user\_command\_0100 INPUT.
¬†¬†save\_ok = ok\_code.
¬†¬†CLEAR ok\_code.
¬†¬†CASE save\_ok.
¬†¬†¬†¬†WHEN 'BACK' OR 'EXIT' OR 'CANCEL'.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†LEAVE PROGRAM.
¬†¬†¬†¬†WHEN OTHERS.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†output = save\_ok.
¬†¬†ENDCASE.
ENDMODULE.

Description

The static next dynpro number of dynpro 100 is 100. The screen field of output is defined as not ready for input in Screen Painter. The module init\_screen\_0100 sets the GUI status status\_0100 and the title 100 in the PBO event. All function codes exist as menu entries, but not all of them are assigned to function keys. The function codes in the standard toolbar activate the icons and are automatically assigned to their function keys. Some of the additional function keys are assigned to the application toolbar. The module user\_command\_0100 first assigns the contents of the field ok\_code to the helper variable save\_ok and initializes ok\_code. This procedure is always recommended since it makes sure that the dynpro field ok\_code is also reinitialized in the PBO event and does not contain any unwanted values. Then the function code chosen is assigned to the field output and displayed in the corresponding screen field, except for BACK, EXIT, and CANCEL. The latter exits the program. The function code SELE can be passed to the ABAP program in the following ways:

-   Choosing Choose in the Edit menu

-   Choosing the Choose pushbutton in the application toolbar

-   Choosing F2 on the keyboard

-   Pressing the right mouse button and choosing Choose

-   Double-clicking the screen field of output

-   Entering SELE in the command field and choosing ENTER

The other function codes are passed in accordance with their definition, but without the double-click function.

HIDE

[Short Reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abaphide_shortref.htm)

Syntax

HIDE dobj.

Effect

This statement stores the content of a variable dobj together with the current list line whose line number is contained in sy-linno in the [hide area](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhide_area_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current list level. The data type of the variable dobj must be [flat](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenflat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and no field symbols or components of [boxed components](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenboxed_component_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") can be specified that point to rows of internal tables, and no class attributes can be specified. The saved values can be read as followed:

-   Any user action on a displayed screen list that causes a list event assigns all values saved using HIDE to the relevant variables.
    

-   If a list line of a list level is read or modified using the statements [READ LINE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapread_line.htm) or [MODIFY LINE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmodify_line.htm), all the values of this line saved using HIDE are assigned to the relevant variables.
    

Hints

-   The HIDE statement works independently of whether the [list cursor](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenlist_cursor_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") was set. In particular, variables for empty list lines can be stored (that is, lines in which the list cursor was positioned using statements like [SKIP](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapskip.htm)).
    

-   The HIDE statement should be executed directly in the statement that has set the list cursor in the line.
    

-   Using the HIDE statement on a field symbol can cause runtime errors. The syntax check creates a warning.
    

Example

Saving square numbers and cubic numbers for a list of numbers. The example shows that any variable can be stored independently of the line content. In the real world, one would more likely save only the number and execute the calculation, when required, in the event block for [AT LINE-SELECTION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapat_line-selection.htm).

DATA: square TYPE i,

¬†¬†FORMAT HOTSPOT.
¬†¬†DO 10 TIMES.
¬†¬†¬†¬†square = sy-index \*\* 2.
¬†¬†¬†¬†cube¬†¬† = sy-index \*\* 3.
¬†¬†¬†¬†WRITE / sy-index.
¬†¬†¬†¬†HIDE: square, cube.

[Exceptions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_language_exceptions.htm)

Uncatchable Exceptions

-   Cause: The field is too long for HIDE.
    Runtime error: HIDE\_FIELD\_TOO\_LARGE

-   Cause: HIDE in a table line or a component in a table line is not possible.
    Runtime error: HIDE\_ILLEGAL\_ITAB\_SYMBOL

Description

At START-OF-SELECTION time, the status FLIGHT is set for the basic list. In the status FLIGHT, the function key F2 and a pushbutton are assigned the function code SELE (text SELECT). This means the event AT USER-COMMAND is raised when the user double-clicks, presses F2, or chooses the pushbutton SELECT.

The three fields spfli-carrid, spfli-connid, and num are written to the [Hide](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhide_area_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") area while the basic list is created. After a line is selected, the details list defined for the function code SELE in AT USER-COMMAND is displayed. After the AT USER-COMMAND event, all fields of the selected line that were stored in the Hide area are loaded again. num is used to check whether a line from the actual list was selected. The details list is given the status BOOKING, where F2 is assigned the function code INFO (with the text Booking Information) The details list displays data which can be selected using the Hide fields of the basic list. For each list line displayed, the system stores additional information in the [Hide](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhide_area_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") area.

If the user selects a line of the details list, the system displays the stored information in a dialog box with the status WIND. For the WIND status, the default values are applied when the list status is synchronized. sbook-bookid is used to check whether a valid line was selected.

The program itself sets all page headers and the title bar of the dialog box.

HIDE

[Short Reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abaphide_shortref.htm)

Syntax

HIDE dobj.

Effect

This statement stores the content of a variable dobj together with the current list line whose line number is contained in sy-linno in the [hide area](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhide_area_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current list level. The data type of the variable dobj must be [flat](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenflat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and no field symbols or components of [boxed components](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenboxed_component_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") can be specified that point to rows of internal tables, and no class attributes can be specified. The saved values can be read as followed:

-   Any user action on a displayed screen list that causes a list event assigns all values saved using HIDE to the relevant variables.
    

-   If a list line of a list level is read or modified using the statements [READ LINE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapread_line.htm) or [MODIFY LINE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmodify_line.htm), all the values of this line saved using HIDE are assigned to the relevant variables.
    

Hints

-   The HIDE statement works independently of whether the [list cursor](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenlist_cursor_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") was set. In particular, variables for empty list lines can be stored (that is, lines in which the list cursor was positioned using statements like [SKIP](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapskip.htm)).
    

-   The HIDE statement should be executed directly in the statement that has set the list cursor in the line.
    

-   Using the HIDE statement on a field symbol can cause runtime errors. The syntax check creates a warning.
    

Example

Saving square numbers and cubic numbers for a list of numbers. The example shows that any variable can be stored independently of the line content. In the real world, one would more likely save only the number and execute the calculation, when required, in the event block for [AT LINE-SELECTION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapat_line-selection.htm).

DATA: square TYPE i,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†cube¬†¬† TYPE i.
START-OF-SELECTION.
¬†¬†FORMAT HOTSPOT.
¬†¬†DO 10 TIMES.
¬†¬†¬†¬†square = sy-index \*\* 2.

¬†¬†¬†¬†WRITE / sy-index.
¬†¬†¬†¬†HIDE: square, cube.
¬†¬†ENDDO.
AT LINE-SELECTION.
¬†¬†WRITE: square, cube.

[Exceptions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_language_exceptions.htm)

Uncatchable Exceptions

-   Cause: The field is too long for HIDE.
    Runtime error: HIDE\_FIELD\_TOO\_LARGE

-   Cause: HIDE in a table line or a component in a table line is not possible.
    Runtime error: HIDE\_ILLEGAL\_ITAB\_SYMBOL

-   Cause: HIDE in a local field is not possible.
    Runtime error: HIDE\_NO\_LOCAL

Description

At START-OF-SELECTION time, the status FLIGHT is set for the basic list. In the status FLIGHT, the function key F2 and a pushbutton are assigned the function code SELE (text SELECT). This means the event AT USER-COMMAND is raised when the user double-clicks, presses F2, or chooses the pushbutton SELECT.

The three fields spfli-carrid, spfli-connid, and num are written to the [Hide](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhide_area_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") area while the basic list is created. After a line is selected, the details list defined for the function code SELE in AT USER-COMMAND is displayed. After the AT USER-COMMAND event, all fields of the selected line that were stored in the Hide area are loaded again. num is used to check whether a line from the actual list was selected. The details list is given the status BOOKING, where F2 is assigned the function code INFO (with the text Booking Information) The details list displays data which can be selected using the Hide fields of the basic list. For each list line displayed, the system stores additional information in the [Hide](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhide_area_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") area.

If the user selects a line of the details list, the system displays the stored information in a dialog box with the status WIND. For the WIND status, the default values are applied when the list status is synchronized. sbook-bookid is used to check whether a valid line was selected.

The program itself sets all page headers and the title bar of the dialog box.

HIDE

[Short Reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abaphide_shortref.htm)

Syntax

HIDE dobj.

Effect

This statement stores the content of a variable dobj together with the current list line whose line number is contained in sy-linno in the [hide area](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhide_area_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current list level. The data type of the variable dobj must be [flat](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenflat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and no field symbols or components of [boxed components](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenboxed_component_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") can be specified that point to rows of internal tables, and no class attributes can be specified. The saved values can be read as followed:

-   Any user action on a displayed screen list that causes a list event assigns all values saved using HIDE to the relevant variables.
    

-   If a list line of a list level is read or modified using the statements [READ LINE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapread_line.htm) or [MODIFY LINE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmodify_line.htm), all the values of this line saved using HIDE are assigned to the relevant variables.
    

Hints

-   The HIDE statement works independently of whether the [list cursor](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenlist_cursor_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") was set. In particular, variables for empty list lines can be stored (that is, lines in which the list cursor was positioned using statements like [SKIP](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapskip.htm)).
    

-   The HIDE statement should be executed directly in the statement that has set the list cursor in the line.
    

-   Using the HIDE statement on a field symbol can cause runtime errors. The syntax check creates a warning.
    

Example

Saving square numbers and cubic numbers for a list of numbers. The example shows that any variable can be stored independently of the line content. In the real world, one would more likely save only the number and execute the calculation, when required, in the event block for [AT LINE-SELECTION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapat_line-selection.htm).

[Exceptions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_language_exceptions.htm)

Uncatchable Exceptions

-   Cause: The field is too long for HIDE.

Description

At START-OF-SELECTION time, the status FLIGHT is set for the basic list. In the status FLIGHT, the function key F2 and a pushbutton are assigned the function code SELE (text SELECT). This means the event AT USER-COMMAND is raised when the user double-clicks, presses F2, or chooses the pushbutton SELECT.

The three fields spfli-carrid, spfli-connid, and num are written to the [Hide](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhide_area_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") area while the basic list is created. After a line is selected, the details list defined for the function code SELE in AT USER-COMMAND is displayed. After the AT USER-COMMAND event, all fields of the selected line that were stored in the Hide area are loaded again. num is used to check whether a line from the actual list was selected. The details list is given the status BOOKING, where F2 is assigned the function code INFO (with the text Booking Information) The details list displays data which can be selected using the Hide fields of the basic list. For each list line displayed, the system stores additional information in the [Hide](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenhide_area_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") area.

If the user selects a line of the details list, the system displays the stored information in a dialog box with the status WIND. For the WIND status, the default values are applied when the list status is synchronized. sbook-bookid is used to check whether a valid line was selected.

The program itself sets all page headers and the title bar of the dialog box.

[Short Reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapread_line_shortref.htm)

Syntax

READ *{* *{*LINE line *\[**{*OF PAGE page*}**|**{*OF CURRENT PAGE*}**\]*
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† *\[*INDEX idx*\]**}*

[2\. ... CURRENT LINE](#!ABAP_ADDITION_2@2@)

Effect

This statement assigns the content of a line stored in the list buffer to the system field sy-lisel, and allows other target fields to be specified in [result](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapread_line_result.htm). In addition, all values for this line saved using [HIDE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abaphide.htm) are assigned to the respective variables.

The line read is specified using the addition LINE or using CURRENT LINE.

System Fields

sy-subrc

Meaning

0

The specified line exists and was read.

Not 0

The specified line does not exist.

Addition 1

... LINE line *\[**{*OF PAGE page *}**|**{*OF CURRENT PAGE*}**\]* *\[*INDEX idx*\]*

Effect

In the addition LINE, line expects a data object of the type i, which contains the line number based on the list page of a list level.

The list level can be specified with the addition INDEX, where idx expects a data object (which contains the list index) of type i. The value of idx must be greater than or equal to 0. If the addition INDEX is not specified, the list level 0 (the basic list itself) is selected when the basic list is created and the list level at which the event was raised (sy-listi) is selected when a list event is processed.

The list page can be specified either with PAGE page or with CURRENT PAGE. page expects a data object of the type i that contains the page number of an existing page of the list level. No line is selected if no line is found for the specified values in line, idx and page. CURRENT PAGE indicates the topmost displayed page of the list, on which the last list event has taken place. No line is selected while creating the basic list. If no addition is specified for the page, the current page (sy-pagno) is selected when the basic list is created, and the page on which the event was raised (sy-cpage) is selected during the processing of a list event.

Addition 2

... CURRENT LINE

Effect

For the addition CURRENT LINE, the line on which the screen cursor was positioned during a preceding list event (sy-lilli), or the last line read with a preceding READ LINE statement, is selected. No line is selected while creating the basic list.

Example

This example reads all lines of the basic list after selecting a line. The content of the checkbox is assigned to the output data object flag. A target field wa with length 10 is used for the date, since this is the length of the output area and contains separators. If an assignment was made to the output field date, the area length would be reduced. The checked data is displayed in the details list.

DATA: date TYPE d,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†flag TYPE c LENGTH 1,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†wa¬†¬† TYPE c LENGTH 10.

[2\. ... FIELD VALUE dobj1 *\[*INTO wa1*\]* dobj2 *\[*INTO wa2*\]* ...](#!ABAP_ADDITION_2@2@)

Effect

Specifies target fields for READ LINE.

Addition 1

... LINE VALUE INTO wa

Effect

The addition LINE VALUE assigns the formatted content of the complete list line in the list buffer to the data object wa.

Addition 2

... FIELD VALUE dobj1 *\[*INTO wa1*\]* dobj2 *\[*INTO wa2*\]* ...

Effect

The addition FIELD VALUE assigns the output areas of single data objects dobj1 dobj2... (which have been output to the list buffer) to these data objects, or (if specified) to the data objects wa1 wa2 .... wa or wa1 wa2 ... expects data objects whose data type is covered by the generic type [simple](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbuilt_in_types_generic.htm), except for [enumerated objects](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenenumerated_object_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The list line or data objects dobj1 dobj2 ... are handled as if they have the data type c, which means that trailing blanks are ignored.

If data objects dobj1 dobj2... appear more than once in a line with the same name, only the first object is read. If a data object dobj1 dobj2 ... is not found at all, the specification is ignored.

If the output area of a data object addressed in the [WRITE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapwrite-.htm) statement using a field symbol needs to be read, and the same data object is no longer assigned to the field symbol, the name of the data object must be specified and not the name of the field symbol.

Hints

-   No [conversion routine](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconversion_routine_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is executed when an output area is read.
    

-   The content of the line or of the individual output areas in the list is character-like and formatted according to the rules for the WRITE statement. When the read line or an area is assigned to a data object, the conversion rules apply in the same way as to a [source field of type c](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenconversion_type_c.htm). This can cause problems with the target fields dobj1 dob ... or war war ..., particularly if these fields are numeric and the output contains separators. Due to this, use of READ LINE is mainly recommended for the evaluation of fields that are ready for input. For other evaluations, [HIDE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abaphide.htm) can be used to save values in a type-compliant way.

Effect

This statement assigns the content of a line stored in the list buffer to the system field sy-lisel, and allows other target fields to be specified in [result](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapread_line_result.htm). In addition, all values for this line saved using [HIDE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abaphide.htm) are assigned to the respective variables.

The line read is specified using the addition LINE or using CURRENT LINE.

System Fields

sy-subrc

Meaning

0

The specified line exists and was read.

Not 0

The specified line does not exist.

Addition 1

... LINE line *\[**{*OF PAGE page *}**|**{*OF CURRENT PAGE*}**\]* *\[*INDEX idx*\]*

Effect

In the addition LINE, line expects a data object of the type i, which contains the line number based on the list page of a list level.

The list level can be specified with the addition INDEX, where idx expects a data object (which contains the list index) of type i. The value of idx must be greater than or equal to 0. If the addition INDEX is not specified, the list level 0 (the basic list itself) is selected when the basic list is created and the list level at which the event was raised (sy-listi) is selected when a list event is processed.

The list page can be specified either with PAGE page or with CURRENT PAGE. page expects a data object of the type i that contains the page number of an existing page of the list level. No line is selected if no line is found for the specified values in line, idx and page. CURRENT PAGE indicates the topmost displayed page of the list, on which the last list event has taken place. No line is selected while creating the basic list. If no addition is specified for the page, the current page (sy-pagno) is selected when the basic list is created, and the page on which the event was raised (sy-cpage) is selected during the processing of a list event.

Addition 2

... CURRENT LINE

Effect

For the addition CURRENT LINE, the line on which the screen cursor was positioned during a preceding list event (sy-lilli), or the last line read with a preceding READ LINE statement, is selected. No line is selected while creating the basic list.

Example

This example reads all lines of the basic list after selecting a line. The content of the checkbox is assigned to the output data object flag. A target field wa with length 10 is used for the date, since this is the length of the output area and contains separators. If an assignment was made to the output field date, the area length would be reduced. The checked data is displayed in the details list.

DATA: date TYPE d,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†flag TYPE c LENGTH 1,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†wa¬†¬† TYPE c LENGTH 10.

[2\. ... CURRENT LINE](#!ABAP_ADDITION_2@2@)

Effect

This statement overwrites a line saved in the list buffer with the content of the sy-lisel system field and allows additional modifications as specified in [source](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmodify_line_modification.htm). In addition, all values for this line saved using HIDE are assigned to the respective variables.

The first output of a data object in the list buffer with the statement [WRITE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapwrite-.htm) defines the output length, which cannot be changed by the MODIFY statement. The statement MODIFY ignores any output [alignments](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenalignment_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that are specified for the output with WRITE and [CENTERED, RIGHT-JUSTIFIED](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapwrite_to_options.htm).

System Fields

sy-subrc

Meaning

0

The specified line exists and was changed.

Not 0

The specified line does not exist.

Hints

-   It is recommended that the system field sy-lisel is filled with the content of the list line to be changed before the statement MODIFY LINE is executed, and that the line is modified exclusively using the information in [source](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmodify_line_modification.htm), not by changing sy-lisel. The sy-lisel system field is filled either using list events or with the statement [READ LINE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapread_line.htm).

-   The function modules LIST\_ICON\_PREPARE\_FOR\_MODIFY and LIST\_MODIFY\_QUICKINFO can be used to modify icons and tooltips in list lines.
    

Addition 1

... LINE line *\[**{*OF PAGE page*}**|**{*OF CURRENT PAGE*}**\]* *\[*INDEX idx*\]*

Addition 2

... CURRENT LINE

Effect

The line to be changed is specified using the addition LINE or CURRENT LINE. The syntax and description of the additions are the same as for the statement [READ LINE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapread_line.htm).

Example

When a line in the basic list is double-clicked, the background of the number displayed becomes yellow, and the background of the remaining line becomes green.

[4\. ... FIELD FORMAT dobj1 ext\_format\_options1 ...](#!ABAP_ADDITION_4@4@)

Effect

Specifies source fields for MODIFY LINE. The additions modify the list line once this has been overwritten with the content of the sy-lisel system field.

Addition 1

... LINE VALUE FROM wa

Effect

The addition LINE VALUE overwrites the whole list line with the content of wa.

Addition 2

... FIELD VALUE dobj1 *\[*FROM wa1*\]* dobj2 *\[*FROM wa2*\]* ...

Effect

The addition FIELD VALUE overwrites the output areas of individual dobj1 dobj2 ... data objects that are shown in the list line with the current content of these objects, or (if specified) the content of the data objects wa1 wa2 .... wa or wa1 wa2 ... expect character-like data objects, which are truncated if they are too long. For data objects that are too short, the line or the output areas are filled from the right with blank characters. If specified, FIELD VALUE overrides LINE VALUE.

If data objects dobj1 dobj2... appear more than once in a line with the same name, only the first one is processed. If a data object dobj1 dobj2 ... is not found at all, the specification is ignored.

Addition 3

... LINE FORMAT ext\_format\_options

Addition 4

... FIELD FORMAT dobj1 ext\_format\_options1 ...

Effect

For ext\_format\_options, one or more additions of the statement [FORMAT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapformat.htm) can be specified. The addition FRAMES cannot be used. The addition LINE FORMAT formats the whole list line accordingly; FIELD FORMAT formats only the output areas of the dobj1 dobj2 ... data objects displayed in the list line. If specified, FIELD FORMAT overrides LINE FORMAT.

If data objects dobj1 dobj2... appear more than once in a line with the same name, only the first one is processed. If a data object dobj1 dobj2 ... is not found at all, the specification is ignored.

SCROLL LIST

[Short Reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapscroll_shortref.htm)

Syntax

SCROLL LIST *\[*[horizontal](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapscroll_list_horizontal.htm)*\]*
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†*\[*[vertical](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapscroll_list_vertical.htm)*\]*
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†*\[*INDEX idx*\]*.

Addition:

[... INDEX idx](#!ABAP_ONE_ADD@1@)

Effect

This statement scrolls the display area of a list stored in the list buffer to the position specified in [horizontal](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapscroll_list_horizontal.htm) and/or [vertical](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapscroll_list_vertical.htm). At least one of these additions must be specified, in which all horizontal specifications refer to the columns of a displayed list. The corresponding section is displayed when the list is next displayed.

If the SCROLL statement is not used, a list is displayed during the initial display, starting from the first column of the first line. If the user navigates from a details list back to a lower list level, the list is displayed with the section in which it was last displayed. The SCROLL statement sets a new first column, a new first line, or both. Each SCROLL statement sets only the size specified in it, without changing the other positions.

Addition

... INDEX idx

Effect

The list level can be specified with the addition INDEX, where idx expects a data object (which contains the list index) of type i. The value of idx must be greater than or equal to 0. If the addition INDEX is not specified, the list level 0 (the basic list itself) is selected when the basic list is created and the list level at which the event was raised (sy-listi) is selected when a list event is processed. If the list level specified in idx is not available, sy-subrc is set to the value 8.

System Fields

sy-subrc

Meaning

0

Screen section was scrolled.

4

Complete scrolling not possible because the list margin was reached.

8

Scrolling not possible because the specified list level does not exist.

Hint

While scrolling through the list that is being created (sy-lsind), it should be noted that a SCROLL statement is ignored prior to the first output statement, since the list does not yet exist in the list buffer.

Example

By double-clicking the basic list, it is possible to scroll down this list in the event block [AT LINE-SELECTION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapat_line-selection.htm) to the page entered in a [selection screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenselection_screen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The lines on the page retain their original position with reference to the [page header](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenpage_header_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") by using sy-staro. However, it is not necessary to set the column to sy-staco explicitly, since this position is retained during vertical scrolling.

[Short Reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapscroll_shortref.htm)

Syntax

... *{*TO COLUMN col*}*
¬†¬†*|* *{**{*LEFT*|*RIGHT*}* *\[*BY n PLACES*\]**}* ...

Alternatives:

[1\. ... TO COLUMN col](#!ABAP_ALTERNATIVE_1@1@)
[2\. ... LEFT *\[*BY n PLACES*\]*](#!ABAP_ALTERNATIVE_2@2@)
[3\. ... RIGHT *\[*BY n PLACES*\]*](#!ABAP_ALTERNATIVE_3@3@)

Effect

These additions are used to scroll horizontally in the list.

Hint

When scrolling horizontally using the statement SCROLL, only the upper or lower limit of data objects displayed should be displayed. This is because the positions in the list buffer and in the list displayed only match for these limit values.

Alternative 1

... TO COLUMN col

Effect

The addition TO COLUMN specifies the value from col for the first column in the screen segment; col expects a data object of type i. If the value in col is less than or equal to 0, it is processed as 1; if it is greater than the current line width, it is processed as if it was the same as the line width and a value of 4 is set for sy-subrc.

Alternative 2

... LEFT *\[*BY n PLACES*\]*

Effect

The addition LEFT without BY n PLACES enters a value of 1 for the first column in the screen segment. The addition LEFT with BY n PLACES enters the current first column (sy-staco) minus the value in n as the first column in the display segment; n expects a data object of type i. If the result is less than or equal to 0, it is processed as 1 and a value of 4 is set for sy-subrc.

Alternative 3

... RIGHT *\[*BY n PLACES*\]*

Effect

The addition RIGHT without BY n PLACES enters the line length (sy-linsz) minus the window width (sy-scols minus 2) for the first column in the screen segment. If the result is less than or equal to 0, it is processed as 1. The addition RIGHT with BY n PLACES enters the current first column (sy-staco) plus the value in n for the first column in the display segment; n expects a data object of type i. If the result is greater than the current line length, it is processed as if it were the same as the line length and a value of 4 is set for sy-subrc.

SCROLL LIST, vertical

[Short Reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapscroll_shortref.htm)

Syntax

... *{*TO *{**{*FIRST PAGE*}**|**{*LAST PAGE*}**|**{*PAGE pag*}**}* *\[*LINE lin*\]**}*
¬†¬†*|* *{**{*FORWARD*|*BACKWARD*}* *\[*n PAGES*\]**}* ...

Alternatives:

[1\. ... TO FIRST PAGE](#!ABAP_ALTERNATIVE_1@1@)
[2\. ... TO LAST PAGE](#!ABAP_ALTERNATIVE_2@2@)
[3\. ... TO PAGE pag](#!ABAP_ALTERNATIVE_3@3@)
[4\. ... *{*FORWARD*|*BACKWARD*}* *\[*n PAGES*\]*](#!ABAP_ALTERNATIVE_4@4@)

Addition:

[... LINE lin](#!ABAP_ONE_ADD@1@)

Effect

These additions are used to scroll vertically in the list.

Alternative 1

... TO FIRST PAGE

Effect

The addition TO FIRST PAGE defines the top page in the screen segment on the first page in the list.

Alternative 2

... TO LAST PAGE

Effect

The addition TO LAST PAGE defines the top page in the screen segment on the last page in the list.

Alternative 3

... TO PAGE pag

Effect

The addition TO PAGE pag defines the top page in the screen segment on the page specified in pag; pag expects a data object of type i. If the value in pag is 0 or less, it is processed as 1; if it is greater than the number of pages, it is processed as if it were the number of pages a value of 4 is set for sy-subrc.

Addition

... LINE lin

Effect

The addition LINE specifies which line is displayed first on the pages selected using PAGE. If the addition LINE is not used, the list is displayed starting with the first line on the selected page. If the addition LINE is specified, the line on the selected page specified in lin is displayed under the [page header](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenpage_header_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), not counting the page header. lin expects a data object of type i. If the value in lin is 0 or less, it is processed as 1; if it is greater than the page length, it is processed as if it were the same as the page length and a value of 4 is set for sy-subrc.

Alternative 4

... *{*FORWARD*|*BACKWARD*}* *\[*n PAGES*\]*

Effect

The additions FORWARD and BACKWARD without n PAGES move the current screen segment up or down by the current number of lines in the GUI window (sy-srows). The [page header](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenpage_header_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the top page displayed is always displayed first.

The additions FORWARD and BACKWARD with n PAGES define the top page in the screen segment on the page derived by adding or subtracting the value in n from the current top page; n expects a data object of type i. If the resulting value is less than or equal to 0 is greater than the number of pages, it is processed as 1 or as if it were the same as the number of pages and a value of 4 is set for sy-subrc. The resulting page is displayed starting with the first line.

SCROLL LIST

[Short Reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapscroll_shortref.htm)

Syntax

SCROLL LIST *\[*[horizontal](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapscroll_list_horizontal.htm)*\]*
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†*\[*[vertical](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapscroll_list_vertical.htm)*\]*
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†*\[*INDEX idx*\]*.

Addition:

[... INDEX idx](#!ABAP_ONE_ADD@1@)

Effect

This statement scrolls the display area of a list stored in the list buffer to the position specified in [horizontal](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapscroll_list_horizontal.htm) and/or [vertical](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapscroll_list_vertical.htm). At least one of these additions must be specified, in which all horizontal specifications refer to the columns of a displayed list. The corresponding section is displayed when the list is next displayed.

If the SCROLL statement is not used, a list is displayed during the initial display, starting from the first column of the first line. If the user navigates from a details list back to a lower list level, the list is displayed with the section in which it was last displayed. The SCROLL statement sets a new first column, a new first line, or both. Each SCROLL statement sets only the size specified in it, without changing the other positions.

Addition

... INDEX idx

Effect

The list level can be specified with the addition INDEX, where idx expects a data object (which contains the list index) of type i. The value of idx must be greater than or equal to 0. If the addition INDEX is not specified, the list level 0 (the basic list itself) is selected when the basic list is created and the list level at which the event was raised (sy-listi) is selected when a list event is processed. If the list level specified in idx is not available, sy-subrc is set to the value 8.

System Fields

sy-subrc

Meaning

0

Screen section was scrolled.

4

Complete scrolling not possible because the list margin was reached.

8

Scrolling not possible because the specified list level does not exist.

Hint

While scrolling through the list that is being created (sy-lsind), it should be noted that a SCROLL statement is ignored prior to the first output statement, since the list does not yet exist in the list buffer.

Example

By double-clicking the basic list, it is possible to scroll down this list in the event block [AT LINE-SELECTION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapat_line-selection.htm) to the page entered in a [selection screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenselection_screen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The lines on the page retain their original position with reference to the [page header](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenpage_header_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") by using sy-staro. However, it is not necessary to set the column to sy-staco explicitly, since this position is retained during vertical scrolling.

Lists - Display

A basic list is either displayed automatically or in a program-driven way. A details list is always displayed automatically:

-   In [executable programs](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenexecutable_program_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") called using [SUBMIT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapsubmit.htm), the basic list created up to that point is displayed automatically after the event [END-OF-SELECTION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapend-of-selection.htm). At the start of the program, the [standard list status](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenstandard_list_status_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is set automatically, which can be replaced by another GUI status in the program using [SET PF-STATUS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapset_pf-status_list.htm).

-   In any program that can contain dynpros as components, a display of the current basic list can be called during processing of a [dynpro sequence](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendynpro_sequence_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") (program-driven).

-   In any program that can contain dynpros as components, the details list created in a processing block is displayed automatically when the processing block is terminated after [AT LINE-SELECTION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapat_line-selection.htm), [AT USER-COMMAND](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapat_user-command.htm), or [AT PFnn](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapat_pfnn.htm). If no details list is created, the previous list level is displayed.

The following sections cover the statements

LEAVE TO LIST-PROCESSING

[Short Reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapleave_to_list-process_shortref.htm)

Syntax

LEAVE TO LIST-PROCESSING *\[*AND RETURN TO SCREEN dynnr*\]*.

Addition:

[... AND RETURN TO SCREEN dynnr](#!ABAP_ONE_ADD@1@)

Effect

This statement can be executed during [PBO](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenpbo_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and [PAI](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenpai_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") processing. After the current dynpro is processed, this statement interrupts the current [dynpro sequence](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendynpro_sequence_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), starts the list processor, and displays the basic list. The basic list consists of any list output of all PBO and PAI modules of the dynpro sequence executed to this point. The statement is ignored in the event blocks for [reporting events](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenreporting_event_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and [list events](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenlist_event_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

The [screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenscreen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the [list dynpro](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenlist_dynpro_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the list processor replaces the screen shown in the [popup level](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenpop-up_level_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") 0. Any modal dialog windows stacked above this are hidden while the list is being displayed. The GUI status set in the dynpro sequence is used. Any list events raised by user actions in the GUI window of the list dynpro call the event blocks of the current [main program](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenmain_program_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). Any details lists created there are displayed by the list processor in the GUI window of the basic list (unless the statement [WINDOW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapwindow.htm) is used).

The user can exit the list processor or list display by selecting the functions Back, Exit, or Cancel in the display for list level 0, or by means of a program that uses the [LEAVE LIST-PROCESSING](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapleave_list-processing.htm) statement. By default, the interrupted dynpro sequence resumes in both cases with the PBO processing of the dynpro in which the list processor was called.

Addition

... AND RETURN TO SCREEN dynnr

Effect

Using the addition AND RETURN TO SCREEN, another dynpro can be specified in dynnr for continuing PBO processing. dynnr expects a character-like data object that contains the number of a dynpro in the current main program.

Hints

-   If the current dynpro is displayed in a dialog box, the list processor also displays the lists in this window.

-   If the value 0 is specified in dynnr, the current dynpro sequence is closed after the list processor is exited.

¬†¬†¬†¬†INTO¬†¬†@flightdate.
¬†¬†¬†¬†WRITE / flightdate.
¬†¬†ENDSELECT.

Description

This example switches to list processing while processing dynpro 100. The screen layout of dynpro 100 has a single input field, the component CARRID of the structure SDYN\_CONN from ABAP Dictionary. The flow logic of dynpro 100 is:

PROCESS BEFORE OUTPUT.
¬†¬†MODULE status\_0100.
PROCESS AFTER INPUT.
¬†¬†MODULE cancel AT EXIT-COMMAND.
¬†¬†MODULE user\_command\_0100.

In the PAI module user\_command\_0100, CALL SCREEN is used to call dynpro 500. Dynpro 500 encapsulates a basic list. It has the following flow logic:

PROCESS BEFORE OUTPUT.
¬†¬†MODULE call\_list\_500.
PROCESS AFTER INPUT.

The module call\_list\_500 defines the basic list and switches to list processing. After returning from the list display, the system branches to the next dynpro 0, which means that dynpro 500 represents a dynpro sequence with only one dynpro. When list processing is complete, the system goes back to a point after the call point in user\_command\_0100.

If the user selects a line on the basic list, a details list appears. This is done using the event block AT LINE-SELECTION. The program also contains event blocks for TOP-OF-PAGE and TOP-OF-PAGE DURING LINE-SELECTION, which define page headers for both the basic list and details list.

Since there is only one list system in this program, there is no need for case distinctions within the list events.

[Short Reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapleave_to_list-process_shortref.htm)

Syntax

LEAVE TO LIST-PROCESSING *\[*AND RETURN TO SCREEN dynnr*\]*.

Addition:

[... AND RETURN TO SCREEN dynnr](#!ABAP_ONE_ADD@1@)

Effect

This statement can be executed during [PBO](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenpbo_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and [PAI](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenpai_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") processing. After the current dynpro is processed, this statement interrupts the current [dynpro sequence](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendynpro_sequence_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), starts the list processor, and displays the basic list. The basic list consists of any list output of all PBO and PAI modules of the dynpro sequence executed to this point. The statement is ignored in the event blocks for [reporting events](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenreporting_event_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and [list events](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenlist_event_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

The [screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenscreen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the [list dynpro](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenlist_dynpro_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the list processor replaces the screen shown in the [popup level](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenpop-up_level_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") 0. Any modal dialog windows stacked above this are hidden while the list is being displayed. The GUI status set in the dynpro sequence is used. Any list events raised by user actions in the GUI window of the list dynpro call the event blocks of the current [main program](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenmain_program_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). Any details lists created there are displayed by the list processor in the GUI window of the basic list (unless the statement [WINDOW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapwindow.htm) is used).

The user can exit the list processor or list display by selecting the functions Back, Exit, or Cancel in the display for list level 0, or by means of a program that uses the [LEAVE LIST-PROCESSING](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapleave_list-processing.htm) statement. By default, the interrupted dynpro sequence resumes in both cases with the PBO processing of the dynpro in which the list processor was called.

Addition

... AND RETURN TO SCREEN dynnr

Effect

Using the addition AND RETURN TO SCREEN, another dynpro can be specified in dynnr for continuing PBO processing. dynnr expects a character-like data object that contains the number of a dynpro in the current main program.

Hints

-   If the current dynpro is displayed in a dialog box, the list processor also displays the lists in this window.

-   If the value 0 is specified in dynnr, the current dynpro sequence is closed after the list processor is exited.

LEAVE LIST-PROCESSING

[Short Reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapleave_list-processing_shortref.htm)

Syntax

LEAVE LIST-PROCESSING.

Effect

This statement immediately exits the list processor. The runtime environment continues processing with the [PBO](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenpbo_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") event of the dynpro from which the list processor was called using [LEAVE TO LIST-PROCESSING](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapleave_to_list-processing.htm) or the dynpro that was set using the addition [AND RETURN TO SCREEN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapleave_to_list-processing.htm) of this statement.

If the statement is not executed when the list is displayed by the list processor, it is ignored, except in the event blocks for [reporting events](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenreporting_event_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). Here, the processor branches to the end of the program and continues in accordance with the [process flow](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenreporting_process.htm) for executable programs.

When the list processor is exited, the list buffer of the [dynpro sequence](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendynpro_sequence_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is initialized. New output statements describe a new basic list.

Example

This example shows the recommended procedure for displaying lists during dynpro sequences. A separate dynpro 500 is defined for calling the list processor. The [screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenscreen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of this dynpro does not contain any screen elements and calls a single PBO module call\_list but no [PAI](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenpai_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") modules. The full basic list, including the GUI status, is defined in the PBO module. When the dynpro is exited using LEAVE SCREEN, its processing is stopped and the list processor is started. The list events are handled in the same program. When the list processor is exited, the dynpro sequence of dynpro 500 is ended, because the [next dynpro](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abennext_dynpro_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") 0 is specified when the list processor is called.

WINDOW

[Short Reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapwindow_shortref.htm)

Syntax

WINDOW STARTING AT col1 lin1
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† *\[*ENDING¬†¬†AT col2 lin2*\]*.

Effect

This statement initiates the display of the current details list in a dialog box. It only works in the event blocks for an interactive list event. If there are multiple WINDOW statements in an event block, the last one is valid.

The upper left corner is determined for the column and the line by the values in col1 and lin1. The values are based on the GUI window of the basic list. The lower right corner is set automatically. The maximum lower right corner can either be specified in col2 and lin2 or is specified using the lower right corner of the GUI window where the list event took place.

col1, lin1, col2, and lin2 expect data objects of the type i. The values of all data objects should lie within the GUI window of the basic list and the values of col1 and lin1 should be less than those of col2 and lin2. If not, the behavior is undefined.

If no GUI status is set using [SET PF-STATUS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapset_pf-status_list.htm) and an event block is defined using [AT LINE-SELECTION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapat_line-selection.htm) or [AT PFnn](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapat_pfnn.htm), the system automatically uses a [standard list status](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenstandard_list_status_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") suitable for the dialog box without a [menu bar](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenmenu_bar_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and [system toolbar](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenstandard_toolbar_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). This includes pushbuttons for the predefined function codes "PICK" (only for AT LINE-SELECTION), "PRI", "%SC", "%SC+", and "RW" in the [application toolbar](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenapplication_toolbar_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Hint

If a GUI status is set using SET PF-STATUS, this should be created in [Menu Painter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenmenu_painter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") as a dialog box status; the list template should also be included.

Example

Displays the details of an airline in a dialog box after a line is selected.

Description

This program sets status BASIC for the basic list. In the status BASIC, the default function code PICK for the key F2 is replaced by the user-defined function code SELE (text SELECT) and SELE is inserted in the application toolbar.

For this reason, SELECT, F2, and double-clicking with the mouse all raise the event AT USER-COMMAND. In the corresponding processing block, list levels 1 and 2 have the status DIALOG and appear as a dialog box. Like in the status BASIC, the default function code PICK is replaced in the status DIALOG by the function code SELE which is inserted in the application toolbar after Cancel.

Titles WI1 and WI2 are defined for the dialog boxes. In the second dialog box, the function code SELE has been disabled using the addition EXCLUDING in the statement SET PF-STATUS.

The system displays horizontal scroll bars in the dialog boxes since the list width of the dialog boxes is not adjusted and therefore corresponds to the standard width of the basic list.

SET PF-STATUS, List

[Short Reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapset_pf-status_shortref.htm)

Syntax

SET PF-STATUS status *\[*OF PROGRAM prog*\]* *\[*EXCLUDING fcode*\]*
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† *\[*IMMEDIATELY*\]*.

Additions:

[1\. ... OF PROGRAM prog](#!ABAP_ADDITION_1@1@)
[2\. ... EXCLUDING fcode](#!ABAP_ADDITION_2@2@)
[3\. ... IMMEDIATELY](#!ABAP_ADDITION_3@3@)

Effect

In list processing, this statement sets the GUI status specified in status for the display window of the current list, and all subsequent list levels until the next SET PF-STATUS statement. The statement mostly has the same function as for [dynpros](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapset_pf-status_dynpro.htm).

Unlike the [screen layouts](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenscreen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of dynpros, however, every list level is automatically associated with the GUI status that is set for it. If the system returns from displaying a higher list level to a lower list level, the latter is displayed again with the GUI status that was set for it.

If the status of the data object is initial, the standard list status is set and the additions OF PROGRAM and EXCLUDING are ignored. The [standard list status](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenstandard_list_status_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") contains predefined list-specific functions whose functions codes are handled by the runtime environment when a screen list is displayed, and do produce calls of event blocks in the ABAP program. If event blocks are also defined with AT LINE-SELECTION or AT PFnn, further function keys are automatically assigned function codes in the standard list status:

-   If [AT LINE-SELECTION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapat_line-selection.htm) is used, the F2 key and the double-click function of the mouse is assigned the function code "PICK" and the function text Select. This function is then also automatically displayed in the [application toolbar](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenapplication_toolbar_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

-   If [AT PFnn](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapat_pfnn.htm) is used, all the Fnn functions of the keyboard that are not handled by the runtime environment are assigned the function codes "PFnn", where "nn" is a number between 01 and 24.

If the standard list status is set, sy-pfkey is assigned the value "STLI".

Hint

When setting the GUI status for the [list dynpro](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenlist_dynpro_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), it is best to set a GUI status for which a list status has been included as a template status in [Menu Painter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenmenu_painter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). Including this type of template status passes the list-specific functions of the standard list status to a self-defined GUI status.

Addition 1

... OF PROGRAM prog

Addition 2

... EXCLUDING fcode

Effect

As for [dynpros](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapset_pf-status_dynpro.htm).

Addition 3

... IMMEDIATELY

Effect

The addition IMMEDIATELY only has an effect if it is used when creating a details list, that is, within an event block following an interactive list event. The effect of this addition is that SET PF-STATUS has an effect on the current displayed list (sy-listi) and all subsequent list levels, and not only starting from the current details list (sy-lsind).

Example

In the following program segment, it is only possible to select a single line from the basic list by double-clicking the mouse or using the function key F2. This function is then deactivated for the basic list and all subsequent list levels.

START-OF-SELECTION.
¬†¬†SET PF-STATUS 'BASIC'.
¬†¬†WRITE / \`Pick me!\`.
AT LINE-SELECTION.
¬†¬†SET PF-STATUS 'BASIC' EXCLUDING 'PICK' IMMEDIATELY.
¬†¬†WRITE / \`Don't pick me!\`.

SET CURSOR, List

[Short Reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapset_cursor_shortref.htm)

Syntax

SET CURSOR *{* *{* FIELD field LINE line
¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† *\[**\[*DISPLAY*|*MEMORY*\]* OFFSET off*\]* *}*
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† *|* *{* LINE ¬†line *\[**\[*DISPLAY*|*MEMORY*\]* OFFSET off*\]* *}*
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† *|* *{* col lin *}* *}*.

Alternatives:

[1\. ... FIELD field LINE line *\[**\[*DISPLAY*|*MEMORY*\]* OFFSET off*\]*](#!ABAP_ALTERNATIVE_1@1@)
[2\. ... LINE line *\[**\[*DISPLAY*|*MEMORY*\]* OFFSET off*\]*](#!ABAP_ALTERNATIVE_2@2@)
[3\. ... col lin](#!ABAP_ALTERNATIVE_3@3@)

Effect

In list processing, this statement positions the cursor in the next list displayed on the screen. This is either the current list or, if no details list is created in an event block after an interactive event, the previous list. The cursor can be positioned by entering a field after FIELD or a line after LINE, or by entering a specific position using col and lin.

If the statement SET CURSOR is not specified, the cursor is positioned by default in the first field in the list that is ready for input or in the command field in the [standard toolbar](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenstandard_toolbar_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

The statement is ignored if the specified position is outside the display area of the list, or if it points to [line elements](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenline_element_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Hint

The exact position of the cursor is only visible in output areas that are ready for input. Otherwise the whole area in which the cursor is positioned is selected.

Alternative 1

... FIELD field LINE line *\[**\[*DISPLAY*|*MEMORY*\]* OFFSET off*\]*

Effect

The cursor is positioned in the list line specified in line in the output area of the data object whose name is contained in field. The entry is not case-sensitive.

-   If OFFSET is not specified, the cursor is positioned in the first column of the output area.

-   If OFFSET is specified without an addition, or with the addition DISPLAY, the cursor is positioned in the column of the output area entered in off.

-   If OFFSET is specified with the addition MEMORY, the cursor is positioned on the character in the output area that is specified in off in the list buffer in the output of the data object in field. If this character is cut off in the list display, the cursor is positioned on the corresponding indicator (< or >).

The data object field must be character-like and [flat](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenflat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). line and off expect data objects of type i.

If the data object specified in field was contained in the output more than once in the visible area of the line, the cursor is positioned in the first output area. If the data object specified in field does not occur in the visible area of the line, the specification is ignored.

If the cursor is to be positioned in the output area of a data object addressed in the WRITE statement using a field symbol, and the same data object is no longer assigned to the field symbol, the name of the data object must be contained in field, and not the name of the field symbol.

Example

In the following output, the cursor is positioned in the output area ready for input of the field input. Without the SET CURSOR statement, the cursor would be positioned on the previous checkbox.

DATA: flag TYPE c LENGTH 1,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†inp¬†¬†TYPE c LENGTH 10.
SET BLANK LINES ON.
WRITE: / flag AS CHECKBOX, inp INPUT.
SET CURSOR FIELD 'inp' LINE sy-linno.

Alternative 2

... LINE line *\[**\[*DISPLAY*|*MEMORY*\]* OFFSET off*\]*

Effect

The cursor is positioned in the list line specified in line.

-   If OFFSET is not specified, the cursor is positioned in the first column of the row.

-   If OFFSET is specified without an addition, or with the addition DISPLAY, the cursor is positioned in the column entered in off.

-   If OFFSET is specified with the addition MEMORY, the cursor is positioned on the character in the position specified in off in the list buffer. If this character is cut off in the list display, the cursor is positioned on the corresponding indicator (< or >).

line and off expect data objects of type i.

Hint

This variant of the SET CURSOR statement does not work in [screen layouts](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenscreen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Alternative 3

... col lin

Effect

The cursor is positioned in the column specified in col and the line specified in lin in the list window. col and lin expect data objects of the type i. Column numbering begins at 2.

[1\. GET CURSOR FIELD field *\[*field\_properties*\]*.](#!ABAP_VARIANT_1@1@)
[2\. GET CURSOR LINE line *\[*line\_properties*\]*.](#!ABAP_VARIANT_2@2@)

Effect

If this statement is specified in list processing, it passes the name of the output field or the number of the list line on which the screen cursor in the displayed list is positioned (after the user action) to the variables field or line, depending on how FIELD or LINE is specified. Further information on the cursor position can be read if required.

System Fields

sy-subrc

Meaning

0

The cursor is on a field or a list line and the statement was executed successfully.

4

The cursor is not on any field or any list line.

Variant 1

GET CURSOR FIELD field *\[*field\_properties*\]*.

Effect

Returns the name of the displayed field in field after a user action. This name is where the cursor is positioned in the currently displayed list. field expects a character-like variable. The addition [field\_properties](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapget_cursor_list_field.htm) can be used to read further information about the cursor position.

If the screen cursor is on a subarea displayed using an [offset/length](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenoffset_length.htm) of a structure, the following rules apply:

-   The subarea of the structure has been displayed using the name of the structure:

-   If the subarea includes the entire structure, the name of the structure is returned.

-   If the subarea only includes a part of the structure, the name of the component is returned in which the subarea begins.

-   The subarea of the structure has been displayed using the name of a component of the structure:

-   The name of the component is returned in which the subarea begins.

These rules also apply to substructures.

The addition FIELD can only be used to determine the names of global data objects of the ABAP program. If the cursor is positioned on the output of a data object that is not visible in the current context or a literal, field is initialized. This has no affect on the other additions or on sy-subrc.

If the cursor is on the output area of a data object that was accessed in the WRITE statement using a field symbol, the name of the data object is returned and not the name of the field symbol.

Variant 2

GET CURSOR LINE line *\[*line\_properties*\]*.

Effect

Returns the number of the list line in line after a user action. This line is where the cursor is positioned in the currently displayed list. line expects a variable of type i. The addition [line\_properties](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapget_cursor_list_line.htm) can be used to read further information about the cursor position.

Lists - Spool

The "spooling" of lists means the list output is not put in the [list buffer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenlist_buffer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") for [screen lists](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenscreen_list_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), instead it is passed, page by page, to the [SAP spool system](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abensap_spool_system_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). After a page has been passed, it is deleted from the ABAP runtime environment and only exists in the SAP spool system.

The size of a spool list is therefore only limited by the intake capacity of the spool system, and can be very large. On the other hand, when spool lists are created, it is not possible to refer to previous pages.

Each spooling of list output is associated with a [spool request](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenspool_request_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The list pages that are passed to a spool request comprise a [spool list](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenspool_list_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The spool list of a spool request can be

-   kept in the spool system,

-   printed on a printer, or

-   archived using [ArchiveLink](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenarchivelink_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

For the spooling of lists, both the activation and deactivation of spooling and the association with spool requests are important.

Lists - Spooling On and Off

As long as spooling is switched off, all list output is written to the list buffer for the current screen list. When spooling is switched on, a spool list is created. Spooling can be switched on as follows:

-   Use the statement [NEW-PAGE PRINT ON](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapnew-page_print.htm).

-   Choose the function Execute + Print on the [standard selection screen](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenstandard_selscreen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of an executable program.

-   Call an executable program with the addition [TO SAP-SPOOL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapsubmit_list_options.htm) of the statement [SUBMIT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapsubmit.htm).

-   Schedule an executable program in a background job using the additions [VIA JOB](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapsubmit_via_job.htm) and [TO SAP-SPOOL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapsubmit_list_options.htm) of the statement [SUBMIT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapsubmit.htm).

If NEW-PAGE PRINT ON is used, spooling is switched on explicitly in the program. With the other three options, spooling is switched on from the start of execution of an executable program. Switching on spooling opens a new [spool list level](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenspool_list_level_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Only spooling switched on with NEW-PAGE PRINT ON can be switched off again using NEW-PAGE PRINT OFF. Spooling that is switched on at the start of a program cannot be switched off within this same program. In particular, spooling is always switched on when executing a program in [background processing](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbackround_processing_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Lists - Spool List Levels and Spool Requests

Every output to a spool list is assigned to exactly one spool request. For every spool request, [spool parameters](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprint_parameters.htm) have been specified that can no longer be changed. Spool lists can be stacked in spool list levels. A spool list level always has exactly one spool request assigned to it.

Effect

This statement defines an event block whose event is raised by the [ABAP runtime environment](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_runtime_envir_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") when a list is created. This occurs when a new page begins (that is, immediately before the first line on a new page is produced). All list output produced in the event block is placed below the standard page header of the list. It is not possible to produce lines than are available on the page within the event block. The statement [NEW-PAGE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapnew-page.htm) is ignored within this event block.

The entire output written to the list in the event block is part of the [page header](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenpage_header_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current list page. The top page header cannot be moved when scrolling vertically in a list displayed on the screen.

For each TOP-OF-PAGE event, the placeholders "&1" - "&9" are replaced by the content of the system fields sy-tvar0 - sy-tvar9 in the standard heading and the column headings of the standard page header when a basic list is created. Values can be assigned to these system fields in the program.

Addition

... DURING LINE-SELECTION

Effect

If no addition is specified, an event block is raised for the event TOP-OF-PAGE when a basic list is created. If the addition DURING LINE-SELECTION is specified, an event block is raised for the events in question when details lists are created. System fields like sy-lsind must be used to distinguish between the individual details lists.

Description

This program creates a two-page list. In the user-defined page header, column titles are placed in relative position to each other using the system field sy-colno and the POSITION statement. The actual list output is positioned under the fields of the header line using the addition UNDER of the WRITE statement. The line feeds are made using NEW-LINE.

The different output positions of the individual fields result from the ABAP default of representing character strings as left-aligned and numeric fields as right-aligned. The alignment can be adjusted using the formatting options LEFT-JUSTIFIED, RIGHT-JUSTIFIED, and CENTERED of the WRITE statement (see [WRITE - format\_options](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapwrite_to_options.htm)).

TOP-OF-PAGE

[Short Reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abaptop-of-page_shortref.htm)

Syntax

TOP-OF-PAGE *\[*DURING LINE-SELECTION*\]*.

Addition:

[... DURING LINE-SELECTION](#!ABAP_ONE_ADD@1@)

Effect

This statement defines an event block whose event is raised by the [ABAP runtime environment](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_runtime_envir_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") when a list is created. This occurs when a new page begins (that is, immediately before the first line on a new page is produced). All list output produced in the event block is placed below the standard page header of the list. It is not possible to produce lines than are available on the page within the event block. The statement [NEW-PAGE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapnew-page.htm) is ignored within this event block.

The entire output written to the list in the event block is part of the [page header](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenpage_header_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current list page. The top page header cannot be moved when scrolling vertically in a list displayed on the screen.

For each TOP-OF-PAGE event, the placeholders "&1" - "&9" are replaced by the content of the system fields sy-tvar0 - sy-tvar9 in the standard heading and the column headings of the standard page header when a basic list is created. Values can be assigned to these system fields in the program.

Addition

... DURING LINE-SELECTION

Effect

If no addition is specified, an event block is raised for the event TOP-OF-PAGE when a basic list is created. If the addition DURING LINE-SELECTION is specified, an event block is raised for the events in question when details lists are created. System fields like sy-lsind must be used to distinguish between the individual details lists.

[Short Reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapend-of-page_shortref.htm)

Syntax

END-OF-PAGE.

Effect

This statement defines an event block, whose event is raised by the [ABAP runtime environment](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_runtime_envir_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") during the creation of a basic list at the following time:

-   If lines were reserved in the addition [LINE-COUNT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapreport_list_options.htm) of the program-initiating statement for a [page footer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenpage_footer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that was reached by a write operation on this page. List output made in the event block is placed in this area. Output statements that exceed the reserved area are ignored.

-   If no lines were reserved in the addition [LINE-COUNT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapreport_list_options.htm) for a [page footer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenpage_footer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and the end of page was reached by a write operation on this page. List outputs made in the event block have no effect.

Hint

The event END-OF-PAGE is intended for writing list outputs in the page footer and is raised only when the page footer or end of page is reached. Statements such as [NEW-PAGE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapnew-page.htm) do not raise the event.

¬†¬†*|* [PFnn](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapat_pfnn.htm).

Effect

Defines event blocks for interactive list processing. The associated events occur if the screen cursor is positioned on a line in a displayed list and the user chooses an appropriate function. Each interactive list event increases the system field sy-lsind by one.

If the cursor is positioned on a line in a list displayed on the screen in an interactive list event, all the values stored using [HIDE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abaphide.htm) and belonging to the line in question are assigned the respective variables and the following system fields are filled with data:

System Field

Meaning

sy-cpage

Page number of the first displayed page of the list from which the event was raised

sy-cucol

Position of the column in the GUI window from which the event was raised (counting starts with 2)

sy-curow

Position of the line in the GUI window from which the event was raised (counting starts with 1)

sy-lilli

Number of the line from which the event was raised

sy-lisel

Content of the line that raised the event (is limited to the first 255 characters)

sy-listi

Index of the list from which the event was raised

sy-lsind

Index of the list level that was created in the event block

sy-staco

Number of the first column displayed in the list from which the event was raised (counting starts with 1)

sy-staro

Number of the first line of the first page displayed of the list from which the event was raised (counting starts with 1)

sy-ucomm

Function code to which the user action that raised the event is assigned

After each list event AT LINE-SELECTION, AT PFnn, and AT USER-COMMAND, the statement [NEW-PAGE PRINT OFF](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapnew-page_print.htm) is executed explicitly.

Hint

The list event [AT PFnn](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapat_pfnn.htm) is obsolete and the other two list events (preferably [AT USER-COMMAND](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapat_user-command.htm)) should be used instead.

[Short Reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapat_line-selection_shortref.htm)

Syntax

AT LINE-SELECTION.

Effect

This statement defines an event block whose event is raised by the [ABAP runtime environment](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_runtime_envir_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") when a screen list is displayed. This is provided the screen cursor is a list line and a function is selected using the function code PICK. By defining this event block, the [standard list status](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenstandard_list_status_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is enhanced automatically in such a way that the function code F2 and, with it, the double-click mouse functionality is associated with the function code PICK.

Hint

If the function key F2 is associated with a function code other than PICK, each double click raises its event, usually AT USER-COMMAND, and not AT LINE-SELECTION.

Example

If the following section of an executable program is executed with the standard list status, selecting a line with the left mouse key raises the event AT LINE-SELECTION and creates details lists.

START-OF-SELECTION.
¬†¬†WRITE 'Click me!' COLOR = 5 HOTSPOT.
AT LINE-SELECTION.
¬†¬†WRITE: / 'You clicked list', sy-listi,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† / 'You are on list',¬†¬†sy-lsind.
¬†¬†IF sy-lsind < 20.
¬†¬†¬†¬†SKIP.
¬†¬†¬†¬†WRITE: 'More ...' COLOR = 5 HOTSPOT.

Effect

This statement defines an event block whose event is raised by the [ABAP runtime environment](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_runtime_envir_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") if, when a screen list is displayed, a function with a self-defined function code is chosen. The function code is available in the system field sy-ucomm when processing starts.

Self-defined function codes are all those that include character combinations, except for the following:

-   The function codes "PICK" and "PFnn" ("nn" stands for 01 to 24) do not raise the event AT USER-COMMAND, but the events AT LINE-SELECTION and AT PFnn instead.

-   All function codes that start with the character "%" are interpreted as system functions and do not raise the event AT USER-COMMAND. The system functions for lists are listed in the following table 1.

-   The function codes in the following table 2, likewise, do not raise the event AT USER-COMMAND, but are handled by the list processor.

Syntax

AT [LINE-SELECTION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapat_line-selection.htm)
¬†¬†*|* [USER-COMMAND](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapat_user-command.htm)
¬†¬†*|* [PFnn](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapat_pfnn.htm).

Effect

Defines event blocks for interactive list processing. The associated events occur if the screen cursor is positioned on a line in a displayed list and the user chooses an appropriate function. Each interactive list event increases the system field sy-lsind by one.

If the cursor is positioned on a line in a list displayed on the screen in an interactive list event, all the values stored using [HIDE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abaphide.htm) and belonging to the line in question are assigned the respective variables and the following system fields are filled with data:

System Field

Meaning

sy-cpage

Page number of the first displayed page of the list from which the event was raised

sy-cucol

Position of the column in the GUI window from which the event was raised (counting starts with 2)

sy-curow

Position of the line in the GUI window from which the event was raised (counting starts with 1)

sy-lilli

Number of the line from which the event was raised

sy-lisel

Content of the line that raised the event (is limited to the first 255 characters)

sy-listi

Index of the list from which the event was raised

sy-lsind

Index of the list level that was created in the event block

sy-staco

Number of the first column displayed in the list from which the event was raised (counting starts with 1)

sy-staro

Number of the first line of the first page displayed of the list from which the event was raised (counting starts with 1)

sy-ucomm

Function code to which the user action that raised the event is assigned

After each list event AT LINE-SELECTION, AT PFnn, and AT USER-COMMAND, the statement [NEW-PAGE PRINT OFF](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapnew-page_print.htm) is executed explicitly.

Hint

The list event [AT PFnn](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapat_pfnn.htm) is obsolete and the other two list events (preferably [AT USER-COMMAND](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapat_user-command.htm)) should be used instead.

SET USER-COMMAND

[Short Reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapset_user-command_shortref.htm)

Syntax

SET USER-COMMAND fcode.

Effect

Raises a list event with a function code specified in fcode. fcode must be a [character-like data object](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencharlike_data_object_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). This statement can be used when creating a list. After completion, but before display of the current list, the runtime environment responds as if a user action were performed in the displayed list using the function code specified in fcode.

The assignment of list events to function codes corresponds to the description under [AT USER-COMMAND](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapat_user-command.htm):

-   The predefined function codes of the tables specified under AT USER-COMMAND are caught by the runtime environment

-   The function codes "PICK" and "PFnn" raise the events [AT LINE-SELECTION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapat_line-selection.htm) or [AT PFnn](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapat_pfnn.htm)

-   all other functions raise the event [AT USER-COMMAND](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapat_user-command.htm)

If the corresponding event block is implemented, the value of sy-lsind is increased by one and the event block is executed.

If multiple SET USER-COMMAND statements are used when creating a list, all are ignored except the last one.

Hints

-   The function code "PICK" only raises an event if the cursor is positioned on a list line.

-   If a function code is assigned to the Return key in the current [GUI status](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abengui_status_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), this function code is used instead of the one specified in fcode.
    

Example

Creates (program-driven) one basic list and two details lists and displays a search dialog box in the second details list using the predefined function code "%SC". The statement SET CURSOR is used to position the cursor in a list line in the event block AT LINE-SELECTION to enable the function code "PICK".

START-OF-SELECTION.
¬†¬†SET USER-COMMAND 'MYCOMM'.
¬†¬†WRITE 'Basic List'.
AT USER-COMMAND.
¬†¬†CASE sy-ucomm.
¬†¬†¬†¬†WHEN 'MYCOMM'.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†WRITE 'Details List from USER-COMMAND,'.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†WRITE: 'SY-LSIND', sy-lsind.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†SET CURSOR LINE 1.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†SET USER-COMMAND 'PICK'.
¬†¬†ENDCASE.
AT LINE-SELECTION.
¬†¬†WRITE 'Details List from LINE-SELECTION,'.
¬†¬†WRITE: 'SY-LSIND', sy-lsind.
¬†¬†SET USER-COMMAND '%SC'.

Spool Parameters

[Spool parameters](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprint_parameters.htm) are passed from the runtime environment to the spool system in a structure of type PRI\_PARAMS. Before this structure was introduced, [system fields](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abensystem_field_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") were used. When spooling is activated today, a subset of the structure PRI\_PARAMS is still written to system fields of the same name. This information is redundant and should not be used.

The Built-In Structure screen

In [dynpro](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendynpro_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") processing in dialog modules, the built-in data object screen of the data type SCREEN from ABAP Dictionary is available. It can be addressed explicitly there and implicitly in obsolete short forms.

-   [LOOP AT SCREEN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenloop_at_screen_obsolete.htm)

-   [MODIFY SCREEN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenmodify_screen_obsolete.htm)

can be used. A data object screen declared explicitly in the current context hides the built-in structure.

Hints

-   Instead of the built-in structure screen, use explicitly declared work areas of the type SCREEN in the long forms of the statements above.

-   LOOP AT SCREEN INTO screen or MODIFY SCREEN FROM screen should not be used to access the obsolete built-in structure, even in the long forms.

FIELD-SYMBOLS, obsolete\_typing

[Short Reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapfield-symbols_shortref.htm)

Obsolete Syntax

... *{* *}* *|* STRUCTURE struc DEFAULT dobj ...

Additions:

[1\. ... *{* *}*](#!ABAP_ADDITION_1@1@)
[2\. ... STRUCTURE struc DEFAULT dobj](#!ABAP_ADDITION_2@2@)

Effect

These additions of the statement [FIELD-SYMBOLS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapfield-symbols.htm) produce an obsolete typing of the field symbol and are forbidden in classes.

Addition 1

... *{* *}*

Effect

If no explicit type is specified after FIELD-SYMBOLS, the field symbol is typed implicitly with the fully generic type any. Also, the field symbol is assigned the built-in constant space when the context is loaded. This means that the field symbol is not initial directly after it has been declared, and a check using [IS ASSIGNED](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenlogexp_assigned.htm) is true.

Addition 2

... STRUCTURE struc DEFAULT dobj

Effect

If the addition STRUCTURE (which is forbidden within classes) is specified for a field symbol instead of [typing](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abentyping_syntax.htm) and struc is a local program structure (a data object, not a data type) or a [flat structure](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenflat_structure_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") from ABAP Dictionary, this structure is cast for the field symbol <fs>. dobj must be used to specify a data object that is assigned to the field symbol as an initial object.

The field symbol inherits the technical attributes of structure struc as if it were completely typed. In the case of a structured data object dobj, this data object must be at least as long as the formal parameter:

-   In the case of a structured data object, its [fragment view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenunicode_fragment_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") must match the fragment view of the corresponding initial part of struc.

-   An elementary data object must be character-like and flat and the corresponding initial part of struc can contain only components of this type.

The same applies to assignments of data objects to field symbols typed using STRUCTURE when using the statement [ASSIGN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapassign.htm).

Hint

Field symbols declared using the addition STRUCTURE are a mixture of typed field symbols and a utility for [casting](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencast_casting_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") to structured data types. The additions TYPE or LIKE of the statement FIELD-SYMBOLS should be used to type field symbols, while the addition CASTING of the statement ASSIGN is used for casting.

Example

The first example shows the obsolete usage of the addition STRUCTURE.

DATA wa1 TYPE c LENGTH 512.
FIELD-SYMBOLS <scarr1> STRUCTURE scarr DEFAULT wa1.
<scarr1>-carrid = '...'.

The second example shows the replacement of STRUCTURE with the additions TYPE and CASTING.

DATA wa2 TYPE c LENGTH 512.
FIELD-SYMBOLS <scarr2> TYPE scarr.
ASSIGN wa2 TO <scarr2> CASTING.
<scarr2>-carrid = '...'.

ASSIGN LOCAL COPY

[Short Reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapassign_local_copy_shortref.htm)

Obsolete Syntax

ASSIGN LOCAL COPY
¬†¬†OF *{* *{**\[*INITIAL*\]* mem\_area*}*
¬†¬†¬†¬† *|* *{*INITIAL LINE OF *{*itab*|*(itab\_name)*}**}*
¬†¬†¬†¬† *|* *{*MAIN TABLE FIELD (name)*}* *}*
¬†¬†TO <fs> casting\_spec.

Additions:

[1\. ... mem\_area](#!ABAP_ADDITION_1@1@)
[2\. ... MAIN TABLE FIELD (name)](#!ABAP_ADDITION_2@2@)
[3\. ... casting\_spec](#!ABAP_ADDITION_3@3@)

Effect

Obsolete creation of a local data object. This variant of the [ASSIGN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapassign.htm) statement can only be used in [subroutines](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abensubroutine_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and [function modules](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenfunction_module_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The [field symbol](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenfield_symbol_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") <fs> must be declared locally in the procedure.

Like the regular statement [ASSIGN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapassign.htm), the statement ASSIGN LOCAL COPY assigns a memory area mem\_area to the field symbol <fs>. Unlike the regular statement ASSIGN, the field symbol does not reference the memory area specified in mem\_area after the successful assignment. Instead, an [anonymous data object](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenanonymous_data_object_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is created in the local data area of the procedure. After the successful execution of the statement, the field symbol points to the new data object. The new data object is handled as follows:

-   The size of the memory area of the new data object conforms to either the data in mem\_area or the [row type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrow_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of an internal table if LINE OF is specified. The internal table can be specified directly as itab or as the content of a [flat](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenflat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") character-like field itab\_name.

-   The data type with which the new data object is to be handled conforms to the data in casting\_spec as is the case when using the regular ASSIGN.

-   The initial content of the new data object is copied from the memory area specified in mem\_area when specifying mem\_area without the addition INITIAL. Otherwise it is initialized according to type.

Limitation of the memory area [range\_spec](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapassign_range.htm), which can occur in the regular ASSIGN statement implicitly and explicitly, occurs only implicitly in accordance with the rules that also apply to the normal ASSIGN.

Hint

The creation of a local data object using the statement ASSIGN LOCAL COPY is replaced by the statement CREATE DATA with subsequent dereferencing in the regular ASSIGN statement.

Addition 1

... mem\_area

Syntax of mem\_area

... *{* dobj*\[*+off*\]**\[*(len)*\]*
¬†¬†¬†¬†*|* (name)
¬†¬†¬†¬†*|* oref->(attr\_name)
¬†¬†¬†¬†*|* *{*class*|*(class\_name)*}*\=>*{*attr*|*(attr\_name)*}*
¬†¬†¬†¬†*|* dref->\* *}* ...

Effect

The specifications made in mem\_area are a subset of the [specifications](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapassign_mem_area.htm) in the regular ASSIGN statement. They have the same function except for the following restrictions:

-   If the addition INITIAL is used before mem\_area, the data object name must be character-like and [flat](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenflat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

-   If the addition INITIAL is used before mem\_area, the data object dref cannot be typed [generically](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abengeneric_data_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") when using the dereferencing operator \->\*.
    

Addition 2

... MAIN TABLE FIELD (name)

This addition is for internal use only.
It must not be used in application programs.

Effect

This addition is a special form of the specified memory area mem\_area that can only be used in this variant of the ASSIGN statement. It has the same function as the obsolete [TABLE FIELD (name)](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapassign_table_field.htm) in a regular ASSIGN with the exception that the search range is restricted to the current [main program group](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenmain_program_group_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Addition 3

... casting\_spec

Effect

If specified, casting\_spec is the same as a regular [ASSIGN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapassign_casting.htm) with the limitation that if the addition INITIAL is used before mem\_area and an internal tables is specified, no explicit specifications can be made. This means, the field symbol copies the data type of the data object in mem\_area or the line type of the internal table.

Example

A typical use of the statement ASSIGN LOCAL COPY was the creation of a local copy of a global data object.

DATA g\_dobj TYPE i.
...
CLEAR g\_dobj.
PERFORM subroutine1.
...
FORM subroutine1.
¬†¬†FIELD-SYMBOLS <l\_dobj> TYPE ANY.
¬†¬†ASSIGN LOCAL COPY OF g\_dobj TO <l\_dobj>.
¬†¬†<l\_dobj> += 1.
¬†¬†cl\_demo\_output=>write\_data( <l\_dobj> ).
¬†¬†cl\_demo\_output=>display\_data( g\_dobj ).
ENDFORM.

The following subroutine shows how the same functionality can be universally implemented with a data reference.

DATA g\_dobj TYPE i.
...
CLEAR g\_dobj.
PERFORM subroutine2.
...
FORM subroutine2.
¬†¬†DATA dref TYPE REF TO data.
¬†¬†FIELD-SYMBOLS <l\_dobj> TYPE ANY.
¬†¬†CREATE DATA dref LIKE g\_dobj.
¬†¬†ASSIGN dref->\* TO <l\_dobj>.
¬†¬†<l\_dobj> = g\_dobj.
¬†¬†<l\_dobj> += 1.
¬†¬†cl\_demo\_output=>write\_data( <l\_dobj> ).
¬†¬†cl\_demo\_output=>display\_data( g\_dobj ).
ENDFORM.

CALL FUNCTION, IN BACKGROUND TASK

[Short Reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall_function_shortref.htm)

Obsolete Syntax

CALL FUNCTION func IN BACKGROUND TASK
¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† *\[*AS SEPARATE UNIT*\]*
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† *\[*DESTINATION dest*\]*
[parameter\_list](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall_function_background_para.htm).

Addition:

[... AS SEPARATE UNIT](#!ABAP_ONE_ADD@1@)

Effect

Transactional call (tRFC) of a [remote-enabled function module](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenremote_enabled_fm_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") specified in func using the [RFC interface](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrfc_interface_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). Using the addition DESTINATION, a unique [destination](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrfc_destination.htm) can be specified in dest. If the destination is not specified, the destination "NONE" is used implicitly. func and dest expect character-like data objects.

The transactional call registers the name of the called function, together with the destination and the actual parameters passed in [parameter\_list](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall_function_background_para.htm) for the current [SAP LUW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abensap_luw_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in the DDIC database tables ARFCSSTATE and ARFCSDATA of the current [AS ABAP](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenas_abap_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") under a unique transaction ID (abbreviated as TID, stored in a structure of type ARFCTID from ABAP Dictionary, viewed using transaction SM58). After registration, the calling program is continued after the statement CALL FUNCTION.

When the [COMMIT WORK](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcommit.htm) statement is executed, the function modules registered for the current SAP LUW are started in the order in which they were registered. The statement [ROLLBACK WORK](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abaprollback.htm) deletes all previous registrations for the current SAP LUW.

If the specified destination is not available when COMMIT WORK is executed, an [executable program](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenexecutable_program_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") called RSARFCSE is started in [background processing](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbackround_processing_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). By default, this tries to start the function modules registered for a SAP LUW in their destination every 15 minutes and up to 30 times. Changes can be made to these parameters using transaction SM59. If the destination does not become available within the defined time, it is recorded in the DDIC database table ARFCSDATA as the entry "CPICERR". By default, this entry in database table ARFCSSTATE is deleted after eight days.

Hint

[background RFC (bgRFC)](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbg_remote_function_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") executed with the statement [CALL FUNCTION IN BACKGROUND UNIT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall_function_background_unit.htm) is the enhanced successor technology of transactional RFC (tRFC) and makes this technology obsolete. It is strongly recommended to use bgRFC instead of tRFC.

More Information

More information about tRFC can be found in the RFC documentation in SAP Help Portal.

Addition

... AS SEPARATE UNIT

Effect

When using the addition AS SEPARATE UNIT, the relevant function module is executed in a separate [RFC session](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrfc_session_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), in which the global data of the function pool is not affected by previous calls. Each function module that is registered with the addition AS SEPARATE UNIT is given a separate transaction ID. Without the addition AS SEPARATE UNIT, the usual [description](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrfc_context.htm) applies to the [RFC session](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrfc_session_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the called function modules. This means that, when using the same [RFC destination](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrfc_dest_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") for multiple calls of function modules belonging to the same function pool, the global data of this function pool is accessed collectively.

Hints

-   The function module ID\_OF\_BACKGROUNDTASK can be used after a transactional RFC to determine the transactional ID (TID) of the current [SAP LUW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abensap_luw_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
    

-   The transactional RFC (tRFC) is suitable for realizing LUWs in distributed environments (a typical application is ALE). Note that, although the execution of the function modules within a transaction ID is specified, the order of the [LUWs](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenluw_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") on the RFC servers is not necessarily the same as the order of the SAP LUWs on the RFC client. To ensure the same serialization is also used on RFC servers, the tRFC can be enhanced as ([queued RFC (qRFC)](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenqrfc_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")). For this, the function module TRFC\_SET\_QUEUE\_NAME can be called before a transactional RFC. More information about qRFC can be found in the RFC documentation in SAP Help Portal.

-   If [tRFC](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abentrfc_2_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or [qRFC](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenqrfc_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") are registered in a [dialog module](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendialog_module_object_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and are not started with COMMIT WORK, they are not executed by the COMMIT WORK of the caller.
    

-   The new variant [CALL FUNCTION IN BACKGROUND UNIT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall_function_background_unit.htm) ([bgRFC](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbgrfc_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")) includes and enhances the existing tRFC and qRFC variants. For this reason, we strongly recommend using bgRFC instead of tRFC.
    

-   The statements [COMMIT WORK](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcommit.htm) and [ROLLBACK WORK](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abaprollback.htm) must not be executed within a LUW. In addition, no implicit [database commit](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendatabase_commit_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") can be triggered there.
    

-   When handling the registration entries in the DDIC database tables ARFCSSTATE and ARFCSDATA, note that they are subject to the regular administration rules for a [database LUW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendatabase_luw_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). For example, the database LUW is ended by a [database rollback](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendatabase_rollback_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), all registration entries of the current database LUW are deleted.

Obsolete Syntax

... OBJECTS *{*o1 = e1 o2 = e2 ...*}**|*(otab) ...

Effect

This addition of the statement [CALL TRANSFORMATION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall_transformation.htm) can be used to pass object references e1 e2 ... to an XSL transformation as external objects o1 o2 ... to call their methods here.

Instead of using a static parameter list, the objects can be passed dynamically as value pairs in the columns of the internal table otab with the type abap\_trans\_objbind\_tab from the [type pool](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abentype_pool_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") ABAP.

Hint

The addition OBJECTS is obsolete. External objects are handled like parameters and object references must be passed accordingly with the addition [PARAMETERS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcall_transformation.htm).

COMMUNICATION

[Short Reference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcommunication_shortref.htm)

Obsolete Syntax

COMMUNICATION [comstep](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcommunication_comstep.htm) ID id *\[* [cpic\_options](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcommunication_options.htm)*\]*.

Effect

This statement enables cross-system communication between two ABAP programs, or between an ABAP program and a program written in another programming language. The whole communication process takes place in individual communication steps, which involve repeated execution of the COMMUNICATION statement with the corresponding additions [comstep](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcommunication_comstep.htm). For both partner programs, communication is based on the [CPI-C](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencpi-c_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") interface, which has been defined as a communication standard by IBM as a part of the SAA standard. This interface provides the following functions in the form of the CPI-C starter set:

-   Creating, accepting, and closing a connection

-   Sending and receiving data

Coordination of the individual communication steps, recording any errors that occur in the DDIC database table TCPIC and, if necessary, data conversion, take place in the individual programs themselves. The parameters that determined the physical partner system for a connection are administrated in the DDIC database table TXCOM.

Once the connection is initialized, the system writes an eight-digit connection number in the data object id. This number can be used to identify individual connections. As standard, 2\*\*16 connections are possible for each calling program. id expects only [flat](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenflat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") character-like data types, with a minimum length of eight digits.

After initialization, the connection must be created. Then, in the first connection step, all the necessary administration data is sent to the partner system. The data sent in this connection step must have a specific structure and must be available in an [EBCDIC](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenebcdic_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") format. The example below shows how a specifically formed structure can be converted into the EBCDIC format. The subsequent response also exists in EBCDIC format. After this initial connection has been established, data can be transferred without the need for further conversion.

In communications, the [internal session](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeninternal_session_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in the called program must not be changed. Screen output is ignored or, in the case of list output to the SAP spool system, is diverted if the statement NEW-PAGE is entered beforehand. [Messages](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenmessage_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of types I, S, and W are ignored, while types A and E cause the program to terminate.

Hints

-   The statement COMMUNICATION is not supported in classes and should not appear in programs anymore, since support for the direct programming of the CPI-C interface has largely been discontinued. Instead, only the [RFC interface](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrfc_interface_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is to be used for communication between programs. However, the function of the statement is maintained for supporting existing programs and for internal purposes.

-   The EBCDIC format is used in the first connection step because the CPI-C interface was mainly used for connections to R/2 systems.
    

Example

In the simplest case, an ABAP program calls a subroutine in an ABAP program of another [AS ABAP](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenas_abap_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). To enable this, the calling program must register on the other system by specifying the type of CPI-C service, the logon data, the programs and subroutines, and the type of error handling. The registration is performed by sending a specific structure to the other system in EBCDIC format.

The following example shows a schematic representation of the communication between two ABAP programs P1 and P2 without querying return values. The calling program P1 first creates the connection and sends a field connect\_xstr that contains the content of the connect structure converted into EBCDIC format, with the necessary data. After the connection is confirmed by P2, P1 sends the actual, unconverted application data in the buffer b. When this data has been received, P2 sends a confirmation to P1. The connection from P1 is then closed again and the content of the buffer ("Answer") is produced as output.

[6\. ... DEALLOCATE](#!ABAP_ALTERNATIVE_6@6@)

Effect

There are different alternatives for specifying comstep, each of which is responsible for a connection step.

Alternative 1

... INIT DESTINATION¬†¬†dest

Effect

The connection between the programs initialized by specifying dest. dest expects a [flat](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenflat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") character-like data object of the length 8 and, when executing the statement, the data object contains a value from the column SDEST of the DDIC database table TXCOM.

On initialization, the system automatically executes an authorization check on the [authorization object](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenauthorization_object_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") S\_CPIC. The authorization can be checked before the connection is established using the function module AUTHORITY\_CHECK\_CPIC.

Alternative 2

... ALLOCATE

Effect

Establishes a connection to the partner identified in the previous addition DESTINATION. At the same time, a start request is passed to the partner, if it is a program.

Alternative 3

... ACCEPT

Effect

This addition can be used to accept the established connection in a called partner program. After authentication, the called program is in receive status.

Alternative 4

... SEND BUFFER buf

Effect

Sends data to the partner program. A data object can be specified for buf, for which all [flat](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenflat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") elementary types are allowed and the memory requirement of 32000 bytes cannot be exceeded. If the statement COMMUNICATION is executed, the content of buf is passed to the partner program.

Hints

-   A connection step opened with SEND must be followed by a connection step opened with RECEIVE.

-   Information loss, for example as a result of different number formats between the communication partners, is avoided if only character-like types are used for transferring the data. Furthermore, the data is only transferred completely if the sending and receiving buffers have the same structure and length.
    

Alternative 5

... RECEIVE BUFFER buf DATAINFO dat STATUSINFO stat

Effect

Receives data from the partner program. A data object can be specified for buf, for which all flat elementary types are allowed and the memory requirement of 32000 bytes cannot be exceeded. On execution of the statement COMMUNICATION, the content of buf is received by the partner program.

After the execution of the statement, the data object dat contains information about whether the data is sent completely and the content of the data object stat indicates whether the current program is in send or receive mode. Only byte-like data objects are allowed for dat and stat, the length should not be less than 4 bytes. The encoding for the values in dat and stat can be extracted from the [include program](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeninclude_program_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") RSCPICDF. Here, data objects with a descriptive name and [start values](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenstart_value_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") are declared which can be compared with dat and stat.

Hint

A connection step opened with RECEIVE must be followed by a connection step opened with SEND.

Alternative 6

... DEALLOCATE

Effect

The connection is terminated and all memory areas are released.

Effect

This addition can only be specified in the communication steps SEND and RECEIVE. As a result, the data buffer buffer is only sent or received in the length leng. The length leng expects a data object of the data type i.

Addition 3

... RECEIVED rec

Effect

This addition can only be specified for the communication step RECEIVE. The data object rec contains the number of bytes received by the partner program. Only byte-like data objects of length 4 are allowed for rec.

Addition 4

... HOLD

Effect

This addition can only be specified for the communication step RECEIVE. It prevents the [internal session](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeninternal_session_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") being changed when receiving data to avoid the possible loss of the [database cursor](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendatabase_cursor_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). In this case, the current work process waits until all data has been received.

COMMUNICATION [comstep](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcommunication_comstep.htm) ID id *\[* [cpic\_options](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcommunication_options.htm)*\]*.

Effect

This statement enables cross-system communication between two ABAP programs, or between an ABAP program and a program written in another programming language. The whole communication process takes place in individual communication steps, which involve repeated execution of the COMMUNICATION statement with the corresponding additions [comstep](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapcommunication_comstep.htm). For both partner programs, communication is based on the [CPI-C](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencpi-c_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") interface, which has been defined as a communication standard by IBM as a part of the SAA standard. This interface provides the following functions in the form of the CPI-C starter set:

-   Creating, accepting, and closing a connection

-   Sending and receiving data

Coordination of the individual communication steps, recording any errors that occur in the DDIC database table TCPIC and, if necessary, data conversion, take place in the individual programs themselves. The parameters that determined the physical partner system for a connection are administrated in the DDIC database table TXCOM.

Once the connection is initialized, the system writes an eight-digit connection number in the data object id. This number can be used to identify individual connections. As standard, 2\*\*16 connections are possible for each calling program. id expects only [flat](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenflat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") character-like data types, with a minimum length of eight digits.

After initialization, the connection must be created. Then, in the first connection step, all the necessary administration data is sent to the partner system. The data sent in this connection step must have a specific structure and must be available in an [EBCDIC](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenebcdic_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") format. The example below shows how a specifically formed structure can be converted into the EBCDIC format. The subsequent response also exists in EBCDIC format. After this initial connection has been established, data can be transferred without the need for further conversion.

In communications, the [internal session](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeninternal_session_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in the called program must not be changed. Screen output is ignored or, in the case of list output to the SAP spool system, is diverted if the statement NEW-PAGE is entered beforehand. [Messages](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenmessage_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of types I, S, and W are ignored, while types A and E cause the program to terminate.

Hints

-   The statement COMMUNICATION is not supported in classes and should not appear in programs anymore, since support for the direct programming of the CPI-C interface has largely been discontinued. Instead, only the [RFC interface](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenrfc_interface_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is to be used for communication between programs. However, the function of the statement is maintained for supporting existing programs and for internal purposes.

-   The EBCDIC format is used in the first connection step because the CPI-C interface was mainly used for connections to R/2 systems.
    

Example

In the simplest case, an ABAP program calls a subroutine in an ABAP program of another [AS ABAP](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenas_abap_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). To enable this, the calling program must register on the other system by specifying the type of CPI-C service, the logon data, the programs and subroutines, and the type of error handling. The registration is performed by sending a specific structure to the other system in EBCDIC format.

The following example shows a schematic representation of the communication between two ABAP programs P1 and P2 without querying return values. The calling program P1 first creates the connection and sends a field connect\_xstr that contains the content of the connect structure converted into EBCDIC format, with the necessary data. After the connection is confirmed by P2, P1 sends the actual, unconverted application data in the buffer b. When this data has been received, P2 sends a confirmation to P1. The connection from P1 is then closed again and the content of the buffer ("Answer") is produced as output.

ABAP and JavaScript

In the kernel of an AS ABAP, a JavaScript (JS) Engine is integrated, in which execute JavaScript programs can be executed either in normal or in debugging mode (server-side scripting). The JavaScript (JS) Engine used supports JavaScript Version 1.5. Proxies can be used to bind script variables to data objects in ABAP programs.

The class CL\_JAVA\_SCRIPT realizes an API, which can be used in ABAP programs, for the JavaScript (JS) Engine implemented in the kernel. This class encapsulates the JavaScript C Engine API and makes methods and attributes available to the ABAP programmer to perform JavaScript programs.

Hint

Support for the binding of JavaScript to ABAP is scheduled to be stopped. This means that the class CL\_JAVA\_SCRIPT can no longer be used.

Example

The program DEMO\_JAVA\_SCRIPT\_MINI\_EDITOR is an example of a minimal JavaScript editor in which JavaScript programs can be edited, executed, and tested. This program was created using ABAP methods only and uses the class CL\_JAVA\_SCRIPT.

Object-Oriented Programming

Achieving an optimal object-oriented design is not an easy task and this is not the subject of these programming guidelines. It is definitely worth consulting the relevant literature for this topic. The rules below are limited to basic recommendations (for making source codes easier to understand and maintain) and ABAP specifics on working with global and local classes.

Developers who have experience with object-oriented development in other programming languages should be aware of the differences between ABAP Objects and Java:

-   In Java, all superior data objects (especially container variables such as strings) are modeled using classes. By contrast, ABAP provides very powerful, built-in types. Besides the built-in ABAP strings, internal tables are also provided that are used for structured data storage. These tables represent the most powerful ABAP type. Therefore, it is generally not beneficial to implement own container types using ABAP classes.

-   Java reaches a high processing speed for methods, by using optimizations and JIT compilation. In ABAP, however, the high processing speed is primarily attained using very powerful and complex individual statements. This is another reason why implementing own container classes is usually not beneficial. Direct access to a suitable internal table, for example, is always faster than handwritten access logic in ABAP.

Of course, you can transfer algorithms and a general class structure to ABAP, from an application written in another object-oriented programming language. However, the greater the depth, the greater the differences. Therefore, you need to make appropriate modifications to map a detailed design in a different language to ABAP Objects.

Encapsulation

Background

A program that is created based on the procedural programming model and that includes many procedures and global variables is usually difficult to understand because the numerous possible interdependencies of these publicly accessible variables and procedures are difficult to comprehend . The object-oriented approach solves this particular problem by providing visibility sections that are not public. This enables readers who want to get an overview of how the software functions to restrict the overview to the public interfaces of the classes involved. The non-public visibility sections only contain details of the implementation that are not important for a view from the outside.

Of course, this clear overview benefit is only realized in places where the developer makes use of the non-public visibility sections. The same applies to non-public object creation and final classes, where it is becomes immediately clear whether objects can also be generated outside of the class or whether derived classes can exist.

For the development or the design of an application, it is useful to encapsulate as restrictively as possible initially, and to undo the encapsulation only where required.

Rule

Exploit the benefits of encapsulation

Utilize the encapsulation options provided in the form of non-public visibility sections, non-public object creation, and final classes as much as possible. The use of units that are encapsulated in such a way should preferably be free of side effects.

Details

This simple rule provides practical access to object-oriented programming that produces programs that are more robust and more easily maintainable than if you use procedural ABAP, and without a prolonged object-oriented design phase. To use encapsulation appropriately, do the following:

-   Keep the number of public components of a class as small as possible (components that may be private or protected should therefore be created in the corresponding visibility section as well).

-   Declare public attributes only as READ-ONLY.

-   Consider the private instantiation of classes.

-   Mark classes that are not intended as superclasses as [FINAL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeninheritance_guidl.htm "Guideline").

Conversely, within an encapsulated unit, that is, within a class, you should avoid accessing more global data directly. Within methods, you should generally modify attributes of the class only. Performing writes to global data outside the class is not recommended. Accessing data in this way should only be done using specially marked methods, if at all. The use of methods of a class should not evoke any side effects outside the class itself.

Modularization

Background

The main programming model that was propagated before the implementation of ABAP Objects was structured programming:

-   In this model, the programs are split into procedures as appropriate.

-   Sequences, branches, and loops are the only control structures allowed.

The implementation of object-oriented programming languages such as ABAP Objects does not make structured programming obsolete. Object-oriented programming is based on the structured programming and enhances and supplements it.

With regard to ABAP, you must note that ABAP is still a programming language of the fourth generation (4GL) that has been developed especially for application programming in the SAP environment, that is, for mass data processing in business applications. Therefore, ABAP includes significantly more language elements than an elementary programming language in which the more complex functions are usually stored in libraries. This ranges from simple statements for string processing, which are provided as methods of string classes in other object-oriented languages such as Java, to the processing of complex mass data objects, such as internal tables, to very complex statements for operating interfaces such as ABAP SQL or for calling data transformations (XML), for which other languages have entire class hierarchies.

As already [mentioned](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenobj_oriented_guidl.htm "Guideline"), the performance of the ABAP language is therefore optimized mainly for the execution of its complex statements for mass data processing and less for the individual method call.

Rule

Modularize rather than atomize

Modularize your program in classes, but not to the extent that there is an individual method for every trivial function. Methods that consist of only one or just a few statements should be an exception in ABAP and not the rule.

Details

You should only use [methods of ABAP Objects](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_obj_progr_model_guidl.htm "Guideline") for the implementation of functions; there are very good reasons for this. But ABAP remains ABAP, and the good reasons for using a well-structured program are not invalidated by the implementation of ABAP Objects. Indeed, the ABAP language elements proven and tested in so many application cases are still valid today, are undergoing continuously development, and should be used in their present form in ABAP Objects as well.

A well-structured classic ABAP program, for instance a function pool that fulfills a specific task and is modularized using subroutines, should therefore be transferable to a class without any major changes to the implementation, while being provided with all the additional benefits of ABAP Objects.

However, the modularization at the level of a few single statements is and will remain untypical for ABAP. On the one hand this is because of performance reasons, because the costs for the method call must remain low in comparison to the costs for executing the implementation. For example, instead of providing the get\_attribute methods typical for other object-oriented languages that only set their return value to the value of an attribute attribute, you should use public READ-ONLY attributes in ABAP. (If reads on an attribute are associated with further actions, for example, authorization checks, get\_attribute methods are appropriate of course.) On the other hand, virtually all non-fundamental statements of ABAP (all language elements that do not have any equivalent in an elementary language like Java) already play the same role that the methods of system classes assume in other programming languages. The use of a statement like this corresponds to a method call, and another encapsulation is usually not necessary.

Also, for legibility and maintainability reasons, a method with a [reasonable size](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenproc_volume_guidl.htm "Guideline") is preferable to splitting into atomic units, that is, into methods with only one or two statements.

Exception

Procedures that encapsulate nothing but the call of another procedure are an exception. A single procedure call represents the implementation of an entire procedure. This applies in particular to function modules and subroutines, which can only be created in [exceptional cases](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_obj_progr_model_guidl.htm "Guideline") anyway. They should include exactly one [method call](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenfunct_module_subroutine_guidl.htm "Guideline"), which delegates the implementation to ABAP Objects. In this case, the improved security through the stricter checks in ABAP Objects outweighs the disadvantages of very short procedures.

Bad Example

The following source code shows the rudimentary implementation of a string class in ABAP Objects. The methods of this class each contain only a single statement. A consumer must create objects of the class and call the methods to handle the strings.

CLASS cl\_string DEFINITION PUBLIC.
¬†¬† PUBLIC SECTION.
¬†¬†¬†¬† METHODS:
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† constructor IMPORTING value¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†TYPE string OPTIONAL,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† set\_string¬†¬†IMPORTING value¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†TYPE string,

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† shift\_right IMPORTING places¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† TYPE i,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ...
¬†¬†¬†¬†PRIVATE SECTION.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†DATA string TYPE string.
ENDCLASS.

CLASS cl\_string IMPLEMENTATION.
¬†¬† METHOD constructor.
¬†¬†¬†¬† string = value.
¬†¬† ENDMETHOD.
¬†¬† METHOD set\_string.
¬†¬†¬†¬† string = value.
¬†¬† ENDMETHOD.
¬†¬† METHOD get\_string.
¬†¬†¬†¬† value = string.
¬†¬† ENDMETHOD.
¬†¬† METHOD shift\_left.
¬†¬†¬†¬† SHIFT string LEFT BY places PLACES.
¬†¬† ENDMETHOD.
¬†¬† METHOD shift\_right.
¬†¬†¬†¬† SHIFT string RIGHT BY places PLACES.
¬†¬† ENDMETHOD.
¬†¬† ...
ENDCLASS.
...

CLASS application IMPLEMENTATION.
¬†¬†...
¬†¬† METHOD do\_something.
¬†¬†¬†¬† DATA string TYPE REF TO cl\_string.
¬†¬†¬†¬† CREATE OBJECT string EXPORTING value = 'abcde'.
¬†¬†¬†¬† ...
¬†¬†¬†¬† string->shift\_left( ... ).
¬†¬†¬†¬† ...
¬†¬†¬†¬†ENDMETHOD.
¬†¬†...
ENDCLASS.

Good Example

The following source code shows the handling of strings typical to ABAP. A method directly declares a data object of type string and directly uses the corresponding ABAP statements for processing.

CLASS application IMPLEMENTATION.
¬†¬†...
¬†¬† METHOD do\_something.
¬†¬†¬†¬† DATA string TYPE string.
¬†¬†¬†¬† ...
¬†¬†¬†¬† SHIFT string LEFT BY ... PLACES.
¬†¬†¬†¬† ...
¬†¬† ENDMETHOD.
¬†¬†...
ENDCLASS.

There is a corresponding built-in function for almost every string processing statement. They can also be used in operand positions, negating another reason for the encapsulation of statements in methods. The statement SHIFT LEFT in this example can be replaced as follows, whereas shift\_left is a built-in function:

string = shift\_left( val = string places = ... ).

Static Classes and Singletons

Background

The classes of ABAP Objects support two types of components:

-   Instance components (instance attributes, instance events and instance methods). You can only address the instance components of a class using instances of the class (objects).

-   Static components (static attributes, static events and static methods). The static components of a class can be addressed using an object and also using the name of the class. This means they can be used independently of a class instance.

A class that only contains static components and no instance components is referred to as a static class. A global static class is loaded once with its class pool into the current [internal session](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeninternal_session_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). Like every ABAP program, it cannot be explicitly deleted from the session. The static methods (declared using CLASS-METHODS) of a class cannot be redefined in subclasses.

A singleton is a design pattern where the class has the task of creating objects. The class ensures that only one object exists for every internal session that is made available to consumers.

Rule

Do not use static classes

Use objects instead of static classes. If you do not want multiple instantiation, you can use singletons.

Details

If no real object-oriented design exists that would use the multiple instantiation of classes, for example, this often produces classes that only contain static methods (declared using CLASS-METHODS), when [ABAP Objects](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_obj_progr_model_guidl.htm "Guideline") are used. These methods are then used as simple procedures. However, even if multiple instantiation is not explicitly required, object creation is preferable to the use of static classes, for the reasons listed below. You can use the singleton design pattern to prevent multiple instantiation:

-   Explicit object creation is essential for object-oriented programming. Static classes, however, are implicitly loaded the first time they are used, and the corresponding static constructor (if available) is executed. They are persisted in the memory for as long as the current internal session exists. Therefore, if you use static classes, you cannot actually control the time of initialization. You have no way of releasing the memory occupied by the attributes, as soon as the class function is no longer required.

-   Another important argument against the use of static classes are the limited functions of the static constructor, in comparison to an instance constructor. A static constructor has no parameter interface and cannot propagate any [exceptions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenerror_handling_guidl.htm "Guideline"). This is why you cannot always respond appropriately to an error situation in the static constructor, which can cause a runtime error in extreme cases. However, the exceptions of an instance constructor can be handled.

-   By using static classes, you restrict your polymorphism options, which are actually provided by object-oriented programming. On the one hand, you cannot redefine static methods. On the other hand, access is not possible using reference variables (the other pillar of polymorphism). However, it is worth keeping the option of polymorphism open:

-   Even if you initially do not plan to overwrite the behavior of a method later on using inheritance or redefinition, this is a request that frequently arises in the course of the further development.

-   When implementing unit tests with ABAP Unit, redefining the behavior of certain methods, to resolve problematic dependencies, is often unavoidable.

To keep the option of redefinition open, you should always use instance methods instead of static methods.

You can express the retrieval of a singleton object and the subsequent call of an instance method, by using the very compact form of a chained method call:

cl\_singleton=>get\_instance( )->do\_something( ).

Since an additional object reference variable and an additional factory call are omitted, there are no aesthetic disadvantages related to the use of a singleton design pattern.

Exception

Classes that only cover trivial functions can still be implemented as static classes. Here you must accurately assess whether one of the previously mentioned aspects has any effect. The need for a class constructor can be an indicator here. Once a static class requires a nontrivial class constructor to provide the required functions, you should use objects instead.

Bad Example

The following source code shows a static class with purely static methods and how one of these methods is used. In general, it is not immediately obvious from the source code whether the method call also calls the static constructor or whether this has already happened earlier (following a simple attribute access, for example).

CLASS static\_class DEFINITION.
¬†¬†PUBLIC SECTION.
¬†¬†¬†¬†CLASS-METHODS: class\_constructor,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† meth1,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† meth2,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ...
ENDCLASS.
...
static\_class=>meth1( ).
...

Good Example

The following source code shows an implementation of the singleton design pattern. A static method allows access to the only object of the class.

CLASS singleton\_class DEFINITION CREATE PRIVATE.
¬†¬†PUBLIC SECTION.
¬†¬†¬†¬†CLASS-METHODS get\_instance
¬†¬†¬†¬†RETURNING VALUE(r\_instance) TYPE REF TO singleton\_class
¬†¬†¬†¬†RAISING cx\_some\_failure.
¬†¬†METHODS constructor
¬†¬†¬†¬†RAISING cx\_some\_failure.
¬†¬†METHODS: meth1,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† meth2.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ...
¬†¬†PRIVATE SECTION.
¬†¬†¬†¬†CLASS-DATA instance TYPE REF TO singleton\_class.
ENDCLASS.

CLASS singleton\_class IMPLEMENTATION.
¬†¬†METHOD get\_instance.
¬†¬†¬†¬†IF instance IS NOT BOUND.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†CREATE OBJECT instance.
¬†¬†¬†¬†ENDIF.
¬†¬†¬†¬†r\_instance = instance.
¬†¬†ENDMETHOD.
¬†¬†...
ENDCLASS.

...
¬†¬†TRY.
¬†¬†¬†¬† singleton\_class=>get\_instance( )->meth1( ).
¬†¬† CATCH cx\_some\_failure.
¬†¬†¬†¬† ...
¬†¬†ENDTRY.

In the above example, the get\_instance method is used to return the object reference to the object created with the first call. Therefore, this example would appear to violate the rule [modularize rather than atomize](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenmodularization_guidl.htm "Guideline"). This rule states that no method should be created in ABAP that only returns the value of an attribute. However, this objection is not justified here, because the main task of the get\_instance method is to enable the object consumer to control the time of object creation. This is necessary to enable the consumer to respond (in the usual way) to any exceptional situation during the object creation process.

In special cases, where object creation is performed without parameters and is always successful, you can omit the get\_instance method and publish the object reference using a READ-ONLY attribute. In this case, the object is created within the static constructor. Therefore, this approach is still afflicted with some of the problems of static classes described in other sections.

Inheritance

Background

Inheritance is the method by which subclasses are derived from a superclass while inheriting the components of the superclass. A subclass can be made more specific by declaring new components and redefining instance methods. ABAP Objects supports simple inheritance, in which a class can have multiple subclasses but only one direct superclass. (Despite this, the interface concept does enable something like multiple inheritance to take place, at least with respect to attributes and method declarations. Method implementations, on the other hand, are not inherited when an interface is included.) This creates an inheritance hierarchy in an inheritance tree, with a unique path running from each subclass to a root class. In ABAP Objects, all classes are subclasses of the predefined abstract root class object. Final classes (classes defined using the addition FINAL) close the bottom of a path in the inheritance tree.

Rule

Avoid using deep inheritance hierarchies

Avoid using deep inheritance hierarchies, since they are often difficult to maintain.

Details

Deep inheritance hierarchies are examples of successful reuse, but are also the source of maintenance problems, due to the complexity inherent in the large number of classes involved.

-   The behavior of classes deep down in the inheritance hierarchy is difficult to predict, since they potentially inherit from a large number of methods.

-   Classes with a lot of subclasses exert great affect on the system as a whole, making the consequences of modifications to a superclass hard to predict.

-   A large number of subclasses may also indicate an unsuitable level of abstraction.

To prevent unintended reuse of your classes by inheritance, we recommend that you use final classes to close the paths of inheritance trees.

Note

If your main aim is to exploit the possibilities of polymorphism, interfaces are often a preferable solution to inheritance. If all you want to do is use interfaces, method interfaces should be used instead of abstract classes. These can be used to create composite interfaces. In ABAP, on the other hand, a composite interface is impossible due to the nature of simple inheritance using classes.

Class References and Interface References

Background

Interface components in objects can be addressed using a class reference variable or an interface reference variable. If you use a class reference variable, the interface component is addressed using the name of the interface and the interface component selector (~). If you use a suitable interface reference variable, the component is addressed directly using its name.

Rule

Address interface components using interface reference variables

From outside a class, only access its interface components using a relevant interface reference variable; do not use the interface component selector (~).

Details

Accessing interface components externally using an interface reference variable makes code easier to understand because it is clear that the user of the class is interested in exactly the aspect provided by the interface. Accessing interface components using a class reference variable, on the other hand, suggests that components are used that are not provided by an interface. As a rule, only use the interface component selector within classes and interfaces, to address the interfaces included there. If you want to provide an interface component of an included interface as a separate component, you can declare an alias name by using ALIASES.

Bad Example

The following source code shows an interface method call using a class reference variable and the interface component selector (~); this is not recommended, as mentioned in the rule above.

CLASS cl\_class DEFINITION PUBLIC.
¬†¬†PUBLIC SECTION.
¬†¬†¬†¬†INTERFACES if\_intf.
¬†¬†...
ENDCLASS.
...
¬†¬†¬†¬†DATA cref TYPE REF TO cl\_class.
¬†¬†¬†¬†...
¬†¬†¬†¬†cref->if\_intf~meth( ).
¬†¬†¬†¬†...

Good Example

The following source code shows the method call from the above example, but using an interface reference variable. Instead of cref->if\_intf~meth, iref->meth is used to express that components of a class are accessed that are on the same hierarchy level as all public components, but in another part of the public interface.

CLASS cl\_class DEFINITION PUBLIC.
¬†¬†PUBLIC SECTION.
¬†¬†¬†¬†INTERFACES if\_intf.
¬†¬†¬†¬† ...
ENDCLASS.
...
¬†¬†¬†¬† DATA iref TYPE REF TO if\_intf.
¬†¬†¬†¬† ...
¬†¬†¬†¬† iref->meth( ).
¬†¬†¬†¬† ...

Local Types for Global Classes

Background

Within [class pools](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenclass_pool_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), as in virtually any other ABAP program, data types, local interfaces, and local classes can be defined to ensure a better structure of the implementation of the global class. From a technical point of view, these optional declaration parts, together with the declaration part of the global class, form the global declaration part of the [class pool](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenglobal_declar_guidl.htm "Guideline").

These local declarations in a class pool are invisible outside the class pool, which means they can only be used as followed:

-   In the private visibility section (PRIVATE SECTION) of the declarations in the global class

-   Within the method implementations in the global class

These two usage types have different technical visibility requirements because friends of a global class have access to its private visibility section. Local type declarations that are used in the PRIVATE SECTION must therefore be accessible for any possible friends of the class, whereas those type declarations that are only used within the method implementations are completely meaningless for other classes.

In general, local classes consist of the declaration part and the associated method implementations. These are invisible to the friends of the global class and have thus technically the same visibility requirements as local type declarations that are only used within the implementation.

Local data types, interfaces, and classes within a class pool are saved in dedicated include programs. The following two areas are distinguished:

-   Class-relevant local definitions

-   Local definitions and implementations (Local types in [ADT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenadt_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")).

These areas match the different technical visibility requirements. The internal names of the include programs end with CCDEF or CCIMP, which is why they are also known as [CCDEF includes](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenccdef_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and [CCIMP includes](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenccimp_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Rule

Position local declarations appropriately

Position the local declarations of a class pool at appropriate positions depending on the requirements. Types that are only used within the implementation of the global class need to be in a different position than types that are also addressed in the PRIVATE SECTION of the global class.

Details

From the perspective of a class pool, all local type definitions and the associated implementations of local classes can be saved in the [CCDEF include](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenccdef_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). However, such an approach is disadvantageous from the dependency management perspective. Dependent classes (subclasses and friends of the global class) only have to be invalidated for changes to the local type declarations of a class pool that are used in the PRIVATE SECTION of the global class. But technically speaking, this invalidation occurs for all changes in the [CCDEF include](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenccdef_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). For this reason, the additional [CCIMP include](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenccimp_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") exists which is intended for local type declarations that are only used within the class implementation of the global class, and for the implementation part of local classes. If this area is changed, dependent classes are not invalidated.

To prevent unnecessary new generations of other classes that are based on unwanted technical dependencies, the class-local types must be defined in the class pool at the appropriate positions after changes have been made to the global class:

-   All types used only within the method implementations of the global class should be declared in the [CCIMP include](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenccimp_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The local classes should be implemented here as well.

-   Only those types that can also be referenced in the PRIVATE SECTION should be defined in the [CCDEF include](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenccdef_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Declarations and implementations of a local class are only supposed to be distributed across the CCDEF include and the CCIMP include if they are to be referenced in the PRIVATE SECTION. However, if the local class is only used within the implementation of the global class, both the declaration and the implementation are to be carried out in the CCIMP include.

Note

The rule specified here specializes the general rule [implement global declarations centrally](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenglobal_declar_guidl.htm "Guideline") with respect to class pools. They are especially oriented toward the external call of methods of their respective global class and are therefore particularly integrated within a dependency network. For this reason, the rule just mentioned cannot apply to its full extent.

Hint

[Test classes](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abentest_class_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") should only be created in [test includes](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abentest_include_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Instance Constructor

Background

When you define an ABAP class, you specify who creates an instance of this class or who may access the instance constructor of the class. To do this, you use the addition CREATE of the statement CLASS ... DEFINITION. The addition CREATE PUBLIC is the default setting and allows for the instantiation by any user of the class. By specifying CREATE PROTECTED, you can restrict the object creation to the class itself and its subclasses. Using the addition CREATE PRIVATE addition, objects can only be created by the class itself. The restriction of the object creation to the class itself is useful in connection with the [singleton design pattern](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenstatic_class_singleton_guidl.htm "Guideline"), for example, where the class itself performs the object creation.

From a technical point of view, the instance constructor can be declared in all visibility sections that are more general or equal to the instantiation specified in the addition CREATE of the statement CLASS ... DEFINITION, using the statement METHODS constructor. However, the actual visibility is controlled by the addition CREATE.

Rule

Declare the instance constructor in the public visibility section.

Always declare the instance constructor of a global class in its public visibility section and independently of the instantiation specified by the addition CREATE in the class definition.

Details

The components of global classes are stored internally, separated according to the visibility section they belong to. Depending on the usage type of the class, only parts of the class are respected by ABAP Compiler in compilations. This procedure requires that the constructor of a global class is always declared in the public visibility section of the class. For these technical reasons, the instance constructor of a global class is always supposed to be declared in the public visibility section (PUBLIC SECTION). If it is declared in another visibility section, this may produce unjustified syntax errors in individual cases when global classes are used.

Exception

The technical restrictions mentioned only apply to the processing of global classes. Within local classes, the instance constructor can also be defined in other visibility sections. However, this positioning should correspond with the visibility section specified using the addition CREATE. A strategy like this enables you to use types for the interface of the instance constructor of a local class that are only accessible in a restricted visibility section.

User Interfaces

The user interface is the interface between a (human) user and a machine, in this case between the user and the ABAP program that is running. In the ABAP environment, graphical user interfaces (GUIs) are used which can be operated using a keyboard, mouse, or other input devices. They are based on assorted interface technologies and use either SAP's own SAP GUI or are Web-based technologies that create HTML pages displayed using Web browsers.

Selecting the User Interface Technology

Background

Various UI technologies can be used in the ABAP environment. We distinguish between classic technologies, which are based on the SAP GUI and are almost completely integrated into the ABAP language, and new Web-based technologies, which display the UI in a Web browser and are accessed through object-oriented interfaces in ABAP.

The classic SAP GUI technologies are:

-   Classic dynpros
    A classic dynpro is a component of an ABAP program. It is created using Screen Painter in ABAP Workbench and called using either a transaction code or the CALL SCREEN statement. Every time a dynpro is called, a dynpro sequence is started.

-   Selection screens
    A selection screen is a specific classic dynpro that is not created manually in Screen Painter. Instead, it is defined using the ABAP statements PARAMETERS, SELECT-OPTIONS, and SELECTION-SCREEN. A selection screen is called either implicitly when executable programs are started or explicitly using the CALL SELECTION-SCREEN statement.

-   Classic lists
    Classic lists are used to output data in a structured and formatted manner. The formatted data is stored in a list buffer using specific ABAP statements (such as WRITE, FORMAT) and displayed on a special system dynpro. Classic lists are called either automatically (when an executable program is run) or with the LEAVE TO LIST-PROCESSING statement.

The new Web-based technologies are:

-   Business Server Pages
    Business Server Pages (BSP) are the counterpart to JavaServer Pages (JSP). BSPs are HTML pages with content that is partly dynamic. The dynamic content is created by server-side scripts that are written in ABAP. In AS ABAP, this type of script occurs as a generated ABAP Objects class. You create Business Server Pages using Web Application Builder in ABAP Workbench.

-   Web Dynpro ABAP
    Web Dynpro ABAP is a technology for creating platform-independent, Web-based interfaces. The architecture of Web Dynpro is based on the Model View Controller approach (MVC) for [SoC](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenseperation_concerns_guidl.htm "Guideline"). The three components of the model view controller are the data model, which describes the application, the presentation view, and the program controller for responding to user actions. Web Dynpro applications are created using Web Dynpro Explorer in ABAP Workbench and appear in AS ABAP using generated ABAP Objects classes.

-   SAPUI5
    SAPUI5 is a tool set for developing user interfaces for Web applications in HTML5. SAPUI5 supports the Model View Controller (MVC) approach and based on the user interface elements delivered in JavaScript and CSS libraries. The data connection to the application server is established using the data formats [XML](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenxml_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), [JSON](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenjson_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or OData. User interfaces developed with SAPUI5 can be connected to SAP and non-SAP platforms. In particular, SAPUI5 user interfaces can be developed for ABAP applications of [AS ABAP](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenas_abap_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The connection is established using [ICF](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenicf_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and [APC](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenapc_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Rule

Use Web Dynpro ABAP or SAPUI5

Use Web Dynpro ABAP or SAPUI5 whenever possible to create the UIs of new application programs.

Details

Web Dynpro ABAP and SAPUI5 are SAP's standard UI technologies for developing modern Web applications in the ABAP environment. The MVC approach automatically ensures a separation of presentation logic and application logic, based on the [SoC principle](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenseperation_concerns_guidl.htm "Guideline").

Compared to Web Dynpro, the BSP technology is much more fundamental. An MVC approach for the SoC is supported, but developers are still responsible for the implementation. BSPs can be regarded as the predecessor technology of Web Dynpro ABAP. The use of BSPs is now restricted to cases where a Web application is based on a single HTML page, for which scripting is required and the function cannot be implemented with Web Dynpro ABAP.

The classic SAP UI technology (classic dynpros based on the SAP GUI, including selection screens and lists) is no longer sufficient for modern and flexible business applications where the user interface must be accessible in a portal, for example. The MVC approach is not supported by frameworks or by any relevant tools.

Exception

The various UI technologies are not interoperable. In other words, it is usually not possible to switch parts of an application based on classical dynpros (including selection screens and classic lists) to Web Dynpro ABAP or SAPUI5. In addition, the commonly implemented dynpro programming model was previously not very oriented toward SoC. This makes it difficult or even impossible to implement a changeover for the purpose of further development. Consequently, in exceptional cases, classic dynpros and/or selection screens might be required if a new development needs to be included in an existing framework. For these exceptional cases, the following rules have been devised to ensure that these obsolete UI technologies are handled using a more modern approach.

Hints

-   In general, the UI technology of an application that is strictly modeled on the [separation of concerns](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenseperation_concerns_guidl.htm "Guideline") can be replaced without any problems (see example below).

-   Web Dynpro ABAP and SAPUI5 are not part of the ABAP language. Specific guidelines regarding their use are not in the scope of these programming guidelines, which focus mainly on using the ABAP language to implement services.

Example

The transaction DEMO\_CR\_CAR\_RENTAL is called. Now two user interfaces can be selected for a car rental example:

-   A UI based on classic dynpros and selection screens. However, according to the above rule, using this UI technology in application programs is no longer recommended.

-   A modern UI based on Web Dynpro ABAP

Since the example application strictly separates all concerns, you can use it with different UIs without having to make adjustments to the application and persistence logic. The SoC is therefore a critical prerequisite for potential changeovers from classic dynpros to Web Dynpro ABAP.

Encapsulating Classic User Interfaces

Background

The [separation of concerns](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenseperation_concerns_guidl.htm "Guideline") is one of the basic rules of these ABAP programming guidelines. This separation, which refers to a strict division of ABAP code into parts for presentation services, application services, and persistence services, is also technically possible for classic dynpro-based UI technologies. The MVC approach is not directly supported, but SoC can also be achieved through the consistent use of the available encapsulation technologies.

However, SoC was rarely implemented in classic dialog programming. Here, presentation logic, application logic, and persistence logic were often combined in a monolithic module pool.

Rule

Encapsulate classic dynpros and selection screens

Only create classic dynpros and selection screens in programs in a logical layer specifically provided for this purpose. You can use function pools as the program type.

Details

When using classic UI technologies, you need to separate the display logic from the application logic for the following reasons:

-   Reuse individual components

-   Automated program logic tests, irrespective of the UI

-   Change the UI technology

In addition, the communication between classic dynpros or selection screens and ABAP programs is implemented using global variables. This poses conceptual problems and cannot be combined with a modern, object-oriented approach for application programs.

Since class pools do not support classic dynpros and selection screens, you can only use function pools for encapsulation. In this role, a function pool must be considered a global class. Here, the data of the global declaration part assumes the role of the private attributes, and the function modules assume the role of the public methods. The relevant procedure is demonstrated in DEMO\_CR\_CAR\_RENTAL\_SCREENS of package SABAP\_DEMOS\_CAR\_RENTAL\_DYNPRO. It applies to selection screens.

Besides UI elements, these function pools can only contain display logic in the form of local classes. The application logic communicates with the display logic using the function modules of this function pool. You can still call the first dynpro of a dynpro sequence using a transaction code. This method is used in cases where the user starts the application.

The guidelines described in this book are also valid in function pools. It is especially important that the [dialog modules](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendial_mod_event_block_guidl.htm "Guideline") (PBO and PAI), which are called by the dynpro, or the [event blocks](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendial_mod_event_block_guidl.htm "Guideline") for selection screen processing do not contain any program logic. Instead they should directly delegate the processing to the relevant methods of the local classes. The same applies to the [function modules](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenfunct_module_subroutine_guidl.htm "Guideline") that act as the external interface. In addition, you must [restrict](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenselect_table_type_guidl.htm "Guideline") the scope of the function pool global data to the minimum scope required for communicating with dynpros.

Exception

Following the above rule means you cannot use standard selection screens. Therefore, it is necessary to make an exception to this rule for executable programs that are executed during background processing. This is because the required parameter interface must be a standard selection screen defined directly in the program. An encapsulation in a function pool is not possible here. However, in this case, the events of selection screen processing should only call one appropriate method of a local class within the executable program.

Bad Example

A classic dialog program - usually a single module pool - processes all the facets of an application.

Good Example

The following source code shows a part of a function pool DEMO\_CR\_CAR\_RENTAL\_SCREENS with expanded include programs. This function pool encapsulates the dynpro and selection screen for transaction DEMO\_CR\_CAR\_RENTAL, following the above rule. The connection to the application layer is established exclusively using the if\_demo\_cr\_car\_rentl\_service interface, which is also used in the Web Dynpro application of this transaction.

Lists

Background

A list is a medium used for the structured and formatted output of data. The following lists are available in ABAP:

-   Classic lists, which are written to a list buffer using ABAP statements and displayed on a special list dynpro.

-   Output of the SAP List Viewer (ALV), which is displayed in [GUI controls](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abengui_control_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") during the processing of classic dynpros. ALV lists are accessed using classes, such as CL\_SALV\_TABLE (non-hierarchically tabular lists), CL\_SALV\_HIERSEQ\_TABLE (hierarchically sequential lists), or CL\_SALV\_TREE (hierarchically tabular lists).

Classic lists are the only option to send ABAP data from ABAP programs directly to the SAP spool system as print lists. If SAP List Viewer is used, the lists that are displayed in the viewer are automatically converted to classic print lists during printing.

Rule

Use SAP List Viewer

Do not use classic lists. If dynpro-based, classic UI technologies are still used, SAP List Viewer (ALV) or other GUI control-based technologies should be used instead of classic lists in production programs.

Details

Using classic lists is no longer recommended for the following reasons:

-   The processing of lists is based on global data and events of the ABAP runtime environment.

-   The list buffer that is used for classic lists is bound to an executable program or a dynpro sequence and not to classes and objects.

-   It is almost impossible to separate presentation logic and application logic when writing to lists.

-   The UI of a classic list is not standardized and thus usually not accessible.

The concept of classic lists is therefore mostly incompatible with the ABAP Objects concept, and classic lists cannot be encapsulated in function pools as easily as classic dynpros and selection screens.

While the application developer must ensure [accessibility](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenaccessibility_guidl.htm "Guideline") in classic lists with a great deal of effort, the ALV lists automatically comply with the accessibility requirements because the ALV already provides the required services, such as user-specific settings.

Exception

Small helper programs that are not intended for live use in application systems can continue to use classic lists for system-related console output. The WRITE list statement here assumes the same role as System.out.println(...) in Java or printf in C.

In cases in which an ALV output seems to be overdimensioned, other methods are possible, such as Textedit Control or Browser Control (or its wrapping in dynamic documents) for the formatted output of non-tabular content. As before, accessibility must be guaranteed here.

Hint

For simple console output, XML-based output streams can be used. An example of this is shown by the class CL\_DEMO\_OUTPUT\_STREAM. The class CL\_DEMO\_OUTPUT demonstrates possible applications of this class. It is used in programs in the [ABAP Example Library](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_examples.htm).

Bad Example

Executing the program DEMO\_CLASSICAL\_REPORTING produces a classic list output. However, according to the above rule, using classic lists in application programs is no longer recommended.

Good Example

Executing the program DEMO\_ALV\_REPORTING produces ALV lists with the same content and the same functions as the classic lists in the previous example. ALV lists replace classic lists in those cases in which classic dynpros are still used.

Accessibility

Background

Accessibility is a [product standard](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencorrectness_quality_guidl.htm "Guideline") that ensures that information technology products can also be used by people with impairments. For user interfaces, for instance, this means meeting the needs of visually impaired or blind users in particular. These users usually need a screen reader program, which reads the content of the screen aloud.

Rule

Ensuring Accessibility

Make sure that your user interfaces are accessible, no matter what interface technology is used, so that they can be used by users with impairments.

Details

Primarily, user interfaces must be designed so that they can be processed by technologies such as screen readers or magnifiers. This means meeting the following requirements:

-   All input and output fields must have meaningful labels.

-   All table columns must have a header.

-   All icons must have a tooltip.

-   Information must not be expressed by color alone.

-   Input and output fields on the screen should be grouped as appropriate in frames, each with a meaningful title.

This is another reason to use the most up-to-date interface technologies, such as SAPUI5, Web Dynpro ABAP or ALV. These automatically only allow accessible interfaces, whereas application developers using older technologies such as classic screens or classic lists are themselves responsible for ensuring that the accessibility requirements are met. There are some checks in the [check tools](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abencheck_correctness_guidl.htm "Guideline") for classic dynpros and selection screens that report violations of these rules (if they can be identified statically). However, for classic lists such checks are only possible at the time of display.

Hint

As regards using the browser control in classic dynpros, we refer here to the class CL\_HTMLTIDY. This class enables HTML files to be checked for formal correctness and accessibility. It is best to only display HTML files in a browser control if they have been checked by CL\_HTMLTIDY. The class CL\_ABAP\_BROWSER, which wraps the browser control for simple displays of HTML files, performs a check with CL\_HTMLTIDY by default.

Data Types and Data Objects

Together with classes and objects, data types and data objects are the essentials of ABAP programming.

-   Data type

A data type describes a data object, just as a class describes an object. In this sense, a data type is comparable with a class without methods. ABAP interprets the content of a data object in accordance with its data type. Data types exist either as attributes bound to data objects or as standalone data objects. Standalone data types can be defined either in ABAP Dictionary or using the statement TYPES in an ABAP program.

-   Data object

A data object is an instance of a data type, just as an object is an instance of a class. It exists in the [internal session](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeninternal_session_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of an ABAP program or as a shared object in the shared memory and occupies memory there for the contained data. A data object is created either implicitly when a program or procedure is loaded (named data object), or by using the statement CREATE DATA (anonymous data object). Named data objects are either variables (statements DATA, CLASS-DATA, and so on) or constants (statement CONSTANTS).

A data type describes the technical attributes of a data object (for example, the elementary types it is comprised of, its length) and semantic attributes (what type of entity is represented by the data object). Types that are defined in ABAP dictionary have additional attributes, for example for input/output on a classic dynpro or in Web Dynpro.

As far as the ABAP runtime environment is concerned, only the technical attributes of a data object are of interest for program execution. However, the semantic information, which is linked to the appropriate use of types, is essential for the legibility of the source code. For this reason, some of the rules covered in this section could also fall under the heading [Structure and Style](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenstructure_style_guidl.htm "Guideline"), since this covers not only robustness, but also good style, which, although it does not affect program execution, is nevertheless significant for readability and maintainability.

Bound and Standalone Data Types

Background

A bound data type only exists as an attribute of a data object. It is created when a data object is not declared using a reference to a standalone data type that defines all technical attributes, but when technical attributes are defined in the statement DATA instead. Here DATA is used as a synonym for all statements that declare data objects. The resulting type is an attribute of the declared variable and it is bound to this variable. If this type is needed in several different places, it has to be defined separately for each place where it is used.

A standalone data type is declared in the ABAP Dictionary or using the statement TYPES and defines all technical attributes of a data object with one exception: When table types are defined, they can be generic with respect to the keys specified. A standalone generic type can only be used for typing but not for data declarations. However, there is one exception: In a DATA statement, the standard key is added to the generic standard table type.

Rule

Use standalone data types

Use standalone data types instead of constructing bound data types when declaring data objects.

Details

Here is a list of reasons that support the declaration of standalone types:

-   The declaration of a standalone data type allows multiple data objects (or interface parameters or field symbols) to use a type without the need to always redefine this type.

-   Even if only one data object of this type is required initially, it is very likely that further data objects will be added during the course of the development. If the type needs to be adapted later on, you can do this centrally.

-   Declaring a standalone type and using it to declare a data object is nothing more than following the rule for the [SoC principle](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenseperation_concerns_guidl.htm "Guideline").

The data type should always have a specific meaning and a meaningful [name](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abennaming_guidl.htm "Guideline"). This gives data types a clear semantic meaning and makes the program easier to read and understand. Therefore, you should declare different data types for technically identical but semantically different data objects. This also increases the probability that a type can be adapted later on without making major program changes.

Therefore you should avoid declaring purely technical data types that cannot be associated with specific semantics, because this does not make it easier to read or enhance the program.

Hint

A separate [rule](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendeclaration_dtypes_const_guidl.htm "Guideline") specifies where the standalone data types should be declared.

Bad Example

The following source code shows the declaration of two data objects that are supposed to have the same data type. However, the technical attributes, length, and number of decimal places are defined as standalone, bound data types in the DATA statements in question.

...
DATA number\_1 TYPE p LENGTH 6 DECIMALS 2.
DATA number\_2 TYPE p LENGTH 6 DECIMALS 2.
...

Good Example

The following source code moves the definition of the technical attributes of the data objects in the above example to a separate TYPES statement. The standalone data type is only declared once and can then be used multiple times.

TYPES number\_type TYPE p LENGTH 6 DECIMALS 2.
...
DATA: number\_1 TYPE number\_type,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†number\_2 TYPE number\_type.
...

Declaration of Data Types and Constants

Background

Data types and constants can be declared in the following contexts:

-   Cross-program

-   in the ABAP Dictionary

-   in global classes and interfaces

-   in type pools

-   Local program

-   in the global declaration part of a program

-   in global classes and interfaces

-   in procedures ([Methods](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenfunct_module_subroutine_guidl.htm "Guideline"))

Technically speaking, type pools, global classes and interfaces are also ABAP programs, in which data types and constants are created using the TYPES and CONSTANTS statements. In contrast to other ABAP programs, the declarations can also be statically visible in other programs, depending on the visibility section. Absolute type names enable you to dynamically access the types of all programs.

Rule

Declare data types and constants in the appropriate context

Declare data types and constants in the context that guarantees the best possible encapsulation.

Details

Data types and constants should be declared in the context in which they are [visible](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenencapsulation_guidl.htm "Guideline") for all potential consumers but not anywhere else:

-   Local program data types and constants

-   Data types that are only required by local data objects (usually helper variables) or constants that are only required in a procedure ([method](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenfunct_module_subroutine_guidl.htm "Guideline")) should be declared as local data types or constants.

-   Data types and constants that are only required within local classes should be declared in the corresponding visibility section of the classes or integrated using an interface.

-   If data types are required in multiple local classes and interfaces of a program, they should be created in the appropriate visibility section of a local class or an interface. Local classes or interfaces can be used that contain nothing else apart from these types or constants. In the global declaration part of programs, declarations of data types or constants are not required for semantic reasons.

-   Cross-program data types and constants

-   Data types and constants that a consumer requires to use a class or interface should be declared in the public visibility section of the global class or interface. Examples include data types used to type interface parameters of methods, and constants expected as actual parameters by methods, such as IDs of [exception texts](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenexception_texts_guidl.htm "Guideline") in exception classes.

-   Data types required by different programs, classes, or interfaces are declared as real types of the ABAP Dictionary (not in type pools). These are usually semantically independent types, for which the ABAP Dictionary provides additional services, such as descriptive texts and documentation options. In this context, you must consider the [separation of concerns](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenseperation_concerns_guidl.htm "Guideline").
    For example, a structure of the ABAP Dictionary should never be used to type (Web) Dynpro fields and to simultaneously define a database table. Ideally, data types should be declared in encapsulated packages, which manage the cross-package use of their repository objects and which only expose types actually required outside the package in their package interfaces.
    You should generally avoid declaring or even exposing purely technical types without semantic meaning, in application development packages of the ABAP Dictionary. The declaration of these types (such as INT2 or CHAR10) should be restricted to fundamental basis packages.

-   You should not create any new type pools. Data types should be declared in global classes or interfaces, or as real types of the ABAP Dictionary. You should only create constants in global classes or interfaces. However, the use of existing type pools is still [allowed](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendataobjects_true_value_guidl.htm "Guideline"). It is no longer necessary to load type pools explicitly using the TYPE-POOLS statement. However, you only need to declare new types or constants in a context, if no [semantically appropriate](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenusing_types_guidl.htm "Guideline") types or constants exist that are more global. For example, if an appropriate ABAP Dictionary data type exists, it is not necessary to create a local data type in the class, to type an interface parameter of a global class method. In this case, the data type in the ABAP Dictionary might have to be published in the same package interface as the class. This would also be the case, however, if an interface parameter is typed with a data type of the class that refers to an ABAP Dictionary data type.

Note

The misuse of include programs for the declaration of data types and data objects that can be reused across various programs is [not allowed](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenmultiple_use_include_guidl.htm "Guideline").

Bad Example

The following source code shows the declaration of constants in a type pool that are required across different programs. The name of the type pool must precede the names of the constants as a prefix. You should not create any new [type pools](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprogram_type_guidl.htm "Guideline"). For constants that are required in various different programs, the above rule recommends a declaration in global classes or interfaces.

TYPE-POOL zicon.
¬†¬†TYPES zicon\_icon TYPE ...
¬†¬†CONSTANTS:
¬†¬†¬†¬†zicon\_cancel¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†TYPE zicon\_icon VALUE icon\_cancel,

¬†¬†¬†¬†zicon\_download¬†¬†¬†¬†TYPE zicon\_icon VALUE icon\_export,
¬†¬†¬†¬†...

Good Example

The following source code illustrates the declaration of the constants in the above example in a global class. The visibility of the constants is restricted to the current package. In other programs, the constants are addressed using cl\_...\_icons=>.

Declaration of Variables

Background

Variables can be declared in the following contexts:

-   As attributes of global classes and interfaces across programs

-   Locally in the program

-   in the global declaration part of a program

-   as attributes of local classes and interfaces

-   in procedures ([Methods](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenfunct_module_subroutine_guidl.htm "Guideline"))

Variables that are declared within most of the event blocks or dialog modules as well as between completed processing blocks also belong to the global declaration part of a program, but violate the rule [implement global declarations centrally](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenglobal_declar_guidl.htm "Guideline").

Program-local variables that are declared in the global declaration part of a program are generally referred to as global variables.

Rule

Do not declare global variables

Do not declare variables in the global declaration part of a program. Variables may only be declared as attributes of classes and interfaces or locally in methods.

Details

This rule is directly derived from the basic rule [use ABAP objects](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenabap_obj_progr_model_guidl.htm "Guideline"). If you disregard helper variables in procedures ([methods](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenfunct_module_subroutine_guidl.htm "Guideline")), the content of the variable of a program indicates the state of the program and consequently the state of an application. In object-oriented programming, the class replaces the program, and the state of an application is no longer the state of the programs but the state of the classes or objects.

Furthermore, the rule [exploit the benefits of encapsulation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenencapsulation_guidl.htm "Guideline") also assumes a critical role. The data of an application is sufficiently protected from misuse only in the visibility sections of classes.

Except for the following exception, you should not declare any global variables in a new ABAP program. They indicate a poor programming style that disregards proven concepts such as task sharing and encapsulation. If you need to access the same data of a program from multiple local classes and interfaces, you must create them in an appropriate visibility section of a local class or an interface. These can also be local classes or interfaces that contain nothing but such attributes.

Hint

The above rule also applies to the declaration of [field symbols](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendyn_access_data_obj_guidl.htm "Guideline") with the FIELD-SYMBOLS statement.

Exception

If classic dynpros and selections screens are still used instead of [SAPUI5](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeninterface_tech_guidl.htm "Guideline") or [Web Dynpro ABAP](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abeninterface_tech_guidl.htm "Guideline"), global variables are required as interfaces for the communication between ABAP and classic dynpros. Global variables can be declared using the following statements for this purpose alone:

-   DATA, [TABLES](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abentable_work_area_guidl.htm "Guideline") and CONTROLS for general dynpros

-   PARAMETERS and SELECT-OPTIONS for selection screens

In these cases, you have to ensure the maximum possible [encapsulation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenencap_class_interf_guidl.htm "Guideline") of those global variables.

Bad Example

The following source code shows the top include of a function pool for document display. In addition to the required interface work area, which is declared with TABLES, further global variables exist that indicate the state of the display. However, according to the above rule, you are not allowed to use global variables for purposes other than communication with a classic dynpro.

FUNCTION-POOL show\_documents.
TABLES document\_structure.
DATA: g\_language TYPE sy-langu,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†g\_display\_mode TYPE ...
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†...
CLASS screen\_handler DEFINITION.
¬†¬†PUBLIC SECTION.
¬†¬†¬†¬†...

Good Example

The following source code shows an improved example. The previously global variables are encapsulated in a class that is specifically provided for the state of the display, and can be addressed using display\_status=> in the other classes of the program.

FUNCTION-POOL show\_documents.
TABLES document\_structure.
CLASS display\_status DEFINITION.
¬†¬†PUBLIC SECTION.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†CLASS-DATA: language TYPE sy-langu,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†display\_mode TYPE ...

Inline Declarations

Background

The declaration operators

-   [DATA(var)](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendata_inline.htm)

-   [FIELD-SYMBOLS <fs>.](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenfield-symbol_inline.htm)

can be used to make inline declarations in [write positions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenwriting_position_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). In this way, declarations are made in operational statements rather than in [declaration statements](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendeclaration_statement_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The declaration is made when the program is compiled, regardless of whether the statement is actually executed.

Rule

Only use inline declarations locally

Only make inline declarations in processing blocks that support [local data](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenlocal_data_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). Use them as if they were local declarations in the current statement block.

Details

If used correctly, inline declarations are an excellent way of making programs leaner and easier to understand. An inline declaration in a statement works like a short form of a declaration statement directly in front of the statement, which is why the guidelines for declaration statements must be followed:

-   The rule dictating that [no global program variables and field symbols](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendeclaration_variables_guidl.htm "Guideline") are to be declared also applies to inline declarations, without restrictions. For this reason, statements with inline declarations should only be specified in processing blocks with local data, namely procedures and preferably methods. If not, the variables and field symbols declared inline would be global in the program, with all the drawbacks listed in the description of the rule.

-   Inline declarations are an exception to the rule that [local declarations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenlocal_declar_guidl.htm "Guideline") should only be made at the start of a procedure. They are specified in operational statements, which means that, unlike declaration statements, they cannot be specified at the start of the procedure. Despite this, the restrictions stated in the rule for local declarations are still valid for inline declarations. In particular, the validity of inline declarations is not limited to their current statement block. Inline declarations should, therefore, only be specified in less complex procedures, so making them easier to understand. The variables and field symbols declared inline should only be used in the direct vicinity of their declaration. Under no circumstances should a variable declared inline be accessed dynamically before the declaration. When an inline declaration is specified in a (conditional) control structure, it should usually only be accessed within this statement block.

Bad Example

Inline declaration of a field symbol <pattern> and two variables moff and mlen in a LOOP and their later reuse in a different loop. At first glance, it appears that the declarations are only valid in the first loop and only conditionally, but they are valid for the whole method and unconditionally.

METHOD demo\_method.
¬†¬†"IMPORTING i\_tab1 TYPE TANDARD TABLE OF string
¬†¬†"IMPORTING i\_tab2 TYPE TANDARD TABLE OF string
¬†¬†"IMPORTING i\_text TYPE string
¬†¬†IF i\_tab1 IS NOT INITIAL.
¬†¬†¬†¬†LOOP AT i\_tab1 ASSIGNING FIELD-SYMBOL(<pattern>).
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†FIND <pattern> IN i\_text MATCH OFFSET DATA(moff)
¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† MATCH LENGTH DATA(mlen).
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†...
¬†¬†¬†¬†ENDLOOP.
¬†¬†ENDIF.
¬†¬†IF i\_tab2 IS NOT INITIAL.
¬†¬†¬†¬†LOOP AT i\_tab2 ASSIGNING <pattern>.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†FIND <pattern> IN i\_text MATCH OFFSET moff
¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† MATCH LENGTH mlen.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†...
¬†¬†¬†¬†ENDLOOP.
¬†¬†ENDIF.
ENDMETHOD.

Good Example

The field symbols and variables declared inline are only used locally in the their respective loops. The fact that they are valid in the whole method is ignored, for the sake of simplicity. If the field symbol and the variables are only to be declared once for both loops, they should be declared at the start of the method using declaration statements.

METHOD demo\_method.
¬†¬†"IMPORTING i\_tab1 TYPE TANDARD TABLE OF string
¬†¬†"IMPORTING i\_tab2 TYPE TANDARD TABLE OF string
¬†¬†"IMPORTING i\_text TYPE string
¬†¬†IF i\_tab1 IS NOT INITIAL.
¬†¬†¬†¬†LOOP AT i\_tab1 ASSIGNING FIELD-SYMBOL(<pattern1>).
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†FIND <pattern1> IN i\_text MATCH OFFSET DATA(moff1)
¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†MATCH LENGTH DATA(mlen1).
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†...
¬†¬†¬†¬†ENDLOOP.
¬†¬†ENDIF.
¬†¬†IF i\_tab2 IS NOT INITIAL.
¬†¬†¬†¬†LOOP AT i\_tab2 ASSIGNING FIELD-SYMBOL(<pattern2>.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†FIND <pattern2> IN i\_text MATCH OFFSET DATA(moff2)
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†MATCH LENGTH DATA(mlen2).

¬†¬†¬†¬†ENDLOOP.

ENDMETHOD.

Including Structures

Background

In the program-internal design of structures with the BEGIN OF and END OF additions of the TYPES and DATA statements, you can use the INCLUDE TYPE or INCLUDE STRUCTURE statements to integrate all components of another structure with the current structure at this place without creating a specific substructure. You can specify a name for shared addressing and a suffix to avoid naming conflicts. ABAP Dictionary provides the same functions.

Substructures, in contrast, are formed if the components of a structure themselves are structured. A structure with substructures is known as a nested structure.

Rule

Do not include components from structures

Do not integrate the components of other structures by using INCLUDE when declaring a structure. If required, you can include the components in a real substructure.

Details

The reasons for this rule are the following:

-   The integration of components can lead to naming conflicts. This is particularly problematic if structures of other contexts are integrated and changed retroactively.

-   Although it is possible to assign a name, the integrated structures cannot be addressed as such without restrictions. The necessary internal type information is individually stored for each integrated component. For the components of a substructure, however, this information is stored only once for the substructure

-   In contrast to real substructures, structures integrated using INCLUDE cannot be declared as boxed components. A boxed component is a structured component, which is managed through an internal reference and thus supports initial value sharing. This can considerably reduce the memory requirements for rarely filled components.

-   The statement cancels a [chained statement](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenchained_statements_guidl.htm "Guideline") that has been created with BEGIN OF and END OF.

If no real substructures can be formed, you must avoid naming conflicts as far as possible by using suffixes (RENAMING WITH SUFFIX addition). This recommendation also applies to the integration of structures in ABAP Dictionary, where you cannot always create real substructures (for example, for database tables).

Bad Example

The following source code shows the integration of the components of a structure into another structure, which is not recommended according to the above rule.

TYPES:
¬†¬†BEGIN OF structure\_1,
¬†¬†...
¬†¬†END OF structure\_1.
TYPES:
¬†¬†BEGIN OF structure\_2,
¬†¬†...
¬†¬†INCLUDE TYPE structure\_1 AS sub\_structure.
TYPES:
¬†¬†¬†¬†...
¬†¬†END OF structure\_2.

Good Example

The following source code shows the declaration of a component of a structure as a substructure as recommended in the above rule.

TYPES:
¬†¬†BEGIN OF structure\_1,
¬†¬† ...
¬†¬†END OF structure\_1.
TYPES:
¬†¬†BEGIN OF structure\_2,
¬†¬†¬†¬†...
¬†¬†¬†¬†sub\_structure TYPE structure\_1.
¬†¬†¬†¬†...
END OF structure\_2.

Using Types

Background

You can use the data types declared according to the rules on [Bound and Standalone Data Types](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbound_independent_dtype_guidl.htm "Guideline") and [Declaration of Data Types and Constants](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendeclaration_dtypes_const_guidl.htm "Guideline") for declaring and creating data objects, as well as for typing field symbols or interface parameters. You specify them after the TYPE addition of the corresponding statement.

Rule

Use semantically appropriate data types only

Use existing types only if they match the semantics of the typed object. You must not select an existing type based only on the technical attributes.

Details

As long as it extends beyond an elemental ABAP type, the type of a data object or an interface parameter provides the source code reader with information about the semantics of these variables. This makes it easier to recognize the meaning of individual variables.

For this reason, you must use only data types whose semantics match the usage. The technical attributes of a type alone do not justify its use in a specific context, as this impedes the readability of the program.

In particular, this applies to the reuse or multiple use of existing types. If you require a data type with specific technical attributes for an application, you should not simply use any type with these attributes from ABAP Dictionary. In the past, this has frequently been the chosen procedure. Consequently applying package encapsulation may help prevent the unwanted use of own data types.

Hint

This rule applies especially for the use of structures from ABAP Dictionary. For example, you should never use a structure defining a database table as a template for input or output fields of classic dynpros or in Web Dynpro. This would violate the [SoC principle](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenseperation_concerns_guidl.htm "Guideline").

Bad Example

In the following source code a variable is declared, whose name and use clearly indicate that it is used for a truth value. The variable is declared with a technically correct, but semantically incorrect, data type. syst-batch, after all, is the data type for the [system field](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abensystem_fields_guidl.htm "Guideline") sy-batch, which indicates whether a program is executed in the background.

DATA is\_empty TYPE syst-batch.
...
IF is\_empty IS INITIAL.
¬†¬†...
ENDIF.

Good Example

The following source code shows an improved example compared to the source code above. In this case, the abap\_bool type of type pool abap, which is intended for [truth values](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abendataobjects_true_value_guidl.htm "Guideline"), is used. In addition, the request of the truth value is performed using a specifically designated constant from the same type pool.

DATA is\_empty TYPE abap\_bool.
...
IF is\_empty EQ abap\_false.
¬†¬†...
ENDIF.

Reference to Data Types or Data Objects

Background

As well as [using data types](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenusing_types_guidl.htm "Guideline") for declarations and typings with the addition TYPE, the alternative addition LIKE of the corresponding statements can be used to reference the data type of one of the data objects visible at this position directly. This includes references to data objects of the same program, interface parameters of the current procedure, attributes of global classes and interfaces, and constants in type pools.

Rule

Declare dependent data objects with reference to other data objects

If a data object directly depends on another data object, refer to it directly using LIKE for the declaration. In all other cases, use TYPE to refer to a standalone data type.

Details

For example, if a helper variable of the type of an input parameter is required within a procedure ([method](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenfunct_module_subroutine_guidl.htm "Guideline")), it should not be declared with reference to the type of the parameter using TYPE but with reference to the parameter itself using LIKE. It is also possible to declare work areas using LIKE LINE OF if the parameter is an internal table. In the case of typing with LIKE, the type of the parameter can be changed retroactively without always having to adapt the procedure implementation.

However, if no close reference to another data object exists, it is usually more useful to declare data objects with reference to a [standalone data type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenbound_independent_dtype_guidl.htm "Guideline") by using TYPE.

Hint

Obsolete references to flat structures or database tables or views of the ABAP Dictionary using LIKE should never be implemented.

Bad Example

The following source code shows the declaration of a helper variable in a method that is supposed to be of the same data type as an interface parameter. The TYPE reference to the data type requires a manual implementation of any type changes.

CLASS some\_class DEFINITION ...
¬†¬† PUBLIC SECTION.
¬†¬†¬†¬† METHODS some\_method
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† CHANGING some\_parameter TYPE some\_type.
¬†¬†¬†¬† ...
ENDCLASS.
CLASS some\_class IMPLEMENTATION.
¬†¬† METHOD some\_method.
¬†¬†¬†¬† DATA save\_parameter TYPE some\_type.
¬†¬†¬†¬† save\_parameter = some\_parameter.
¬†¬†¬†¬† ...
¬†¬† ENDMETHOD.
¬†¬† ...

Table Work Areas

Background

Table work areas are structured data objects of a flat structure type, a database table type, or a view type from ABAP Dictionary declared using the statements TABLES or NODES. If declared using NODES, other ABAP Dictionary types are also possible.

From the perspective of the data type, the statements

[TABLES table\_wa](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abaptables.htm).

[NODES table\_wa](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapnodes.htm).

are the same as

DATA table\_wa TYPE table\_wa.

This means that data objects with the same name and type as the corresponding data types from ABAP Dictionary are declared. This is supplemented by further meanings of TABLES and NODES. For the full range of meanings, refer to their documentation. The essential properties are as follows:

-   TABLES and NODES declare [interface work areas](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenintern_extern_proc_call_guidl.htm "Guideline"), which are shared by multiple programs of a program group.

-   TABLES declares interfaces to classic dynpros and selection screens.

-   NODES declares an interface to logical databases.

In addition, it is also possible to use table work areas declared using TABLES as implicit work areas in obsolete abbreviated forms of ABAP SQL, or even older statements for database accesses.

Rule

No table work areas except for classic dynpros

Only use the statement TABLES in the global declaration part of function pools to communicate with classic dynpros. Apart from in wrappers of logical databases, the statement NODES is no longer required.

Details

The statement TABLES is not allowed within classes anyway and, in the syntax, the statement NODES can only be created in the global declaration part of an executable program associated with a logical database. The latter option is [no longer allowed](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenprogram_attribute_guidl.htm "Guideline").

Since obsolete database accesses requiring the statement TABLES and shared data areas between programs are not allowed, there is no need to use the statement TABLES, except for declaring interfaces to classic dynpros (see the following exception).

Exception

If dynpro fields in [classic dynpros](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenuser_interfaces_guidl.htm "Guideline") are defined with reference to flat structures in ABAP Dictionary, the identically named global data objects of the ABAP program must be declared with the statement TABLES. Otherwise, the data objects of the ABAP program are not linked to the dynpro fields, and their content cannot be accessed. In addition, TABLES is also required for declaring specific work areas when handling function codes of selection screens.

Note

The restriction on the statement TABLES to this last remaining technical requirement, that is, the communication with classic dynpros and selection screens, can also be derived from other rules of these guidelines. However, since the use of the statement TABLES instead of the statement DATA is still very popular among experienced ABAP developers, the rule above explicitly stresses that it is not allowed.

Literals

Background

A literal is a data object defined in the source code of a program by specifying a character-like value. Possible literals are:

-   Numeric literals
    String of digits with an optional sign. The data type is either i or p.

-   Character literals

-   Text field literals enclosed in single quotation marks ('). The data type is c.

-   String literals, which are enclosed in backquotes (\`). The data type is string.

In numeric literals, neither decimal separators nor scientific notation with mantissa and exponent are possible. Character literals with [correct content](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abennumbers_guidl.htm "Guideline") must be used to represent these types of numeric values.

Rule

Avoid using literals in operand positions

Avoid using literals to specify values directly in the source code. Instead constants should be declared with these values. This applies to numeric values in particular.

Details

Certain values are required in more than one place in the source code. It is therefore not helpful to specify these values directly in the source code, since multiple statements would need to be modified each time the value is changed. An appropriate constant can be used instead to enable the value to modified at a central position in the source code. Literals are, of course, allowed when specifying values in the declaration of the constants. This can make the program significantly easier to maintain and enhance at a later date.

It can also be a good idea to create an appropriate constant for values used in only one place. The name of the constant gives the values semantics that make the source code easier to understand.

Numeric literals that appear in source code seemingly without any semantic meaning are often known as "magic numbers". Avoid using these in ABAP programs. When using character literals, [translatability](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abensystem_text_guidl.htm "Guideline") is also important.

Exception

In certain situations, however, using constants can affect the readability of a program. It is better to specify a literal in these cases, as in the following examples:

-   CALL FUNCTION 'MY\_FUNC'.

-   IF sy-subrc = 0.

-   READ TABLE itab INDEX 1 or itab\[ 1 \]

-   ADD 1 TO counter.

These examples make the semantic meaning of the literals clear and translatability is not an issue.

Another area where character literals are vital is dynamic programming. Here, parts of statements or entire programs are generated, which is virtually impossible without using character literals. In addition, string templates offer various enhanced options for using literal texts.

Hint

If literals are used, ensure that literals are actually used, not equivalent expressions:

-   Numeric literal +*|*\-literal instead of arithmetic expression +*|*\- literal

-   Text string literal \`...\` instead of string expression |...|

The expressions are not evaluated until runtime, meaning that they have a lower performance. This distinction is irrelevant only if the literals are parts of expressions anyway.

Bad Example

The following source code uses the same literal multiple times to specify pi in operand positions. This multiple use makes the program unclear and error-prone.

DATA: radius TYPE decfloat34,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†circumference TYPE decfloat34,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†area TYPE decfloat34.
...

circumference =
¬†¬†2\* '3.141592653589793238462643383279503' \* radius.
area =
¬†¬†'3.141592653589793238462643383279503' \* radius \*\* 2.

Good Example

The following source code declares a constant that requires the literal the value of pi only once, and uses it in the respective operand positions.

CONSTANTS pi TYPE decfloat34
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† VALUE '3.141592653589793238462643383279503'.

DATA: radius¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†TYPE decfloat34,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†circumference TYPE decfloat34,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†area¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†TYPE decfloat34.
...
circumference = 2 \* pi \* radius.
area¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†= pi \* radius \*\* 2.

Strings

Background

Strings are [dynamic data objects](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenuse_dyn_data_object_guidl.htm "Guideline") of variable length. There are text strings of the string data type and byte strings of the xstring data type, in which character strings or byte strings can be saved.

In contrast to text and byte fields of a fixed length (c, x data types), the length of strings automatically adapts to the content. Other data types, such as n, d, and t, are also handled as text fields in many operand positions. Strings are deep data objects that are internally managed by references. For this, the following additional memory is required:

-   Strings whose length is less than approximately 30 characters or 60 bytes require between approximately 10 and 40 bytes of additional memory, depending on the string length.

-   For longer strings, the additional memory requirement is approximately 50 bytes, irrespective of the string length.

In the case of assignments between strings, sharing takes effect. This means that only the internal reference is copied first. Sharing is canceled if the source or target object is accessed for modification.

Rule

Use strings in character string and byte string processing

Use strings rather than fixed length fields for the internal saving and processing of character strings and byte strings.

Details

Strings are more flexible than fields of a fixed length and usually help to save memory space, because no unnecessary space is occupied by blanks or zeros, and because sharing is implemented for assignments. Furthermore, trailing blanks are always significant in text strings. Text fields simply ignore trailing blanks in many operand positions (but not in all), which may be quite confusing at times.

Exception

In the following cases, fields of a fixed length should be used instead of strings:

-   The length of the field is critical, for example, for templates or for interfaces to screen fields.

-   Despite [sharing](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenadmin_costs_dyn_mem_obj_guidl.htm "Guideline"), the additional administration work outweighs the benefits which can often be the case for very short strings. If it is obvious that a certain length is never exceeded, short fields of a fixed length can also be used.

-   Structures that only contain character-like components should be handled like a single text field. This is not possible for structures that contain text strings.

Bad Example

The following source code shows an internal table for saving an HTML page whose line type is a text field with a fixed length of 255. Most of the memory space of the internal table, however, is probably wasted on blanks.

TYPES html\_line TYPE c LENGTH 255.
DATA html\_table TYPE TABLE OF html\_line.
APPEND '<HTML>' TO html\_table.
...
APPEND '<BODY>' TO html\_table.
...
APPEND '</BODY>' TO html\_table.
APPEND '</HTML>' TO html\_table.

Good Example

The following source code shows the above example but uses text strings. The memory space gained should outweigh the additional administration effort considerably. As an alternative to using an internal table, the HTML page can also be concatenated in a single text string; however, this makes it more difficult to read, for example, in the ABAP Debugger.

DATA html\_table TYPE TABLE OF string.
APPEND \`<HTML>\` TO html\_table.
...
APPEND \`<BODY>\` TO html\_table.
...
APPEND \`</BODY>\` TO html\_table.
APPEND \`</HTML>\` TO html\_table.

Start Values

Background

If you declare a data object with the statement DATA, you can use the addition [VALUE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapdata_options.htm) to set a value, with which the data object is filled when it is created. If the addition VALUE is not used, the system uses the type-dependent initial value. If the statement CONSTANTS is used, the addition VALUE must always be specified. If the type-dependent initial value is required here, this can be achieved using the addition VALUE IS INITIAL. The addition [DEFAULT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abapmethods_parameters.htm) for input parameters of methods is a further option for start values.

If the specified start value does match the type and length of the data object, the value is converted when the program is generated.

Rule

Start values must match the data type of the data object

Only use the addition VALUE to enter start values that exactly match the data type of the declared data object in terms of type, content, and length.

Details

The start value cannot always be specified in a type-compliant way, since ABAP does not support type-compliant [literals](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenliterals_guidl.htm "Guideline") for all possible data types. In all cases where a conversion cannot be avoided, choose the content of literals specified as start values so that the actual value meets the requirements when the source code is read.

Hint

If a start value cannot be converted to the data type of the data object, no syntax error occurs and program generation is canceled at activation time instead. Non-convertible start values for input parameters of methods, in fact, are not detected until the method is called. This can only occur, however, when literals are specified.

Bad Example

The average reader may well expect the constant high\_noon in the following source code to contain the value 120000. However, the constant actually contains the value 092000, because the value of the numeric literal refers to the number of seconds. This means 12,000 seconds is actually the time 09:20 on the following day.

CONSTANTS high\_noon TYPE t VALUE 120000.

Good Example

The following source code corrects the above example by replacing the numeric literal with a text field literal. Now the constant high\_noon contains the expected value 120000.

CONSTANTS high\_noon TYPE t VALUE '120000'.

Data Objects for Truth Values

Background

Truth values are results of logical expressions. A truth value is either true or false. ABAP does not yet support Boolean data types and thus does not support data objects for truth values. Therefore, the result of a logical expression cannot be assigned directly to a data object.

It has become common practice to express the truth value "true" as value "X" and the truth value "false" as a blank (" "). There are also Boolean functions that have a logical expression as an argument and are returned as the value "X" or a blank, depending on the result.

To make it easier to handle truth values expressed in this way, the type pool abap contains a data type abap\_bool of elementary type c with length 1, and the constants abap\_true of value "X" and abap\_false of value " " as substitutes for a real Boolean data type. There is also a constant abap\_undefined of value "-".

Rule

Use the data type abap\_bool for truth values

When working explicitly with truth values, use the type abap\_bool as a substitute for a real Boolean data type. A data object declared in this way should have no values other than the relevant constants abap\_true and abap\_false (also abap\_undefined).

Details

Using the type abap\_bool and the constants abap\_true and abap\_false makes it clear that truth values are being used here.

In accordance with the rule for [avoiding](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenliterals_guidl.htm "Guideline") literals in operand positions, not only the literals 'X' and ' ' should be used. State queries about the [predicate operators](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_755_index_htm/7.55/en-US/abenpredicate_operator_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") IS INITIAL and IS NOT INITIAL or the use of the constant space are also not advisable, because they require knowledge of the technical values of abap\_true and abap\_false, which are not significant in the sense of real Boolean data objects.

The type pool abap contains a third constant for the type abap\_bool, namely abap\_undefined. However, implementing a three-value logic is only useful and recommended in exceptional cases. In this case, note that abap\_undefined does not contain the initial value for a variable of type abap\_bool. The initial value is always the value of abap\_false. However, the value of abap\_undefined can, if required, be specified using the addition VALUE when declaring a truth value as the start value.

Bad Example

The following source code shows an unsuitable emulation of the Boolean data objects not present in ABAP.

DATA is\_found TYPE c LENGTH 1.
...
is\_found = 'X'.
...
IF is\_found IS NOT INITIAL.
¬†¬† ...
ENDIF.

Good Example

The following source code shows the recommended emulation of the Boolean data objects not present in ABAP.

DATA is\_found TYPE abap\_bool.
...
is\_found = abap\_true.
...
IF is\_found = abap\_true.
¬†¬† ...
ENDIF.
