ABAP Objects - Overview

ABAP Objects is the object-oriented part of ABAP.

ABAP Objects adds a complete set of [language elements](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenobjects_keywords.htm) to ABAP, which was previously only a procedural language, that allow [object-oriented programming](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenobject_orientation.htm). This object-oriented extension of ABAP is based on the previous languages scope and is largely compatible with them. ABAP Objects can be used in existing programs, and the [statements](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenabap_objects_statements.htm) that can be used in ABAP Objects correspond to almost all of the remaining ABAP language scope, although certain [obsolete language elements](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenabap_objects_strict.htm) are not allowed in the context of ABAP Objects due to a previous cleanup of the ABAP language.

ABAP Objects supports:

-   [Classes](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenclasses.htm)
-   [Interfaces](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abeninterfac.htm)
-   [Objects](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenobject.htm)
-   [Object references](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenreferences.htm)
-   [inheritance](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abeninheritance.htm)

Hint

The package SABAP\_DEMOS\_CAR\_RENTAL contains a complete example application written in ABAP Objects, whose presentation logic is realized by a dynpro or Web Dynpro. The Web Dynpro calls interface methods that are implemented in a class and that access classes that perform database accesses.
