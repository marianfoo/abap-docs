ABAP runtime framework

Also called ABAP runtime environment. Hardware- and operating system-independent platform (virtual machine) of an [ABAP program](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenabap_program_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). Processes of the ABAP runtime framework control the execution of an ABAP program by calling the [processing blocks](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenprocessing_block_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the program. [ABAP statements](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenabap_statement_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") are implemented in the [ABAP kernel](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenkernel_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the ABAP runtime framework. The ABAP runtime framework is provided by the [Application Server ABAP](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenas_abap_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and, therefore, [ABAP programs](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenabap_program_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") can only be executed in AS ABAP.
