Selection Screen Events and List Events

Selection screen events and list events are events of classic [dynpro](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abendynpro_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") processing that are transformed into ABAP events by the ABAP runtime framework and are handled directly in the ABAP program instead of in the [dynpro flow logic](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abendynpro_flow_logic_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
