Hint

The syntax diagrams of the ABAP keyword documentation show the language elements in a syntactically correct order. In many statements, other orders are also possible, but are not mentioned. For the documentation, the order is chosen that best suits the semantics of a statement and which describes the different variants of a statement the most consistently.
