activatable checkpoint

[Checkpoint](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencheckpoint_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that is assigned to a [checkpoint group](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencheckpoint_group_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") using the addition ID of the statements [ASSERT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abapassert.htm), [BREAK-POINT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abapbreak-point.htm), or [LOG-POINT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abaplog-point.htm). The behavior of an activatable checkpoint is controlled by either group-specific or program-specific activation settings, where program-specific settings apply to all activatable checkpoints of a program and overwrite the settings of the relevant checkpoint group.
