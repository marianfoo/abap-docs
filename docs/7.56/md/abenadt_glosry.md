ABAP Development Tools

ADT for short. Eclipse-based tools for editing [repository objects](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenrepository_object_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the [ABAP Repository](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenabap_repository_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and their components. The ADT currently covers a subset of the [ABAP Workbench](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenabap_workbench_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") functions. In the case of newer repository objects, sometimes only ADT can be used.
