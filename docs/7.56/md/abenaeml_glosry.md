ABAP Entity Manipulation Language

ABAP EML or EML for short. Subset of ABAP that allows access to [RAP business objects](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenrap_bo_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in an [ABAP program](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenabap_program_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). When EML statements are executed for a RAP BO, [RAP BO operations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenrap_bo_operation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") are called to access the [transactional buffer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abentransactional_buffer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the BO. The communication between EML and the RAP BO consists of sending and receiving internal tables of special [BDEF derived types](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenrap_derived_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). ABAP EML can be used in any program to access RAP BOs and especially in the [ABAP behavior pool](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenbehavior_pool_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in order to access the transactional buffer of the RAP BO.
