AS instance for short. Component of an [AS ABAP](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenas_abap_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). An AS ABAP can be implemented using one or more AS instances, which are usually instantiated on different [host computers](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenhost_computer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). However, multiple AS instances of one or more AS ABAP can also be instantiated on the same host computer. Each AS instance has [work processes](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenwork_process_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") to execute [ABAP programs](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenabap_program_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The memory areas of an AS instance that can be accessed in the ABAP programs are the [shared memory](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenshared_memory_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), the [user memory](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenuser_memory_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), the [ABAP memory](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenabap_memory_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), and the [session memory](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenroll_area_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in the [internal session](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abeninternal_session_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
