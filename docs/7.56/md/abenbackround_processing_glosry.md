background processing

Execution of [ABAP programs](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenabap_program_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") with defined settings in the background, that is, with no on-screen user dialog. In contrast to [dialog processing](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abendialog_processing_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), the execution process is predefined when the program is started. An [executable program](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenexecutable_program_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is scheduled in [ABAP Editor](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenabap_editor_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or after calling System → Services → Reporting via the menu Program → Execute → Background for automatic execution or is called in the background using [SUBMIT VIA JOB](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abapsubmit_via_job.htm). Background processing takes place in a separate [background session](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenbatch_session_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and at least one background [work process](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenwork_process_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") must be configured.
