CDS BDL - non-standard operations

Non-standard operations are [RAP BO operations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenrap_bo_operation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that provide transactional behavior and that are self-implemented. There are two kinds of non-standard operations available:

-   [Actions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenbdl_action.htm): self-implemented operations that change the data of a BO instance.
-   [Functions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenbdl_function.htm): self-implemented operations that return information without any side effects.
