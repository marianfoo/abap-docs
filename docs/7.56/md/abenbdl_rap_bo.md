RAP business objects of the [implementation types](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_bdef_impl_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") managed and unmanaged are realized through the same set of keywords. These keywords are listed in the following sections, structured by their position within the behavior definition. Some keywords are used differently in managed and unmanaged RAP BOs, or they are handled by the RAP framework in managed scenarios and need to be implemented in unmanaged scenarios. These differences are described in the respective topics.
