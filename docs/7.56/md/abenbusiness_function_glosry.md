Business Function

BF for short. [Repository object](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenrepository_object_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that represents a self-contained (business) function within the scope of the [Switch Framework](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenswitch_framework_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). Multiple business functions are grouped into a [Business Function Set](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenbusiness_function_set_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). Technically, a business function is a grouping of [switches](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenswitch_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that serve the same function. When a business function is activated, the corresponding switches are activated as well. Business functions are created in [transaction](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abentransaction_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") SFW2 and switched in transaction SFW5.
