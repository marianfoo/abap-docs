Call Event Blocks

Event blocks are processing blocks in an ABAP program that are executed when the associated event occurs in the [ABAP runtime framework](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenabap_runtime_frmwk_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). In two cases, such events can be raised programmatically and the event blocks, if implemented, can be called:

-   Using the statement [SET USER-COMMAND](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abapset_user-command.htm) in classic list processing
-   Using the statement [PUT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abapput.htm) in logical databases

Both statements are effectively obsolete. For more information, see the relevant sections.
