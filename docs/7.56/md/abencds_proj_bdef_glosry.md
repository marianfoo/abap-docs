CDS projection behavior definition

CDS projection BDEF or projection BDEF for short. A CDS projection behavior definition is a [CDS behavior definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_behavior_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of [implementation type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_bdef_impl_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") projection. It is based on a [CDS projection view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_projection_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and it represents a projection of a base behavior definition. It exposes a subset of the base BDEF's operations and characteristics. In addition, it can define specific new behavior, such as [augmentation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenrap_bo_augmentation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
