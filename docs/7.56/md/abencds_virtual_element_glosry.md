CDS virtual element

Element in the element list of a [projection view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_projection_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") which is not included in the [projected entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_pv_projected_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). Virtual elements are not persistent on the database, but calculated during runtime, usually in [ABAP classes](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenclass_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). In order to fill and analyze the virtual elements of a projection view, special frameworks like the [RAP query engine](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenrap_query_engine_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") have to be involved.
