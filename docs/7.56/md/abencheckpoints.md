Checkpoints

Checkpoints define points in a program at which the state of the program can be tested during program execution. Checkpoints are either conditional or unconditional. Conditional checkpoints are defined by [assertions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenassertion_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), unconditional checkpoints by [breakpoints](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenbreakpoint_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or [logpoints](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenlogpoint_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). Checkpoints, and breakpoints from outside the program, can be activated and deactivated by assigning them to a [checkpoint group](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencheckpoint_group_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") using the transaction SAAB.
