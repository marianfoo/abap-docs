Assigning Structure Components

The following special language constructs are used to assign components from structures or columns of internal tables:

-   [MOVE-CORRESPONDING](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abapmove-corresponding.htm) for the assignment of identically named components.
-   Component operator [CORRESPONDING](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenconstructor_expr_corresponding.htm) for the assignment of components using identical names or a static mapping rule.
-   System class [CL\_ABAP\_CORRESPONDING](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencl_abap_corresponding.htm) for dynamic mapping rules.
