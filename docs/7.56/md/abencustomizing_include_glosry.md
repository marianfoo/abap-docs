customizing include

[Structure](javascript:call_link\('abenstructure_glosry.htm'\) "Glossary Entry") of the [ABAP Dictionary](javascript:call_link\('abenabap_dictionary_glosry.htm'\) "Glossary Entry"), with a name prefixed by "CI\_" for customers and "SI\_" for partners and that is in the customer namespace. Customizing includes in SAP structures are usually empty. They are not linked with existing structures, they simply reserve their names. In customer or partner systems, these includes can be enhanced in customizing by actually creating the included customizing includes and using customizing transactions to assign them [components](javascript:call_link\('abencomponent_glosry.htm'\) "Glossary Entry").
