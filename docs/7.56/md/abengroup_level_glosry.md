group level

Contiguous quantity of lines in an [internal table](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abeninternal_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or an [extract](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenextract_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that have the same content in an initial part of the lines. Group levels are created by the sequence of the lines in the internal table or the extract . The transition from one group level to the next is called a [group break](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abengroup_break_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). Group levels can be evaluated with [group level processing](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abengroup_level_processing_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
