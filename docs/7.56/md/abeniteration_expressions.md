Iteration Expressions

An iteration expression is a subexpression of specific [constructor expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenconstructor_expression_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") introduced using the iteration operator FOR and executes an iteration in these expressions. In addition to its optional use for creating lines in internal tables with the corresponding variants of the instance operator [NEW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abennew_constructor_params_itab.htm) and the value operator [VALUE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenvalue_constructor_params_itab.htm), there is a special reduction operator REDUCE that is based entirely on iteration expressions.
