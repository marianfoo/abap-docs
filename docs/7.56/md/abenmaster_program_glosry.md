[Compilation unit](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencompilation_unit_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that is modularized into different [processing blocks](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenprocessing_block_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") which are distributed over several [include programs](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abeninclude_program_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). Typical master programs are [class](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenclass_pool_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and [function pools](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenfunction_pool_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), that are created implicitly by the development tools. The [ABAP Unit](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenabap_unit_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") tests for the units in the include programs are usually created in the [test include](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abentest_include_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the master program.
