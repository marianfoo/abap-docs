ABAP Objects - Methods

Methods are declared using the statements

-   [METHODS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abapmethods.htm) for instance methods
-   [CLASS-METHODS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abapclass-methods.htm) for static methods

These are only possible in the declaration part of classes and interfaces.

Methods determine the behavior of a class. [Instance methods](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abeninstance_method_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") are declared by the statement [METHODS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abapmethods.htm), [static methods](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenstatic_method_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") are declared by the statement [CLASS-METHODS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abapclass-methods.htm). The declaration defines the interface of a method. For special tasks there are different types of methods:

-   General [instance methods](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abapmethods_general.htm) and [static methods](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abapclass-methods_general.htm)
-   Functional [instance methods](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abapmethods_functional.htm) and [static methods](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abapclass-methods_functional.htm)
-   [Instance constructors](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abapmethods_constructor.htm) and [static constructors](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abapclass-methods_constructor.htm)
-   [Event handlers](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abapmethods_event_handler.htm) and [static event handlers](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abapclass-methods_event_handler.htm)

The following methods are also available:

-   [Test methods](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abapmethods_testing.htm) of ABAP Unit, which can only be declared as instance methods.
