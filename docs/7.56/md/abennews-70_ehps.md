News for Release 7.0 and its EhPs

From Release 7.0, the further development of ABAP and the ABAP runtime framework took place in Enhancement Packs (EhPs). There were no changes between Release 7.0 and EhP1 (Release 7.01), but in EhP2 (Release 7.02) massive enhancements were made, resulting from a porting of a parallel release track (7.1, 7.2). In EhP3 (Release 7.03) (identical to Release 7.3, EhP1 (7.31) with respect to ABAP and the ABAP runtime framework), hardly any changes were made.
