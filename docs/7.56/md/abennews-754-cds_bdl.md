Modification 1   

Managed RAP BO

The new statement [managed](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenbdl_impl_type.htm) can be used to create [managed RAP BOs](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenmanaged_rap_bo_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") within the framework of the ABAP RESTful Application Programming Model. This scenario is intended for greenfield developments that are developed from scratch. Standard operations and services are provided by the RAP framework.

Modification 2   

Business Object Projection

The new statement [projection](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenbdl_impl_type.htm) can be used to create [projections](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenrap_projection_bo_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of a business object. This allows to project and to alias a subset of a business object for a specific business service within the framework of the ABAP RESTful Application Programming Model.
