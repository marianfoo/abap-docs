Operand Positions

Most ABAP statements have operand positions, where [operands](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenoperands.htm) can be specified as tokens. The following operand positions can be distinguished:

-   [read position](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenread_position_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")
    
    At a read position, the content of an operand is read but not changed when the statement is executed.
    
-   [write position](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenwrite_position_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")
    
    At a write position, the content of an operand is changed when the statement is executed.
