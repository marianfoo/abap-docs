Notations for Single Operands

A single operand, that is, an operand that is not an expression, can either be elementary or be a combination of components. Composite operands are:

-   Structured data types or data objects (structure)
-   Instances of classes (objects)
-   Classes
-   Interfaces

As a consequence, names for operands are either elementary names or names constructed from multiple names separated by component selectors. An elementary name is used for addressing the following:

-   Elementary operands
-   Components that are unique in the current context
-   Superunits made up of components

[Naming conventions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abennaming_conventions.htm) apply to the elementary names. Composite names with component selectors are used for addressing individual components. A component can itself be a superunit of further components. Subcomponents can be addressed by [chaining](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenchaining_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") multiple names.

Hint

In addition to the component selectors listed here, [ABAP SQL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenabap_sql_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") also has a [column selector](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abentable_comp_selector_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") (~).
