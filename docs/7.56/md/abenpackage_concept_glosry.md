package concept

Rule set that is based on [packages](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenpackage_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and specifies the mutual usability of [repository objects](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenrepository_object_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). Currently, only some of the rules are checked and only by the [ABAP Test Cockpit (ATC)](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenabap_test_cockpit_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). There are no checks at runtime.
