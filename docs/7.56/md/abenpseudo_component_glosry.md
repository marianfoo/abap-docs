pseudo component

Expression table\_line that can be specified in accesses to [internal tables](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abeninternal_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") instead of a [component](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencomponent_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The entire line of the internal table is then interpreted as the only component. The name table\_line is a reserved name. In ABAP and in [ABAP Dictionary](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenabap_dictionary.htm), no structure components called table\_line can be defined or created.
