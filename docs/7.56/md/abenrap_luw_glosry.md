RAP LUW

The LUW in RAP is the sum of all operations and workflows that are used to transfer data from one consistent state to another. A RAP LUW begins with creating new data on the [RAP transactional buffer](javascript:call_link\('abentransactional_buffer_glosry.htm'\) "Glossary Entry") or by retrieving data from the database to the transactional buffer. It is terminated with [COMMIT ENTITIES](javascript:call_link\('abapcommit_entities.htm'\)) or [ROLLBACK ENTITIES](javascript:call_link\('abaprollback_entities.htm'\)).
