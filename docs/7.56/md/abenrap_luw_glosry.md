RAP LUW

The LUW in RAP is the sum of all operations and workflows that are used to transfer data from one consistent state to another. A RAP LUW begins with creating new data on the [RAP transactional buffer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abentransactional_buffer_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or by retrieving data from the database to the transactional buffer. It is terminated with [COMMIT ENTITIES](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abapcommit_entities.htm) or [ROLLBACK ENTITIES](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abaprollback_entities.htm).
