regular expression

Regex for short. A pattern of literal and special characters that describes a set of character strings. The use of regular expressions in text searches locates one or more occurrences of the character strings represented by the expression. A search using a regular expression is more powerful than a search for a simple character string because the regular expression represents a greater (potentially infinite) number of character strings and searches for them concurrently. In ABAP, regular expressions can be used in the statements [FIND](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abapfind_pattern.htm) and [REPLACE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abapreplace_in_pattern.htm), as arguments of certain [built-in functions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenbuiltin_function_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), and in the classes CL\_ABAP\_REGEX and CL\_ABAP\_MATCHER.
