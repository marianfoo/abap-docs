REST

Short for Representational State Transfer. An architecture concept for Web services. One of the essential conditions for a [RESTful](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenrestful_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") programming model is a stateless Web server. No client-dependent information can be saved on a Web server between the Web client requests made to the server. The status of a session is managed by the Web client and all necessary information is transferred to the Web server with requests. However, a Web server can also be a client of a persistence layer such as a [database system](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abendatabase_system_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), in which the status of a session is saved persistently for its duration. ABAP supports REST in [ABAP RAP](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenabap_rap_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
