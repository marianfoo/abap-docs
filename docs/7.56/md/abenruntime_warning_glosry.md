runtime warning

A runtime warning indicates critical situations that may cause a [runtime error](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenruntime_error_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") during program execution, such as high memory consumption. A runtime warning creates a [short dump](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenshort_dump_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), but does not terminate the current program.
