stream

Sequential succession of data records, the end of which cannot be predicted. Streams are divided into the [stream kinds](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenstream_kind_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [data stream](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abendata_stream_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and [filter stream](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenfilter_stream_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). A stream is either a [reader stream](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenreader_stream_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or a [writer stream](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenwriter_stream_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and therefore always has exactly one [stream direction](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenstream_direction_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). Furthermore, a distinction is made between the [binary stream](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenbinary_stream_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and [character stream](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencharacter_stream_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). Multiple streams with matching properties can be combined into one stream. In ABAP, streams are implemented using [instances](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abeninstance_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of special [classes](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenclass_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The transfer of streams is called [streaming](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenstreaming_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
