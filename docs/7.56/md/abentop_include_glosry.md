top include

[Include program](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abeninclude_program_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") used for the [global declaration part](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenglobal_declaration_sect_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of an [ABAP program](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenabap_program_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). No [processing blocks](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenprocessing_block_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") should be implemented in top includes. This is checked by the [extended program check](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenextended_program_check_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The corresponding top include is included whenever an individual include program of an ABAP program is compiled.
