Storage where the data that is used during one [RAP LUW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenrap_luw_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is kept. It includes the [RAP BO instance](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenrap_bo_instance_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that are being worked on.
