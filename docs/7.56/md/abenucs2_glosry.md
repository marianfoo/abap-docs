UCS-2

Two byte [Unicode character representation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenunicode_char_represent_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). In this representation, all characters are represented by two bytes (16 bits). In UCS-2, 65536 different characters can be encoded, that correspond to the so called Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP) of the Unicode standard. In contrast to [UTF-16](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenutf16_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), UCS-2 does not support characters from the [surrogate area](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abensurrogate_area_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The ABAP programming language supports UCS-2 in [Unicode systems](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenunicode_system_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and therefore no [surrogates](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abensurrogates_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
