UTF-16

16-bit [Unicode character representation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenunicode_char_represent_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). In this representation, all characters are represented using 2 bytes or 4 bytes. UTF-16 is the [system code page](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abensystem_codepage_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of a [Unicode system](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenunicode_system_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). UTF-16 uses the same 2-byte encoding as [UCS-2](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenucs2_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") for the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP) of the Unicode standard and a 4-byte encoding for the other Unicode planes in the [surrogate area](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abensurrogate_area_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that are addressed by [surrogates](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abensurrogates_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The ABAP programming language supports UCS-2 as a subset of UTF-16 without surrogates.
