ABAP CDS - Amounts and Quantities

In [ABAP CDS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenabap_cds_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), a special handling for amounts and quantities is implemented. [ABAP CDS amount fields](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_amount_field_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and [ABAP CDS quantity fields](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_quantity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") are similar to [DDIC currency fields](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_currency_field_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and [DDIC quantity fields](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_quantity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), but more data types are possible.

ABAP CDS - Amount Fields

An [ABAP CDS amount field](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_amount_field_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is a component of a [CDS entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in [ABAP CDS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenabap_cds_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") used to store an amount in a specific currency. An amount is an integer in the smallest unit of the currency. The integer is constructed from all figures in an amount field while ignoring the position of the decimal separator.

Possible [built-in DDIC data types](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_builtin_types.htm) are CURR, DECFLOAT34, DEC, and FLTP. In case of data type CURR, a field is automatically interpreted as amount field and a reference to a [currency key](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencurrency_key_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") using the annotation [@Semantics.amount.currencyCode](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_element_annotation.htm) is mandatory. In case of the other data types, this reference is not mandatory but if used, it turns the field into an amount field.

A CDS amount field must be linked with a currency key that specifies the currency and the number of decimal places. A currency key is a component of a DDIC structure, DDIC database table, DDIC view, or of a CDS entity which has the type CUKY, and can contain a [currency ID](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencurrency_id_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") from the DDIC database table TCURC.

By default, the number of decimal places for an amount is always two. Currencies with a different number of decimal places must also be entered in the table TCURX, where the number of decimal places can be defined explicitly.

For handling of CDS amount fields in ABAP Dictionary, handling in dynpros, and handling in ABAP programs, the same rules apply as for currency fields in DDIC, see topic [ABAP DDIC - Currency Fields](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_currency_field.htm).

Handling of CDS amount fields in expressions in CDS view entities

In [CDS view entities](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_v2_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), special handling for CDS amount fields is implemented:

When used in [expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_expressions_v2.htm), [UNION views](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v2.htm), or [INTERSECT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_intersect_v2.htm) views, the reference annotation of a CDS amount field to a currency key is considered. Special rules apply concerning how amounts and quantities can be combined in calculations, compatibility of data types, and result types. A new result type is available: the [CDS calculated quantity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_calculated_quantity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The rules are documented in the respective sections:

-   [Amounts and quantities in arithmetic expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_arit_exp_calc_v2.htm)
-   [Amounts and quantities in aggregate functions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v2.htm)
-   Amounts and quantities in [simple](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_simple_case_expression_v2.htm) and [complex case expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_searched_case_expr_v2.htm)
-   [Amounts and quantities in UNION views](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v2.htm)
-   [Amounts and quantities in INTERSECT views](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_intersect_v2.htm)

Note: [Cast expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_cast_expression_v2.htm) do not handle amounts. Only the target type CURR requires a reference to a currency key.

The following two conversion functions are available for amounts in CDS view entities:

-   [GET\_NUMERIC\_VALUE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_conv_func_unit_curr_v2.htm): removes the reference to a currency key and returns the numeric value of a field.
-   [CURR\_TO\_DECFLOAT\_AMOUNT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_conv_func_unit_curr_v2.htm): converts an amount field of data type CURR into an amount field of data type DECFLOAT34.
-   Note: The function [DECIMAL\_SHIFT](abencds_conv_func_unit_curr_v1.htm#!ABAP_VARIANT_3@3@) is not available in CDS view entities.

Hints

-   Reference annotations that assign a currency key to a field are propagated in CDS entities selecting from DDIC database tables or other CDS entities. It is possible, but not mandatory, to redefine them. This is true for all CDS entities except of CDS DDIC-based views.
-   Currently, the handling of CDS amount fields in expressions is only available in CDS view entities and not in any other [CDS entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
-   Currencies are handled as specified by the data saved in the database tables TCUR... of the package SFIB. The exchange rates and other settings can be maintained in transaction OB08.

ABAP CDS - Quantity Fields

An [ABAP CDS quantity field](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_quantity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is a component of a [CDS entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in [ABAP CDS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenabap_cds_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") used to store a quantity in a specific unit.

Possible [built-in ABAP Dictionary data types](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_builtin_types.htm) are QUAN, DECFLOAT16, DECFLOAT34, DEC, FLTP, INT1, INT2, or INT4. In case of data type QUAN, the field is automatically interpreted as quantity field and a reference to a [unit of measurement key](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenunit_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") using the annotation [@Semantics.quantity.unitOfMeasure](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_element_annotation.htm) is mandatory. In case of the other data types, this reference is not mandatory but if used, it turns the field into a quantity field.

A quantity field must be linked with a unit key that defines the unit and the number of decimal places. A unit key is a component of a structure, DDIC database table, DDIC view or of another CDS entity of type UNIT and it can contain a [unit ID](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenunit_id_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") from the DDIC database table T006.

For handling of CDS quantity fields in ABAP Dictionary, handling in dynpros, and handling in ABAP programs, the same rules apply as for currency fields in DDIC, see topic [ABAP DDIC - Quantity Fields](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_quantity_field.htm).

Handling of CDS quantity fields in expressions in CDS view entities

In CDS view entities, special handling for CDS quantity fields is implemented:

When used in [expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_expressions_v2.htm), [UNION views](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v2.htm), or [INTERSECT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_intersect_v2.htm) views, the reference annotation of a CDS quantity field to a unit key is considered. Special rules apply concerning how amounts and quantities can be combined in calculations, compatibility of data types, and result types. A new result type is available: the [CDS calculated quantity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_calculated_quantity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

-   [Amounts and quantities in UNION views](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v2.htm)
-   [Amounts and quantities in INTERSECT views](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_intersect_v2.htm)

Note: [Cast expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_cast_expression_v2.htm) do not handle quantities. Only the target type QUAN requires a reference to a unit key.

The following conversion function is available for quantities in CDS view entities:

-   [GET\_NUMERIC\_VALUE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_conv_func_unit_curr_v2.htm): removes the reference to a unit key and returns the numeric value of a field.

Hints

-   Reference annotations that assign a unit key to a field are propagated in CDS entities selecting from DDIC database tables or other CDS entities. It is possible, but not mandatory, to redefine them. This is true for all CDS entities except of CDS DDIC-based views.
-   Currently, the handling of CDS quantity fields in expressions is only available in CDS view entities and not in any other [CDS entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
-   Quantities and units are handled as specified by the data saved in the DDIC database tables T006... in the package SZME. This data can be maintained using the transaction CUNI.

ABAP CDS - Calculated Quantity with Calculated Unit

A [CDS calculated quantity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_calculated_quantity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is a component of a [CDS view entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_v2_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or of a [CDS projection view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_projection_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in [ABAP CDS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenabap_cds_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") used to store a quantity in a specific unit. A calculated quantity is always the result type of a calculation using [ABAP CDS amount fields](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_amount_field_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and/or [ABAP CDS quantity fields](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_quantity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The DDIC data type of a calculated quantity is [DECFLOAT34](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_builtin_types.htm). A calculated quantity must be linked with a [ABAP CDS calculated unit](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_calculated_unit_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") using the annotation [@Semantics.quantity.unitOfMeasure: 'calculatedUnit'](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_element_annotation.htm). A calculated unit is a component of the same CDS view entity of data type CHAR that specifies a self-defined unit which is not contained in any list of pre-defined values. The DDIC data element DD\_CDS\_CALCULATED\_UNIT and DDIC domain DD\_CDS\_CALCULATED\_UNIT can be used to type a calculated unit, but this is not mandatory.

In CDS view entities, the following functions are available for amount and quantity fields:

-   [GET\_NUMERIC\_VALUE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_conv_func_unit_curr_v2.htm) removes reference information from an amount or quantity field.
-   [CURR\_TO\_DECFLOAT\_AMOUNT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_conv_func_unit_curr_v2.htm) converts an amount field of data type CURR to data type DECFLOAT34, including shifting. The result remains an amount.

Calculated quantities can be the result type of the following expressions in CDS view entities:

-   [Arithmetic expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_arit_exp_calc_v2.htm)
-   [Aggregate functions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v2.htm)
-   [Simple](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_simple_case_expression_v2.htm) and [complex case expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_searched_case_expr_v2.htm)
-   Note: [Cast expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_cast_expression_v2.htm) do not handle calculated quantities.

Moreover, special rules apply in the following operand positions in CDS view entities:

-   [UNION views](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v2.htm)
-   [INTERSECT views](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_intersect_v2.htm)

Hints

-   Reference annotations to currency or unit of measurement keys are propagated in CDS entities selecting from DDIC database tables or other CDS entities. It is possible, but not mandatory, to redefine them.
-   Currently, CDS calculated quantities are only available in CDS view entities and in CDS projection views. They are not supported in any other [CDS entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
-   If a field is a calculated quantity, this characteristic is inherited when a view entity selects from another view entity.
-   A calculated unit can be used as reference only once in a view. If a view contains several calculated quantity fields, each field needs a different calculated unit.

Example

In the following CDS view entity, the field rent\_per\_size divides the amount of the rent for an apartment by the apartment size. The result is the cost per square meter. The calculated unit is EUR/MTK, MTK being the unit ID for square meter.

@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_ALLOWED
@EndUserText.label: 'CDS view entity, calculated quantity'
define view entity DEMO\_CDS\_CALCULATED\_QUANTITY
  as select from demo\_rent
{
  key apartment\_id                     as ApartmentId,
      apartment\_size                   as ApartmentSize,
      apartment\_unit                   as ApartmentUnit,
      currency                         as Currency,
      
      // currency field and unit field in arith expression
      @Semantics.quantity.unitOfMeasure: 'calculatedUnit'
      rent\_decfloat34 / apartment\_size as rent\_per\_size,
      concat( concat(currency, '/' ), apartment\_unit )  
                                       as calculatedUnit
}

The program DEMO\_CDS\_CALCULATED\_QUANTITY accesses the view, inserts values into the underlying database table, and displays the result.

Effect

The statement define annotation defines a [CDS annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") with the name Anno in the [CDS DDL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_ddl_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in the [DDLA source code](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddla_source_code_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The annotation Anno is the [main annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenmain_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the current [annotation definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_anno_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), which can be structured with optional [subannotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abensub_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The DDLA source code of an annotation definition can contain the definition of exactly one main annotation, whose name must match the name of the DDLA source code. The names are case-sensitive. Annotations of the definition annotation, [@annotation\_annot1](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_anno_annos.htm), [@annotation\_annot2](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_anno_annos.htm), ..., can be specified before the statement define annotation. These are inherited by subannotations or overwritten there.

The statement define annotation creates the annotation Anno as a [CDS object](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_object_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), which is transported using the DDLA source code. The definition of the annotation Anno describes how it is to be used in other CDS source code in [annotation syntax](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotation_syntax_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"):

-   Anno is the name of the annotation. It can contain letters, numbers, and underscores, and must start with a letter. Only annotations with names defined in this way should be [used](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_syntax.htm).
-   One of the following must be specified after the name:
    -   A colon (:) followed by the definition of the type [type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_annotation_type.htm) of the annotation. Enumerations and a default value can be defined when the type is specified. The type specification must be closed using a (;).
    -   An optional colon (:) followed by the structuring of the annotation using [subannotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abensub_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [subannos](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_annotation_sub.htm) in curly brackets {...}. This can be closed using an optional semicolon (;).
    -   A colon (:) followed by the definition of the elements of an array using array of. This makes the annotation Anno into an [annotation array](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenannotation_array_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the elements defined using [arrelem](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_annotation_arr.htm). These elements can be a type specification or subannotations.

Hints

-   Put simply, an annotation definition specifies how the annotation needs to be specified in CDS source code in [annotation syntax](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotation_syntax_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). When annotations are specified, the annotation definitions are used for the color of the source code and for code completion.
    -   The type specification determines which [annotation values](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenannotation_value_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") can be specified in the annotation syntax when the annotation is used.
    -   In the annotation syntax, subannotations are specified either as [comma-separated lists in curly brackets](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_syntax_subanno.htm) or as [structured names](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_syntax_name.htm).
    -   The elements of an array are specified in annotation syntax as [comma-separated lists in square brackets](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_syntax_array.htm).
-   The syntax check in [CDS DDL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_ddl_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") for data definitions currently ignores annotation definitions. It checks only the formal correctness of any names, [annotation values](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenannotation_value_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), [subannotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abensub_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), and [annotation arrays](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenannotation_array_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") specified.
-   When [annotations are evaluated](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_semantics_annotation_abexa.htm) in a [CDS entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") using the class CL\_DD\_DDL\_ANNOTATION\_SERVICE, the annotations are respected as specified in the [DDL source code](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddl_source_code_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the entity. The associated annotation definitions are ignored.
-   Alongside the rules defined by the statement define annotation, an annotation definition also has annotation documentation that describes its meaning and how it is used by the framework in question.

Example

Defines a structured annotation. The [main annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenmain_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") DEMOANNOSTRUCT has [subannotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abensub_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") subAnno1 to subAnno4. The subannotations subAnno3 and subAnno4 are [annotation arrays](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenannotation_array_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). (Here, subAnno4 is structured.)

@Scope:\[#VIEW, #EXTEND\_VIEW\]  
define annotation DemoAnnoStruct  
  { subAnno1 : Boolean default true;  
    subAnno2 : Integer enum { I1; I2; I3; } default #I1;  
    subAnno3 : array of String(10);  
    subAnno4 : array of { comp1 : String(1);  
                          comp2 : String(2);  
                        };  
  };

The annotation defined in this way allows the following to be specified in [annotation syntax](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotation_syntax_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in a piece of [DDL source code](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddl_source_code_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that defines a [CDS view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or a [CDS table function](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_table_function_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") as a view annotation ([CDS view entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_entity_anno.htm), [CDS projection view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_proj_view_annotations.htm), [CDS DDIC-based views](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_anno_v1.htm)) or as a [function annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_function_annotations.htm):

-   Specifies the subannotation subAnno1 once (the default value true is used here implicitly):
    
    @DemoAnnoStruct.subAnno1
    
-   Specifies the subannotations subAnno1 and subAnno2 together in curly brackets (the default values are overwritten by explicit [annotation values](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenannotation_value_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") here. In subAnno2, one of the fixed enumerated values is used:
    
    @DemoAnnoStruct:{subAnno1:false, subAnno2:#I2}
    
-   Specifies annotation values for the annotation array subAnno3. The values within the quotation marks can have a maximum of ten characters:
    
    @DemoAnnoStruct.subAnno3:\['a','abc','abcdefghij'\]
    
-   Specifies annotation values for the structured annotation array subAnno4.
    
    @DemoAnnoStruct.subAnno4:\[ {comp1: 'a', comp2: 'b' },
                               {comp1: 'c', comp2: 'd' },
                               {comp1: 'e', comp2: 'f' } \]

Syntax

... @[annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_syntax.htm) ...

Effect

Specifies an [annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_syntax.htm) as an annotation definition annotation in front of the statement [DEFINE ANNOTATION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_annotation.htm) or in front of a [subannotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abensub_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in an [annotation definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_anno_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in [ABAP CDS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenabap_cds_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The character @ must be placed in front of the name annotation of the annotation. The annotation must be defined as a CDS object in a [CDS annotation definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_anno_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and the annotation definition annotation @Scope must be specified here using the value #ANNOTATION.

The annotations of an annotation definition can be specified in front of the name of the [main annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenmain_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and in front of the names of [subannotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abensub_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). If an annotation is not specified directly in front of a subannotation, it is inherited by the next higher annotation in the hierarchy.

The following tables show the possible [ABAP annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenabap_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that can be specified and their meanings. Annotations with other identifiers are usually [framework-specific annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_frmwrk.htm). These are not evaluated by the ABAP runtime framework but by other SAP frameworks instead.

-   [AbapAnnotation Annotations](#abencds-f1-define-anno-annos-1-------api-annotations---@ITOC@@ABENCDS_F1_DEFINE_ANNO_ANNOS_2)

-   [MetadataExtension Annotations](#abencds-f1-define-anno-annos-5-------scope-annotations---@ITOC@@ABENCDS_F1_DEFINE_ANNO_ANNOS_6)

The first column of the table shows the (possibly structured) name annotation of an ABAP annotation and the second column shows its meaning. The third column shows the possible [annotation values](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenannotation_value_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The fourth column shows the default value which is used if the annotation is not used at all.

Here, the subannotation rc specifies a [release contract](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenrelease_contract_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in the annotation syntax. The following can be specified:

-   c0
    
    The [C0 contract](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenc0_contract_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") allows extension fields to be added at specific extension points.
    
-   c1
    
    The [C1 contract](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenc1_contract_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") guarantees a stable interface for use within AS ABAP.
    
-   c2
    
    The [C2 contract](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenc2_contract_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") guarantees a stable interface for uses outside AS ABAP too.
    

In annotation definitions delivered by SAP, the annotations @CompatibilityContract must be specified for the release contract C1 and C2, both for the main annotation and for every subannotation. They define the usability of the main annotations and subannotations in the [CDS source code](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_source_code_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of a CDS entity with respect to their release contract. A CDS entity is mapped to a release contract using tools such as [ADT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenadt_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or in special transactions, and not in its CDS source code.

Hint

When specified, the annotation @CompatibilityContract can be governed by framework-specific conditions, such as the features of analytic frameworks that consume CDS views. SAP reserves the right to modify @CompatibilityContract if these framework-specific conditions change.

Example

Example of the use of the annotation @CompatibilityContract in an [annotation definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_anno_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The annotation that follows can be used in CDS entities with the release contract c1. Here, it can added and removed even after the release of a CDS entity and the annotation values can be modified. It cannot be used in CDS entities with the release contract c0 and c2.

@CompatibilityContract: {
   c0: { usageAllowed: false },
   c1: { usageAllowed: true,
         allowedChanges.annotation: \[ #ANY \],
         allowedChanges.value: \[ #ANY \] },
   c2: { usageAllowed: false } }

LanguageDependency Annotations

Specifies that the [annotation value](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenannotation_value_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is a translatable text.

The maximum usable length of the text. The recommended length is determined by the length determined in the [type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_annotation_type.htm). No values greater than the recommended value can be specified.

\-

\-

Hints

-   The annotation LanguageDependency.maxLength can only be specified for annotations of [String](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_annotation_type.htm) with lengths between 10 and 255. This means that it can usually only be used directly in front of subannotations of this type.
-   The value of such an annotation is saved in special tables that have a language key and that are translatable. The value specified in the source code should consist of text in the original language of the CDS source code and it is translated into the required languages. The methods of the class CL\_DD\_DDL\_ANNOTATION\_SERVICE read these texts as specified by an input parameter for the language. If no language is passed to the input parameter, the [text environment language](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abentext_env_langu_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is used as the default. If no text is found for the language, the [secondary language](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abensecondary_language_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in AS ABAP is used.

MetadataExtension Annotations

Specify how annotations are moved to [CDS metadata extensions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_metadata_extension_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

MetadataExtension.usageAllowed

Specifies whether the annotation can be specified in a metadata extension when the statement [ANNOTATE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_annotate_view.htm) is used.

true:
The annotation can be specified in a metadata extension
false:
The annotation cannot be specified in a metadata extension

false

true

Hint

Alongside @MetadataExtension.usageAllowed:true, the scope specified using the annotation @Scope determines where the annotation can be specified in a metadata extension. The scope must match the annotation and metadata extensions must be allowed for this scope.

Scope Annotations

Define the [scope of the annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_scopes.htm).

\-

The [scope](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_scopes.htm) of each annotation must be defined using @Scope. It determines the places in CDS source code where the annotation can be [specified](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_anno_usage.htm). @Scope is an [annotation array](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenannotation_array_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), which means that multiple [annotation values](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenannotation_value_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") can be specified in square brackets. If no scope can be determined for an annotation or subannotation, a syntax error occurs.

Hint

While the annotation value #ENTITY defines that an annotation can be specified in the definition of any CDS entity, this is not the case for the annotation value #VIEW. The annotation value #VIEW defines that an annotation can be specified in the definition of one of the possible kinds of CDS views (view entity, projection view, DDIC-based view) but it does not define exactly where. There is a special a set of [ABAP annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenabap_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that can be used in [DDIC-based views](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_v1_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") only. The ABAP annotations that can be specified for a kind of view are documented for the respective DEFINE statement. For an overview see [ABAP Annotation Syntax](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_abap_tables.htm).

CDS DDL - DEFINE ANNOTATION, type

Syntax

... dtype *\[*enum { SYMBOL1; SYMBOL2; ... }*\]* *\[*default val*|*#SYMBOL*\]*

Effect

Defines the [annotation values](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenannotation_value_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") to be specified when a [CDS annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") defined using [define annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_annotation.htm) is [used](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_syntax.htm) in a CDS entity.

dtype is used to define the type. The following tables show the possible options for dtype and their meaning for the annotation values. dtype and any predefined values are case-sensitive.

Value Types

dtype

Annotation Value

Boolean

Truth values true and false.

Decimal(len,dec)

Numeric literal without quotation marks and with an optional decimal point and a maximum of len minus dec integer digits and a maximum of dec decimal places. A number between 1 and 31 can be specified for len and a number between 0 and 14 can be specified for dec, but dec cannot be greater than len.

DecimalFloat

Numeric literal without quotation marks. The same values can be specified as in the source field of an ABAP conversion from [c to decfloat34](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenconversion_type_c.htm)

Integer

Numeric literal without quotation marks and decimal separator in the value range of the ABAP type [i](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenbuiltin_types_numeric.htm).

String(len)

Character literal in quotation marks with a maximum length len. A number between 0 and 1298 can be specified for len.

Reference Types

dtype

Annotation Value

AssociationRef

Name of a CDS association that is exposed in the SELECT list where the annotation is used. If the association is defined in the same CDS entity, the annotation value must be the association's name. If the association is defined in another entity, the annotation value must be a [path expression](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_path_expression_v2.htm).

ElementRef

Name of an element of the CDS entity where the annotation is used. For elements of association targets, the annotation value is a [path expression](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_path_expression_v2.htm).

EntityRef

Name of any CDS entity.

KeyElement

Name of a key field of the CDS entity where the annotation is used.

LocalDefinitionRef

Name of a [data source](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_data_source_v2.htm) of the current CDS entity. The data source can either be defined after FROM or as an [association](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_simple_association_v2.htm). If an alias name is specified for the data source, this alias name must be specified as annotation value.

ParameterRef

Name of a parameter of the CDS entity where the annotation is used.

When [used](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_syntax_value.htm), the annotation value of a reference type must be specified as a character literal in quotation marks and without blanks. The object specified must exist.

enum { SYMBOL1; SYMBOL; ... } can be used to specify a semicolon-separated (;) list of enumeration symbols SYMBOL1, SYMBOL2, ... in uppercase letters and in curly brackets. A semicolon must also be placed after the final entry in the list here. When an annotation is used, only one of the enumeration symbols prefixed with the # character can be used as an [annotation value](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenannotation_value_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). If enumeration symbols are specified for the type String, the symbols become the enumerated values explicitly. In this case, the length specified for String must be at least as long as the longest enumeration symbol.

default can be used to specify a type-compliant default value applied when an annotation is used and no explicit [annotation value](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenannotation_value_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is specified. The following applies here:

-   Only true can be specified as a default value for the type Boolean.
-   If enumeration symbols are defined, the default value of one of these symbols must be prefixed with the # character.
-   No default value can be specified for reference types.
-   No default values can be specified for the elements of an [annotation array](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenannotation_array_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

Hints

-   The truth values for the type boolean can also be specified as 'true' and 'false' in quotation marks.
-   The smallest feasible size is 1 for one character.
-   The default value defined using default describes the default value applied when the annotation is used in its framework. If an annotation is not used, there can be another default value (described in the documentation of the annotation). The default value of the annotation definition is ignored when the annotation is saved and [evaluated](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_analysis.htm) internally.

Example

The following annotation definition specifies truth values as possible annotation values of the annotation:

@Scope:\[#VIEW, #EXTEND\_VIEW\]
define annotation DemoAnnoBoolean : Boolean;

The annotation can be used as followed in CDS source code:

-   @DemoAnnoBoolean: true
-   @DemoAnnoBoolean: false
-   @DemoAnnoBoolean: 'true'
-   @DemoAnnoBoolean: 'false'

Example

The following annotation definition specifies enumerated values as possible annotation values of the annotation. In the case of the type String, the enumeration symbols are also the enumerated values and a length of at least 10 must be specified for the type, since the longest enumeration symbol as 10 characters.

@Scope:\[#VIEW, #EXTEND\_VIEW\]
define annotation DemoAnnoEnum : String(10)  
                                 enum{SHORT\_TEXT;TEXT;LONG\_TEXT;};

The annotation can be used as followed in CDS source code:

-   @DemoAnnoEnum: #SHORT\_TEXT
-   @DemoAnnoEnum: #TEXT
-   @DemoAnnoEnum: #LONG\_TEXT

Example

The following annotation definition specifies numeric literals as possible annotation values of the annotation (a default value is defined here).

@Scope:\[#VIEW, #EXTEND\_VIEW\]  
define annotation DemoAnnoDefault : Integer default 0;

The annotation can be used as follows in CDS source code, with and without a value being specified:

-   @DemoAnnoDefault
-   @DemoAnnoDefault: 100

Example

The following annotation definition has incorrect syntax. The specified length 1 is not sufficient for the specified default value of length 3.

annotation DemoAnno : String(1) default 'XXX';

    ...

Effect

Structures a [CDS annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") using [subannotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abensub_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") subAnno1, subAnno2, ... . The subannotations are defined in a semicolon-separated list in curly brackets { ... } in the statement [define annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_annotation.htm) (a semicolon must be placed after the final entry in the list too). The names of the subannotations of an annotation must be unique.

Each subannotation is specified using the same syntax as when the [main annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenmain_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is specified after [define annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_annotation.htm). This means the following:

-   The name of the subannotation can contain letters, numbers, and underscores only and must start with a letter.
-   [type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_annotation_type.htm) can be used to define the possible [annotation value](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenannotation_value_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") for a subannotation
-   A subannotation can itself be structured using further subannotations subannos
-   A subannotation can be defined as an [annotation array](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenannotation_array_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of array elements [arrelem](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_annotation_arr.htm) using array of

Annotation definition annotations [@annotation\_annot1](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_anno_annos.htm), [@annotation\_annot2](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_anno_annos.htm), ... can be specified in front of each subannotation. These annotations override any identically named annotation definition annotations specified for the structured annotation itself. Any annotations not specified directly in front of a subannotation are inherited by the next higher annotation in the hierarchy.

Hints

-   Colons (:) in front of the opening curly bracket and semicolons (;) after the closing curly structuring bracket { ... } are optional.
-   In the [annotation syntax](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_syntax.htm), structured annotations are specified either using [comma-separated lists in curly brackets](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_syntax_subanno.htm) or using [structured names](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_syntax_name.htm).

Example

Defines a structured [main annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenmain_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") DemoAnnoMain with three [subannotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abensub_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), two of which are themselves structured. The semicolons after the closing curly structuring brackets are omitted here.

@Scope:\[#VIEW, #EXTEND\_VIEW\]  
define annotation DemoAnnoMain{ subAnno1: Boolean;  
                                subAnno2{ subsubAnno1:String(3);  
                                          subsubAnno2:Integer;}  
                                subAnno3{ subsubAnno1:String(3);  
                                          subsubAnno2:Integer;} }

The annotation can be used, for example, as followed in CDS source code:

@DemoAnnoMain: {subAnno1:true,
                subAnno2:{subsubAnno1:'X',
                          subsubAnno2:100},
                subAnno3:{subsubAnno1:'Y',
                          subsubAnno2:200} }

The exact same result can be achieved as follows:

@DemoAnnoMain.subAnno1:true
@DemoAnnoMain.subAnno2.subsubAnno1:'X'
@DemoAnnoMain.subAnno2.subsubAnno2:100
@DemoAnnoMain.subAnno3.subsubAnno1:'Y'
@DemoAnnoMain.subAnno3.subsubAnno2:200

    -   The type specification must be closed using a semicolon (;).
-   {[subannos](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_annotation_sub.htm)} defines an annotation array for [subannotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abensub_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in curly brackets. If specified, subannotations can be closed using an optional semicolon (;).

The same information can be specified for [type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_annotation_type.htm) and [subannos](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_annotation_sub.htm) as for elementary annotations. It is not possible to define a further annotation array directly. Subannotations can, however, be arrays themselves.

Hint

When an annotation array is used in [annotation syntax](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_syntax.htm) in CDS source code, a [comma-separated list](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_syntax_array.htm) is specified in square brackets. This list contains the information defined by [type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_annotation_type.htm) or [structure](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_annotation_sub.htm) as often as necessary.

Example

Defines an annotation array DemoAnnoIntegerArray for number values.

@Scope:\[#VIEW, #EXTEND\_VIEW\]  
annotation DemoAnnoIntegerArray : array of Integer;

The annotation can be used as follows in CDS source code, for example, to specify as many numbers as necessary:

@DemoAnnoIntegerArray:\[123,456,789\]

Example

Defines a structured annotation array DemoAnnoStructArray.

@Scope:\[#VIEW, #EXTEND\_VIEW\]  
annotation DemoAnnoStructArray : array of  
             { subAnno1: Boolean default true;  
               subAnno2: String(100) default 'whatsoever'; };

The annotation can be used as follows in CDS source code, for example, to specify as many subannotations as necessary:

@DemoAnnoStructArray:\[{subAnno1,      subAnno2},
                      {subAnno1:true, subAnno2:'Some Text'},
                      {subAnno1:true, subAnno2:'Other Text'} \]

ABAP CDS - DDL for Metadata Extensions

Alongside the [DDL statements for data definitions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_ddl_syntax.htm), the [CDS DDL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_ddl_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in ABAP CDS makes it possible to define [metadata extensions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_meta_data_extensions.htm) for CDS entities in [DDLX source code](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddlx_source_code_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The following statement is used here:

-   [ANNOTATE ENTITY, VIEW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_annotate_view.htm)

Hints

-   The [DDLX source code](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddlx_source_code_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of metadata extensions has its own editor in [ADT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenadt_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), which is documented there. DDLX source code can also be displayed in [Repository Browser](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenrepository_browser_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in [ABAP Workbench](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenabap_workbench_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

[... VARIANT variant](#!ABAP_ONE_ADD@1@)

Effect

Defines a [CDS metadata extension](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_metadata_extension_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") (MDE for short) in dedicated [DDLX source code](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddlx_source_code_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

-   ANNOTATE ENTITY
    
    Defines an MDE for any [CDS entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") except [CDS table functions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_table_function_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
    
-   ANNOTATE VIEW
    
    Defines an MDE specifically for a [CDS view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
    

The CDS metadata extension adds metadata to a CDS entity as [CDS annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The entity in question must exist, be specified using the name of its [CDS entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") cds\_entity or cds\_view, and contain the annotationMetadata.allowExtensions with the default value true in its source code. A CDS entity can have more than one CDS metadata extension.

The annotation [@Metadata.layer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_metadata_ext_annos.htm) must be specified with one of the enumeration symbols shown in the example in front of the statement ANNOTATE to define the layer of the metadata extension. In the [analysis of metadata extensions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_meta_data_extension_eval.htm), the layer determines the priority of the metadata if there are multiple metadata extensions for the same CDS entity that is linked with the same [CDS variant](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_variant_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or not linked with any variants. The enumeration symbols are listed with the lowest priority ones on the left and the highest priority on the right. #CORE therefore has the lowest, and #CUSTOMER the highest priority. If multiple CDS metadata extensions with none or the same CDS variant are assigned to the same layer, a syntax check warning is issued for annotations specified more than one, and the system uses the annotation of the first metadata extension found.

The annotations added to the extended entity are defined as follows. A metadata extension must contain at least one of these.

-   Annotations in front of the statement ANNOTATE
    -   Only entity annotations @entity\_annot can be specified in front of the statement ANNOTATE ENTITY. Valid [SAP annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_sap.htm) must be in the [scope](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_scopes.htm) of the [entity annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_entity_annotations.htm). They are added to the entity annotations of the extended entity.
    -   Entity annotations and view annotations @view\_annot can be specified in front of the statement ANNOTATE VIEW. Valid [SAP annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_sap.htm) must be in the [scope](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_scopes.htm) of the [view annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_entity_anno.htm). They are added to the view annotations of the extended view.
-   [parameter\_list](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_annotate_view_para_list.htm) is used to specify annotations for the parameters of the extended entity.
-   [element\_list](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_annotate_view_sele_list.htm) is used specify annotations for the elements of SELECT list of the extended entity.

In metadata extensions, only those annotations can be specified for which this is allowed in their [annotation definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_anno_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") using the annotation [@MetadataExtension.usageAllowed:true](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_anno_annos.htm). In the CDS metadata extension, an annotation can be used in the same scope defined using [@Scope](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_anno_annos.htm) as in a data definition. All other annotations produce syntax errors.

These annotations of a metadata extension are respected in the [evaluation of annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_analysis.htm) with the methods of the class CL\_DD\_DDL\_ANNOTATION\_SERVICE except for GET\_DIRECT\_ANNOS\_, in accordance with the layers defined by the annotation @Metadata.layer and in accordance with the used [CDS variants](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_variant_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). Here the annotations of a metadata extension always have a higher priority than the annotations specified in the source code of the CDS entity. These are only respected if they are not overridden by a corresponding annotation of a metadata extension. For the exact description of the evaluation, see section [evaluation of metadata extensions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_meta_data_extension_eval.htm).

Hints

-   Unlike the specification of annotations in the source code of the extended CDS entity, it is not possible to have any arbitrary annotations in metadata extensions; it is only possible to have [SAP annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_sap.htm). The syntax check for a metadata extension checks the validity of its specification with respect to the [annotation definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_anno_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"):
    -   the name of an annotation
    -   the validity of the [annotation values](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenannotation_value_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), the type, and (for enumerations) the enumeration symbol
    -   the [scope](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_scopes.htm)
    -   whether any [annotation arrays](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenannotation_array_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") are specified correctly (they must only be specified using square brackets). The format @annot: value is not possible. @annot: \[value\] must be used instead. The array can contain only similar elements (in accordance with its definition).
-   The annotations (of a CDS entity) specified in metadata extensions does not have any effect on the activation or the behavior at runtime. They are only respected by the class CL\_DD\_DDL\_ANNOTATION\_SERVICE.
-   The program ABAP\_DOCU\_MDE\_ANNOS shows all annotations that can be specified in metadata extensions.

Example

The following metadata extension named DEMO\_CDS\_METADATA\_EXTENSION adds annotations with original language "German" to the CDS view DEMO\_CDS\_PARAMETERS from the executable example for [CDS views with parameters](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenselect_cds_para_abexa.htm). The program DEMO\_CDS\_META\_DATA\_EXTENSIONS reads the annotations of the view with the methods of the classes CL\_DD\_DDL\_ANNOTATION\_SERVICE and CL\_DD\_DDL\_ANALYZE. The method GET\_ANNOS of the class CL\_DD\_DDL\_ANNOTATION\_SERVICE covers both the annotations specified in the metadata extension and the translations into the current text environment language. The method GET\_ANNOTATIONS of the class CL\_DD\_DDL\_ANALYZE only evaluates the specifications in the view DEMO\_CDS\_PARAMETERS.

};

Example

The following metadata extension DEMO\_CDS\_MDE\_FOR\_ABSTR\_ENT adds entity annotations and element annotations to the [CDS abstract entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_abstract_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") DEMO\_CDS\_ABSTRACT\_ENTITY\_ELEM from the example for its [element annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_absent_list_annotation.htm).

Addition   

... VARIANT variant

Effect

Links the metadata extension with a [CDS variant](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_variant_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). An existing CDS variant must be specified for variant. This entry is not case sensitive. If there are multiple metadata extensions for the same CDS entity contained in the layer defined with annotation @Metadata.layer, these extensions should be assigned to CDS variants, because otherwise a warning is raised by the syntax check for duplicate annotations.

In [evaluations of annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_analysis.htm) using the class CL\_DD\_DDL\_ANNOTATION\_SERVICE, the CDS variant can be specified to select the metadata extension. The class collects the annotations that it returned, in accordance with the layers and variants in line with the hierarchy described under the [evaluation of metadata extensions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_meta_data_extension_eval.htm).

Hints

-   [CDS variants](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_variant_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") are created in the [ADT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_variant_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and this creation process is documented there too.
-   From a technical perspective, the annotations specified in metadata extensions for a CDS entity are similar to the annotations specified in the [DDL source code](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddl_source_code_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), separated by layers and variants in separate system tables and made accessible using an API. Annotations with [translatable texts](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_analysis.htm) are also stored here in tables, which are connected to translation. The class CL\_DD\_DDL\_ANNOTATION\_SERVICE evaluates the system tables.

Caution

CDS variants are not currently released for general use. It is not possible to define standalone CDS variants and the use of CDS variants in metadata extensions produces a syntax check warning.

Effect

Specifies annotations for the following parameters:

-   [Parameter list](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_entity_parameter_list.htm) of an [CDS abstract entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_abstract_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")
-   [Parameter list](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_parameter_list_v2.htm) of a [CDS view entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_v2_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")
-   [Parameter list](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_parameter_list_v1.htm) of a [CDS DDIC-based view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_v1_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")

The parameters in a [CDS metadata extension](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_metadata_extension_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") introduced using [ANNOTATE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_annotate_view.htm). A comma-separated list pname1, pname2, ... prefixed with annotations @parameter\_annot can be specified after PARAMETERS. There must not be comma after the last element of the list.

Each parameter pname specified after PARAMETERS should appear in the parameter list of the entity extended using ANNOTATE. If not, the syntax check produces a warning. All parameters defined there can be used exactly once. Valid [SAP annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_sap.htm) @parameter\_annot can be specified before these as [parameter annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_parameter_annotations.htm). It is not possible here to specify annotations after the name of a parameter pname with the syntax @<parameter\_annot.

At least one parameter pname of the extended entity must be specified after PARAMETERS. At least one parameter annotation [@parameter\_annot](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_parameter_annotations.htm) must be specified before each parameter of the list. If this is not the case, PARAMETERS cannot be used.

Hints

-   A parameter must be specified directly with its name. It cannot be specified using the syntax :pname or $parameters.pname, which is used within the entity for its addressing (parameter passing in CDS view entities is described [here](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_parameters_v2.htm), parameter passing in CDS DDIC-based views is described [here](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_parameters_v1.htm)).
-   Parameter annotations can be specified here only if this is allowed in their [annotation definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_anno_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") using the annotation [@MetadataExtension.usageAllowed:true](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_anno_annos.htm).
-   A parameter that is not in the parameter list of the entity is handled like a regular parameter in the [evaluation of annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_analysis.htm) with the class CL\_DD\_DDL\_ANNOTATION\_SERVICE.
-   The program ABAP\_DOCU\_MDE\_ANNOS shows all annotations that can be specified in metadata extensions.

Effect

Specifies annotations in a [CDS metadata extension](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_metadata_extension_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") introduced with [ANNOTATE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_annotate_view.htm) for the following:

-   [Elements](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_absent_list_element.htm) in the [element list](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_absent_element_list.htm) of an [CDS abstract entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_abstract_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")
-   [Elements](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_entry_v2.htm) in the [SELECT list](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_v2.htm) of a [CDS view entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_v2_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")
-   [Elements](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_entry_v1.htm) in the [SELECT list](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_v1.htm) of a [CDS DDIC-based view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_v1_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")

A semicolon-separated list element1; element2; ...; prefixed with annotations element\_annot can be specified in the curly brackets of the statement ANNOTATE. There must be a semicolon after the last element of the list.

Each specified element element should appear in the SELECT list of the entity that is annotated using ANNOTATE. If not, the syntax check produces a warning. An externally visible element name must be used. For [CDS DDIC-based views](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_v1_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), this is either the direct name, an alternative element name defined with [AS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_entry_v1.htm), or the name defined in a [name list](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_name_list_v1.htm). For [CDS view entities](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_v2_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), this is either the direct name, or an alternative element name defined with [AS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_entry_v2.htm).

All elements of the SELECT list can be used exactly once. Valid [SAP annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_sap.htm) @element\_annot can be specified before these as [element annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_element_annotation.htm). It is not possible here to specify annotations after the name of an element element with the syntax @<element\_annot.

At least one element annotation@element\_annot must be specified before each element of the list. However, the curly brackets of the ANNOTATE statement can also be empty.

Hints

-   An element must be specified directly with its name. It cannot be specified using names with multiple parts separated by periods, which can be used within the entity for its definition.
-   Element annotations can be specified here only if this is allowed in their [annotation definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_anno_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") using the annotation [@MetadataExtension.usageAllowed:true](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_anno_annos.htm).
-   An element that is not in the element list of the entity is handled like a regular element in the [evaluation of annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_analysis.htm) with the class CL\_DD\_DDL\_ANNOTATION\_SERVICE.
-   The program ABAP\_DOCU\_MDE\_ANNOS shows all annotations that can be specified in metadata extensions.

Defines a [CDS metadata extension](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_metadata_extension_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") (MDE for short) in dedicated [DDLX source code](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddlx_source_code_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

-   ANNOTATE ENTITY
    
    Defines an MDE for any [CDS entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") except [CDS table functions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_table_function_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
    
-   ANNOTATE VIEW
    
    Defines an MDE specifically for a [CDS view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
    

The CDS metadata extension adds metadata to a CDS entity as [CDS annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The entity in question must exist, be specified using the name of its [CDS entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") cds\_entity or cds\_view, and contain the annotationMetadata.allowExtensions with the default value true in its source code. A CDS entity can have more than one CDS metadata extension.

The annotation [@Metadata.layer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_metadata_ext_annos.htm) must be specified with one of the enumeration symbols shown in the example in front of the statement ANNOTATE to define the layer of the metadata extension. In the [analysis of metadata extensions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_meta_data_extension_eval.htm), the layer determines the priority of the metadata if there are multiple metadata extensions for the same CDS entity that is linked with the same [CDS variant](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_variant_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or not linked with any variants. The enumeration symbols are listed with the lowest priority ones on the left and the highest priority on the right. #CORE therefore has the lowest, and #CUSTOMER the highest priority. If multiple CDS metadata extensions with none or the same CDS variant are assigned to the same layer, a syntax check warning is issued for annotations specified more than one, and the system uses the annotation of the first metadata extension found.

The annotations added to the extended entity are defined as follows. A metadata extension must contain at least one of these.

-   Annotations in front of the statement ANNOTATE
    -   Only entity annotations @entity\_annot can be specified in front of the statement ANNOTATE ENTITY. Valid [SAP annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_sap.htm) must be in the [scope](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_scopes.htm) of the [entity annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_entity_annotations.htm). They are added to the entity annotations of the extended entity.
    -   Entity annotations and view annotations @view\_annot can be specified in front of the statement ANNOTATE VIEW. Valid [SAP annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_sap.htm) must be in the [scope](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_scopes.htm) of the [view annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_entity_anno.htm). They are added to the view annotations of the extended view.
-   [parameter\_list](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_annotate_view_para_list.htm) is used to specify annotations for the parameters of the extended entity.
-   [element\_list](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_annotate_view_sele_list.htm) is used specify annotations for the elements of SELECT list of the extended entity.

In metadata extensions, only those annotations can be specified for which this is allowed in their [annotation definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_anno_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") using the annotation [@MetadataExtension.usageAllowed:true](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_anno_annos.htm). In the CDS metadata extension, an annotation can be used in the same scope defined using [@Scope](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_anno_annos.htm) as in a data definition. All other annotations produce syntax errors.

These annotations of a metadata extension are respected in the [evaluation of annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_analysis.htm) with the methods of the class CL\_DD\_DDL\_ANNOTATION\_SERVICE except for GET\_DIRECT\_ANNOS\_, in accordance with the layers defined by the annotation @Metadata.layer and in accordance with the used [CDS variants](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_variant_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). Here the annotations of a metadata extension always have a higher priority than the annotations specified in the source code of the CDS entity. These are only respected if they are not overridden by a corresponding annotation of a metadata extension. For the exact description of the evaluation, see section [evaluation of metadata extensions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_meta_data_extension_eval.htm).

Hints

-   Unlike the specification of annotations in the source code of the extended CDS entity, it is not possible to have any arbitrary annotations in metadata extensions; it is only possible to have [SAP annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_sap.htm). The syntax check for a metadata extension checks the validity of its specification with respect to the [annotation definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_anno_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"):
    -   the name of an annotation
    -   the validity of the [annotation values](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenannotation_value_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), the type, and (for enumerations) the enumeration symbol
    -   the [scope](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_scopes.htm)
    -   whether any [annotation arrays](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenannotation_array_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") are specified correctly (they must only be specified using square brackets). The format @annot: value is not possible. @annot: \[value\] must be used instead. The array can contain only similar elements (in accordance with its definition).
-   The annotations (of a CDS entity) specified in metadata extensions does not have any effect on the activation or the behavior at runtime. They are only respected by the class CL\_DD\_DDL\_ANNOTATION\_SERVICE.
-   The program ABAP\_DOCU\_MDE\_ANNOS shows all annotations that can be specified in metadata extensions.

Example

The following metadata extension named DEMO\_CDS\_METADATA\_EXTENSION adds annotations with original language "German" to the CDS view DEMO\_CDS\_PARAMETERS from the executable example for [CDS views with parameters](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenselect_cds_para_abexa.htm). The program DEMO\_CDS\_META\_DATA\_EXTENSIONS reads the annotations of the view with the methods of the classes CL\_DD\_DDL\_ANNOTATION\_SERVICE and CL\_DD\_DDL\_ANALYZE. The method GET\_ANNOS of the class CL\_DD\_DDL\_ANNOTATION\_SERVICE covers both the annotations specified in the metadata extension and the translations into the current text environment language. The method GET\_ANNOTATIONS of the class CL\_DD\_DDL\_ANALYZE only evaluates the specifications in the view DEMO\_CDS\_PARAMETERS.

@Metadata.layer:#INDUSTRY
              
@EndUserText.label: 'Demo for View with Parameters'
annotate view demo\_cds\_parameters with
  parameters
    @EndUserText.label: 'Lower limit for distance'
    p\_distance\_l,
    @EndUserText.label: 'Upper limit for distance'
    p\_distance\_u,

    p\_unit
{

  @EndUserText.label: 'Arrival in city'
  cityto;
  @EndUserText.label: 'Flight distance'
  distance;
  @EndUserText.label: 'Unit of flight distance'
  distid;
};

Example

The following metadata extension DEMO\_CDS\_MDE\_FOR\_ABSTR\_ENT adds entity annotations and element annotations to the [CDS abstract entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_abstract_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") DEMO\_CDS\_ABSTRACT\_ENTITY\_ELEM from the example for its [element annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_absent_list_annotation.htm).

@Metadata.layer: #CORE
@EndUserText.label : 'Label from MDE'
annotate entity demo\_cds\_abstract\_entity\_elem with
  {
    @EndUserText.quickInfo: 'Quickinfo from MDE'
    col2;
  }

Addition   

... VARIANT variant

Effect

Links the metadata extension with a [CDS variant](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_variant_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). An existing CDS variant must be specified for variant. This entry is not case sensitive. If there are multiple metadata extensions for the same CDS entity contained in the layer defined with annotation @Metadata.layer, these extensions should be assigned to CDS variants, because otherwise a warning is raised by the syntax check for duplicate annotations.

In [evaluations of annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_analysis.htm) using the class CL\_DD\_DDL\_ANNOTATION\_SERVICE, the CDS variant can be specified to select the metadata extension. The class collects the annotations that it returned, in accordance with the layers and variants in line with the hierarchy described under the [evaluation of metadata extensions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_meta_data_extension_eval.htm).

Hints

-   [CDS variants](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_variant_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") are created in the [ADT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_variant_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and this creation process is documented there too.
-   From a technical perspective, the annotations specified in metadata extensions for a CDS entity are similar to the annotations specified in the [DDL source code](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddl_source_code_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), separated by layers and variants in separate system tables and made accessible using an API. Annotations with [translatable texts](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_analysis.htm) are also stored here in tables, which are connected to translation. The class CL\_DD\_DDL\_ANNOTATION\_SERVICE evaluates the system tables.

Caution

CDS variants are not currently released for general use. It is not possible to define standalone CDS variants and the use of CDS variants in metadata extensions produces a syntax check warning.

Effect

Defines a [CDS metadata extension](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_metadata_extension_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") (MDE for short) in dedicated [DDLX source code](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddlx_source_code_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

-   ANNOTATE ENTITY
    
    Defines an MDE for any [CDS entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") except [CDS table functions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_table_function_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
    
-   ANNOTATE VIEW
    
    Defines an MDE specifically for a [CDS view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
    

The CDS metadata extension adds metadata to a CDS entity as [CDS annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The entity in question must exist, be specified using the name of its [CDS entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") cds\_entity or cds\_view, and contain the annotationMetadata.allowExtensions with the default value true in its source code. A CDS entity can have more than one CDS metadata extension.

The annotation [@Metadata.layer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_metadata_ext_annos.htm) must be specified with one of the enumeration symbols shown in the example in front of the statement ANNOTATE to define the layer of the metadata extension. In the [analysis of metadata extensions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_meta_data_extension_eval.htm), the layer determines the priority of the metadata if there are multiple metadata extensions for the same CDS entity that is linked with the same [CDS variant](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_variant_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or not linked with any variants. The enumeration symbols are listed with the lowest priority ones on the left and the highest priority on the right. #CORE therefore has the lowest, and #CUSTOMER the highest priority. If multiple CDS metadata extensions with none or the same CDS variant are assigned to the same layer, a syntax check warning is issued for annotations specified more than one, and the system uses the annotation of the first metadata extension found.

The annotations added to the extended entity are defined as follows. A metadata extension must contain at least one of these.

-   Annotations in front of the statement ANNOTATE
    -   Only entity annotations @entity\_annot can be specified in front of the statement ANNOTATE ENTITY. Valid [SAP annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_sap.htm) must be in the [scope](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_scopes.htm) of the [entity annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_entity_annotations.htm). They are added to the entity annotations of the extended entity.
    -   Entity annotations and view annotations @view\_annot can be specified in front of the statement ANNOTATE VIEW. Valid [SAP annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_sap.htm) must be in the [scope](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_scopes.htm) of the [view annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_entity_anno.htm). They are added to the view annotations of the extended view.
-   [parameter\_list](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_annotate_view_para_list.htm) is used to specify annotations for the parameters of the extended entity.
-   [element\_list](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_annotate_view_sele_list.htm) is used specify annotations for the elements of SELECT list of the extended entity.

In metadata extensions, only those annotations can be specified for which this is allowed in their [annotation definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_anno_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") using the annotation [@MetadataExtension.usageAllowed:true](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_anno_annos.htm). In the CDS metadata extension, an annotation can be used in the same scope defined using [@Scope](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_anno_annos.htm) as in a data definition. All other annotations produce syntax errors.

These annotations of a metadata extension are respected in the [evaluation of annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_analysis.htm) with the methods of the class CL\_DD\_DDL\_ANNOTATION\_SERVICE except for GET\_DIRECT\_ANNOS\_, in accordance with the layers defined by the annotation @Metadata.layer and in accordance with the used [CDS variants](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_variant_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). Here the annotations of a metadata extension always have a higher priority than the annotations specified in the source code of the CDS entity. These are only respected if they are not overridden by a corresponding annotation of a metadata extension. For the exact description of the evaluation, see section [evaluation of metadata extensions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_meta_data_extension_eval.htm).

Hints

-   Unlike the specification of annotations in the source code of the extended CDS entity, it is not possible to have any arbitrary annotations in metadata extensions; it is only possible to have [SAP annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_sap.htm). The syntax check for a metadata extension checks the validity of its specification with respect to the [annotation definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_anno_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"):
    -   the name of an annotation
    -   the validity of the [annotation values](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenannotation_value_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), the type, and (for enumerations) the enumeration symbol
    -   the [scope](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_scopes.htm)
    -   whether any [annotation arrays](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenannotation_array_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") are specified correctly (they must only be specified using square brackets). The format @annot: value is not possible. @annot: \[value\] must be used instead. The array can contain only similar elements (in accordance with its definition).
-   The annotations (of a CDS entity) specified in metadata extensions does not have any effect on the activation or the behavior at runtime. They are only respected by the class CL\_DD\_DDL\_ANNOTATION\_SERVICE.
-   The program ABAP\_DOCU\_MDE\_ANNOS shows all annotations that can be specified in metadata extensions.

Example

The following metadata extension named DEMO\_CDS\_METADATA\_EXTENSION adds annotations with original language "German" to the CDS view DEMO\_CDS\_PARAMETERS from the executable example for [CDS views with parameters](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenselect_cds_para_abexa.htm). The program DEMO\_CDS\_META\_DATA\_EXTENSIONS reads the annotations of the view with the methods of the classes CL\_DD\_DDL\_ANNOTATION\_SERVICE and CL\_DD\_DDL\_ANALYZE. The method GET\_ANNOS of the class CL\_DD\_DDL\_ANNOTATION\_SERVICE covers both the annotations specified in the metadata extension and the translations into the current text environment language. The method GET\_ANNOTATIONS of the class CL\_DD\_DDL\_ANALYZE only evaluates the specifications in the view DEMO\_CDS\_PARAMETERS.

@Metadata.layer:#INDUSTRY
              
@EndUserText.label: 'Demo for View with Parameters'
annotate view demo\_cds\_parameters with

    @EndUserText.label: 'Lower limit for distance'

  cityto;
  @EndUserText.label: 'Flight distance'
  distance;
  @EndUserText.label: 'Unit of flight distance'
  distid;
};

Example

The following metadata extension DEMO\_CDS\_MDE\_FOR\_ABSTR\_ENT adds entity annotations and element annotations to the [CDS abstract entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_abstract_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") DEMO\_CDS\_ABSTRACT\_ENTITY\_ELEM from the example for its [element annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_absent_list_annotation.htm).

@Metadata.layer: #CORE
@EndUserText.label : 'Label from MDE'
annotate entity demo\_cds\_abstract\_entity\_elem with
  {
    @EndUserText.quickInfo: 'Quickinfo from MDE'
    col2;
  }

Addition   

... VARIANT variant

Effect

Links the metadata extension with a [CDS variant](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_variant_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). An existing CDS variant must be specified for variant. This entry is not case sensitive. If there are multiple metadata extensions for the same CDS entity contained in the layer defined with annotation @Metadata.layer, these extensions should be assigned to CDS variants, because otherwise a warning is raised by the syntax check for duplicate annotations.

In [evaluations of annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_analysis.htm) using the class CL\_DD\_DDL\_ANNOTATION\_SERVICE, the CDS variant can be specified to select the metadata extension. The class collects the annotations that it returned, in accordance with the layers and variants in line with the hierarchy described under the [evaluation of metadata extensions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_meta_data_extension_eval.htm).

Hints

-   [CDS variants](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_variant_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") are created in the [ADT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_variant_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and this creation process is documented there too.
-   From a technical perspective, the annotations specified in metadata extensions for a CDS entity are similar to the annotations specified in the [DDL source code](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddl_source_code_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), separated by layers and variants in separate system tables and made accessible using an API. Annotations with [translatable texts](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_analysis.htm) are also stored here in tables, which are connected to translation. The class CL\_DD\_DDL\_ANNOTATION\_SERVICE evaluates the system tables.

Caution

CDS variants are not currently released for general use. It is not possible to define standalone CDS variants and the use of CDS variants in metadata extensions produces a syntax check warning.

Effect

Specifies annotations for the following parameters:

-   [Parameter list](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_entity_parameter_list.htm) of an [CDS abstract entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_abstract_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")
-   [Parameter list](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_parameter_list_v2.htm) of a [CDS view entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_v2_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")
-   [Parameter list](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_parameter_list_v1.htm) of a [CDS DDIC-based view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_v1_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")

The parameters in a [CDS metadata extension](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_metadata_extension_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") introduced using [ANNOTATE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_annotate_view.htm). A comma-separated list pname1, pname2, ... prefixed with annotations @parameter\_annot can be specified after PARAMETERS. There must not be comma after the last element of the list.

Each parameter pname specified after PARAMETERS should appear in the parameter list of the entity extended using ANNOTATE. If not, the syntax check produces a warning. All parameters defined there can be used exactly once. Valid [SAP annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_sap.htm) @parameter\_annot can be specified before these as [parameter annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_parameter_annotations.htm). It is not possible here to specify annotations after the name of a parameter pname with the syntax @<parameter\_annot.

At least one parameter pname of the extended entity must be specified after PARAMETERS. At least one parameter annotation [@parameter\_annot](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_parameter_annotations.htm) must be specified before each parameter of the list. If this is not the case, PARAMETERS cannot be used.

Hints

-   A parameter must be specified directly with its name. It cannot be specified using the syntax :pname or $parameters.pname, which is used within the entity for its addressing (parameter passing in CDS view entities is described [here](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_parameters_v2.htm), parameter passing in CDS DDIC-based views is described [here](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_parameters_v1.htm)).
-   Parameter annotations can be specified here only if this is allowed in their [annotation definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_anno_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") using the annotation [@MetadataExtension.usageAllowed:true](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_anno_annos.htm).
-   A parameter that is not in the parameter list of the entity is handled like a regular parameter in the [evaluation of annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_analysis.htm) with the class CL\_DD\_DDL\_ANNOTATION\_SERVICE.
-   The program ABAP\_DOCU\_MDE\_ANNOS shows all annotations that can be specified in metadata extensions.

-   [Elements](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_absent_list_element.htm) in the [element list](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_absent_element_list.htm) of an [CDS abstract entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_abstract_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")
-   [Elements](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_entry_v2.htm) in the [SELECT list](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_v2.htm) of a [CDS view entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_v2_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")
-   [Elements](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_entry_v1.htm) in the [SELECT list](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_v1.htm) of a [CDS DDIC-based view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_v1_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")

A semicolon-separated list element1; element2; ...; prefixed with annotations element\_annot can be specified in the curly brackets of the statement ANNOTATE. There must be a semicolon after the last element of the list.

Each specified element element should appear in the SELECT list of the entity that is annotated using ANNOTATE. If not, the syntax check produces a warning. An externally visible element name must be used. For [CDS DDIC-based views](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_v1_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), this is either the direct name, an alternative element name defined with [AS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_entry_v1.htm), or the name defined in a [name list](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_name_list_v1.htm). For [CDS view entities](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_v2_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), this is either the direct name, or an alternative element name defined with [AS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_entry_v2.htm).

All elements of the SELECT list can be used exactly once. Valid [SAP annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_sap.htm) @element\_annot can be specified before these as [element annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_element_annotation.htm). It is not possible here to specify annotations after the name of an element element with the syntax @<element\_annot.

At least one element annotation@element\_annot must be specified before each element of the list. However, the curly brackets of the ANNOTATE statement can also be empty.

Hints

-   An element must be specified directly with its name. It cannot be specified using names with multiple parts separated by periods, which can be used within the entity for its definition.
-   Element annotations can be specified here only if this is allowed in their [annotation definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_anno_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") using the annotation [@MetadataExtension.usageAllowed:true](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_anno_annos.htm).
-   An element that is not in the element list of the entity is handled like a regular element in the [evaluation of annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_analysis.htm) with the class CL\_DD\_DDL\_ANNOTATION\_SERVICE.
-   The program ABAP\_DOCU\_MDE\_ANNOS shows all annotations that can be specified in metadata extensions.

Effect

Defines a [CDS metadata extension](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_metadata_extension_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") (MDE for short) in dedicated [DDLX source code](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddlx_source_code_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

-   ANNOTATE ENTITY
    
    Defines an MDE for any [CDS entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") except [CDS table functions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_table_function_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
    
-   ANNOTATE VIEW
    
    Defines an MDE specifically for a [CDS view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
    

The CDS metadata extension adds metadata to a CDS entity as [CDS annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The entity in question must exist, be specified using the name of its [CDS entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") cds\_entity or cds\_view, and contain the annotationMetadata.allowExtensions with the default value true in its source code. A CDS entity can have more than one CDS metadata extension.

The annotation [@Metadata.layer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_metadata_ext_annos.htm) must be specified with one of the enumeration symbols shown in the example in front of the statement ANNOTATE to define the layer of the metadata extension. In the [analysis of metadata extensions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_meta_data_extension_eval.htm), the layer determines the priority of the metadata if there are multiple metadata extensions for the same CDS entity that is linked with the same [CDS variant](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_variant_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or not linked with any variants. The enumeration symbols are listed with the lowest priority ones on the left and the highest priority on the right. #CORE therefore has the lowest, and #CUSTOMER the highest priority. If multiple CDS metadata extensions with none or the same CDS variant are assigned to the same layer, a syntax check warning is issued for annotations specified more than one, and the system uses the annotation of the first metadata extension found.

The annotations added to the extended entity are defined as follows. A metadata extension must contain at least one of these.

-   Annotations in front of the statement ANNOTATE
    -   Only entity annotations @entity\_annot can be specified in front of the statement ANNOTATE ENTITY. Valid [SAP annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_sap.htm) must be in the [scope](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_scopes.htm) of the [entity annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_entity_annotations.htm). They are added to the entity annotations of the extended entity.
    -   Entity annotations and view annotations @view\_annot can be specified in front of the statement ANNOTATE VIEW. Valid [SAP annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_sap.htm) must be in the [scope](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_scopes.htm) of the [view annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_entity_anno.htm). They are added to the view annotations of the extended view.
-   [parameter\_list](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_annotate_view_para_list.htm) is used to specify annotations for the parameters of the extended entity.
-   [element\_list](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_annotate_view_sele_list.htm) is used specify annotations for the elements of SELECT list of the extended entity.

In metadata extensions, only those annotations can be specified for which this is allowed in their [annotation definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_anno_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") using the annotation [@MetadataExtension.usageAllowed:true](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_anno_annos.htm). In the CDS metadata extension, an annotation can be used in the same scope defined using [@Scope](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_anno_annos.htm) as in a data definition. All other annotations produce syntax errors.

These annotations of a metadata extension are respected in the [evaluation of annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_analysis.htm) with the methods of the class CL\_DD\_DDL\_ANNOTATION\_SERVICE except for GET\_DIRECT\_ANNOS\_, in accordance with the layers defined by the annotation @Metadata.layer and in accordance with the used [CDS variants](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_variant_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). Here the annotations of a metadata extension always have a higher priority than the annotations specified in the source code of the CDS entity. These are only respected if they are not overridden by a corresponding annotation of a metadata extension. For the exact description of the evaluation, see section [evaluation of metadata extensions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_meta_data_extension_eval.htm).

Hints

-   Unlike the specification of annotations in the source code of the extended CDS entity, it is not possible to have any arbitrary annotations in metadata extensions; it is only possible to have [SAP annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_sap.htm). The syntax check for a metadata extension checks the validity of its specification with respect to the [annotation definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_anno_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"):
    -   the name of an annotation
    -   the validity of the [annotation values](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenannotation_value_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), the type, and (for enumerations) the enumeration symbol
    -   the [scope](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_scopes.htm)
    -   whether any [annotation arrays](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenannotation_array_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") are specified correctly (they must only be specified using square brackets). The format @annot: value is not possible. @annot: \[value\] must be used instead. The array can contain only similar elements (in accordance with its definition).
-   The annotations (of a CDS entity) specified in metadata extensions does not have any effect on the activation or the behavior at runtime. They are only respected by the class CL\_DD\_DDL\_ANNOTATION\_SERVICE.
-   The program ABAP\_DOCU\_MDE\_ANNOS shows all annotations that can be specified in metadata extensions.

Example

The following metadata extension named DEMO\_CDS\_METADATA\_EXTENSION adds annotations with original language "German" to the CDS view DEMO\_CDS\_PARAMETERS from the executable example for [CDS views with parameters](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenselect_cds_para_abexa.htm). The program DEMO\_CDS\_META\_DATA\_EXTENSIONS reads the annotations of the view with the methods of the classes CL\_DD\_DDL\_ANNOTATION\_SERVICE and CL\_DD\_DDL\_ANALYZE. The method GET\_ANNOS of the class CL\_DD\_DDL\_ANNOTATION\_SERVICE covers both the annotations specified in the metadata extension and the translations into the current text environment language. The method GET\_ANNOTATIONS of the class CL\_DD\_DDL\_ANALYZE only evaluates the specifications in the view DEMO\_CDS\_PARAMETERS.

};

Example

The following metadata extension DEMO\_CDS\_MDE\_FOR\_ABSTR\_ENT adds entity annotations and element annotations to the [CDS abstract entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_abstract_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") DEMO\_CDS\_ABSTRACT\_ENTITY\_ELEM from the example for its [element annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_absent_list_annotation.htm).

@Metadata.layer: #CORE
@EndUserText.label : 'Label from MDE'
annotate entity demo\_cds\_abstract\_entity\_elem with
  {
    @EndUserText.quickInfo: 'Quickinfo from MDE'
    col2;

Addition   

... VARIANT variant

Effect

Links the metadata extension with a [CDS variant](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_variant_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). An existing CDS variant must be specified for variant. This entry is not case sensitive. If there are multiple metadata extensions for the same CDS entity contained in the layer defined with annotation @Metadata.layer, these extensions should be assigned to CDS variants, because otherwise a warning is raised by the syntax check for duplicate annotations.

In [evaluations of annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_analysis.htm) using the class CL\_DD\_DDL\_ANNOTATION\_SERVICE, the CDS variant can be specified to select the metadata extension. The class collects the annotations that it returned, in accordance with the layers and variants in line with the hierarchy described under the [evaluation of metadata extensions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_meta_data_extension_eval.htm).

Hints

-   [CDS variants](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_variant_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") are created in the [ADT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_variant_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and this creation process is documented there too.
-   From a technical perspective, the annotations specified in metadata extensions for a CDS entity are similar to the annotations specified in the [DDL source code](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddl_source_code_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), separated by layers and variants in separate system tables and made accessible using an API. Annotations with [translatable texts](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_analysis.htm) are also stored here in tables, which are connected to translation. The class CL\_DD\_DDL\_ANNOTATION\_SERVICE evaluates the system tables.

Caution

CDS variants are not currently released for general use. It is not possible to define standalone CDS variants and the use of CDS variants in metadata extensions produces a syntax check warning.

ABAP CDS - Evaluation of Annotations

When an object defined in the [CDS source code](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_source_code_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is activated, the annotations defined in the [CDS annotation syntax](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotation_syntax_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") there are saved in internal system tables. These tables can then be accessed to evaluate the data. This is done for every annotation with correct syntax regardless of name and value.

System Class CL\_DD\_DDL\_ANNOTATION\_SERVICE

The following documented system class is provided for evaluations of the annotations of [CDS entities](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"):

CL\_DD\_DDL\_ANNOTATION\_SERVICE

The methods of this class return the annotations of CDS entities. By default, the annotations are returned from [metadata extensions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_metadata_extension_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") first, and then from the CDS entity itself. In the latter case, a distinction can be made between direct, derived and inherited annotations, while in the case of inherited annotations the [metadata extensions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_metadata_extension_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") (if present) are handled first. More specifically, an initial annotation value is returned in cases where an annotation has no values specified, rather than any default value defined in the annotation definition.

Hints

-   The method GET\_ANNOTATIONS of the class CL\_DD\_DDL\_ANALYZE also returns the annotations of CDS entities. It must be noted, however, that these only analyze the associated DDL source code. Annotations from metadata extensions, derived and inherited annotations, and the translations of annotations for translatable texts are ignored.
-   When the system class CL\_DD\_DDL\_ANNOTATION\_SERVICE is used to evaluate annotations, the annotations of the CDS entities are also respected, as specified in their [DDL source code](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddl_source_code_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in [CDS annotation syntax](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotation_syntax_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The associated [annotation definitions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_anno_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") are ignored by CL\_DD\_DDL\_ANNOTATION\_SERVICE. The validity of an annotation must be checked by the responsible framework.
-   [ADT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenadt_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") supports the specification of valid annotations (namely annotations with an [annotation definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_anno_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")) by using colors in the source code and code completion.
-   The annotations [Semantics.amount.currencyCode](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_element_annotation.htm) and [Semantics.quantity.unitofMeasure](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_element_annotation.htm) can be derived from DDIC database tables only if the name of the referred currency key or unit key field isn't changed in a CDS view entity. If a CDS view entity selecting from a database table uses an alias name for a currency key or unit key field, then the annotation can't be evaluated by the API CL\_DD\_DDL\_ANNOTATION\_SERVICE.

Metadata Extensions

[Metadata extensions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_meta_data_extensions.htm) add further annotations to a CDS entity or override existing annotations. Currently metadata extensions can be defined for [CDS views](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and [CDS abstract entities](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_abstract_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). Only those annotations can be added to metadata extensions, that are ignored when the CDS entity is activated.

The methods of the class CL\_DD\_DDL\_ANNOTATION\_SERVICE (except GET\_DIRECT\_ANNOS\_...) [respect](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_meta_data_extension_eval.htm) by default the existing metadata extensions in the current AS ABAP when the annotations of a CDS entity are evaluated. There can be multiple metadata extensions for an entity. These extensions can be distinguished by assignments to various layers, such as industry, partner, and customer, and by the association with [CDS variants](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_variant_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The methods of the class CL\_DD\_DDL\_ANNOTATION\_SERVICE collect all annotations belonging to the CDS entity in the following order:

-   Annotations from metadata extensions
-   Direct annotations from the data definition
-   Indirect annotations (derived and inherited annotations)

Here every annotation is only returned once for its scope. If annotations have the same name, the priority is determined first by the explicit specification of a CDS variant when the method is called, and then by the layers of the involved metadata extensions. The evaluation is performed using the following [steps](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_meta_data_extension_eval.htm):

-   First the metadata extensions of the specified variant are evaluated. Here, an annotation of a higher level overrides the annotation of a lower layer.
-   Then the metadata extensions are evaluated, which are not linked to any variants. Once again, higher levels override lower levels.
-   Finally, the direct and indirect annotations of the CDS entity are evaluated. In the evaluation of the annotations inherited from the other CDS entities, any metadata extensions are taken into account first.

Annotations found in an earlier evaluation level always have the higher priority. An annotation from a later level is only returned if it has already been found in an earlier level. The results of the class CL\_DD\_DDL\_ANNOTATION\_SERVICE show where an annotation was specified.

Hints

-   Annotations from metadata extensions are not stored in the same system tables as annotations from the DDL source code of a CDS entity. They can only be made accessible by using the class CL\_DD\_DDL\_ANNOTATION\_SERVICE. Other classes ignore metadata extensions.
-   For more information and examples related to evaluation, see [metadata extensions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_meta_data_extensions.htm) and [evaluation of metadata extensions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_meta_data_extension_eval.htm).
-   The program ABAP\_DOCU\_MDE\_ANNOS shows all annotations that can be specified in metadata extensions.

Caution

CDS variants are not currently released for general use. It is not possible to define standalone CDS variants and the use of CDS variants in metadata extensions produces a syntax check warning.

Direct, Inherited, and Derived Annotations

In the evaluation of annotations of a CDS entity using methods of the class CL\_DD\_DDL\_ANNOTATION\_SERVICE, which cannot be overridden by metadata extensions, it is possible to distinguish between the following types of annotations:

-   Direct annotations
    
    In the [annotation syntax](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_syntax.htm), these annotations are specified directly in the DDL source code of the CDS entity currently being evaluated. The methods GET\_DIRECT\_ANNOS\_ of the class CL\_DD\_DDL\_ANNOTATION\_SERVICE only read these annotations.
    
-   Indirect annotations
    
    In addition to returning direct annotations, the methods of the class CL\_DD\_DDL\_ANNOTATION\_SERVICE (except for GET\_DIRECT\_ANNOS\_) also return annotations that are not specified in the DDL source code:
    
    -   Inherited annotations
        
        If these annotations are not specified explicitly in the DDL source code of the CDS entity, they are taken from the dictionary objects used in the CDS entity, in accordance with the rules described in the class documentation of CL\_DD\_DDL\_ANNOTATION\_SERVICE. When other CDS entities are accessed, their annotations specified in metadata extensions, direct annotations, and derived annotations are inherited. Other dictionary objects, such as DDIC database tables and DDIC views, do not have any direct annotations. However, their annotations derived from assigned data elements are inherited. The view annotation Metadata.ignorePropagatedAnnotations can be used to specify whether the class CL\_DD\_DDL\_ANNOTATION\_SERVICE takes into account or ignores inherited annotations.
        
    -   Derived annotations
        
        If these annotations are not explicitly specified or inherited in the DDL source code of the CDS entity, they are derived (if possible) from assigned data elements of ABAP Dictionary. The relevant annotations are the element and parameter annotations @EndUserText.Label, @EndUserText.QuickInfo and @EndUserText.Heading, which are supplied with texts according to rules (described in the class documentation CL\_DD\_DDL\_ANNOTATION\_SERVICE) from the field labels of assigned data elements. The annotation @EndUserText.Heading is only currently possible as an implicit annotation for this purpose. If specified directly in the DDL source code of a data definition, an annotation is not recognized as a language-dependent text. @EndUserText.Heading is also not allowed in the [DDLX source code](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddlx_source_code_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of a [metadata extension](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_meta_data_extensions.htm).
        

Hints

-   Inheritances apply especially to those [element annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_element_annotation.htm) of [CDS associations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_association_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") exposed in the SELECT list of a CDS entity using a path expression path\_expr. A publication of a CDS association specified in a different CDS view inherits the element annotations of preceding publications.
-   Annotations derived from data elements depend on the assignment of data elements to elements of the current CDS entity. This assignment is performed in the internal metadata of a CDS entity and is not dependent on inheritance.
-   The annotations types described here apply especially to evaluations using the class CL\_DD\_DDL\_ANNOTATION\_SERVICE. Other APIs can evaluate the underlying metadata differently.

Example

The following three pieces of [DDL source code](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddl_source_code_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") define three views; the first two views access the third view. The only difference between the first two views is the specification of annotation @Metadata.ignorePropagatedAnnotations:true. Every view contains an element with a direct element annotation @EndUserText.label.

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_ANIN1'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
define view demo\_cds\_anno\_inheritance\_1
  as select from
    demo\_cds\_anno\_inheritance\_2
    {
          @EndUserText.label: 'XXXXXXXXXX'
      key id,
      key carrier,
      key flight,
          departure,
          destination
    }  

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_ANIN1A'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
@Metadata.ignorePropagatedAnnotations: true
define view demo\_cds\_anno\_inheritance\_1A
  as select from
    demo\_cds\_anno\_inheritance\_2
    {
          @EndUserText.label: 'XXXXXXXXXX'
      key id,
      key carrier,
      key flight,
          departure,
          destination
    }  

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_ANIN2'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
define view demo\_cds\_anno\_inheritance\_2
  as select from
           spfli
      join scarr on
        scarr.carrid = spfli.carrid
    {
      key spfli.carrid                               as id,
      key scarr.carrname                             as carrier,
          @EndUserText.label: 'YYYYYYYYYY'
      key spfli.connid                               as flight,
          spfli.cityfrom                             as departure,
          cast( spfli.cityto as demo\_destination )   as destination
    }

The program DEMO\_CDS\_DERIVED\_INHERIT\_ANNOS uses a method of the class CL\_DD\_DDL\_ANNOTATION\_SERVICE to read the element annotations of the first two CDS views:

-   Almost all element annotations in this example are from annotations derived from data elements. This applies especially to the annotation @EndUserText.heading, which cannot be specified in the source code. The texts of the element destination originate from data element demo\_destination, which overrides the automatic assignment to S\_TO\_CITY in a CAST expression.
    -   Without the annotation @Metadata.ignorePropagatedAnnotations:true, the derived annotations are inherited from the used objects. The SOURCEOBJECT column contains the names of the objects.
    -   If annotation @Metadata.ignorePropagatedAnnotations:true is used, the derivation is performed in the current view and the column SOURCEOBJECT only shows names.
-   The value of annotation @EndUserText.label of element id originates from the annotation specified directly in the first two views.
-   The value of annotation @EndUserText.label of element flight originates in the first view from the annotation, which it inherits from the second view. In the second view, this inheritance is suppressed by the annotation @Metadata.ignorePropagatedAnnotations:true.

The ABAPCATALOG.INTERNAL.ISMANDT annotation that is visible in the output is an internal annotation, which indicates the client field of a client-dependent CDS entity.

Subannotations

In the [annotation syntax](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_syntax.htm), [subannotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abensub_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") are specified either as [comma-separated lists](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_syntax_subanno.htm) in curly brackets or using [structured names](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_syntax_name.htm). The way this metadata is saved internally is independent of the way it is specified and the methods of the class CL\_DD\_DDL\_ANNOTATION\_SERVICE always return subannotations as an individual annotation with a structured name.

Example

Subannotations specified as followed

@DemoAnno: {subAnno1: true,
            subAnno2: { subAnno1: 1,
                        subAnno2: { subAnno1: 1,
                                    subAnno2: 2 } } }

are the same as those specified as follows

@DemoAnno.subAnno1: true
@DemoAnno.subAnno2.subAnno1: 1
@DemoAnno.subAnno2.subAnno2.subAnno1: 1
@DemoAnno.subAnno2.subAnno2.subAnno2: 2

Evaluating either of the above using the method GET\_DIRECT\_ANNOS\_4\_ENTITY of the class CL\_DD\_DDL\_ANNOTATION\_SERVICE produces the following

ANNONAME

VALUE

DEMOANNO.SUBANNO1

true

DEMOANNO.SUBANNO2.SUBANNO1

1

DEMOANNO.SUBANNO2.SUBANNO2.SUBANNO1

1

DEMOANNO.SUBANNO2.SUBANNO2.SUBANNO2

2

Annotation Arrays

In the [annotation syntax](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_syntax.htm), [annotation arrays](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenannotation_array_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") are created using [comma-separated lists](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_syntax_array.htm) in square brackets after a specified annotation. When this metadata is saved internally, the elements of annotation arrays are saved as individual annotations. Here, they are saved under the name of the array. A consecutive index enclosed in $ characters $1$, $2$, ... is appended to this array. Accordingly, the methods of the class CL\_DD\_DDL\_ANNOTATION\_SERVICE return an array as individual annotations.

Hint

For annotation arrays, the [annotation syntax](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_syntax.htm) in DDL source code for [CDS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenannotation_array_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") entities is not as strict as the syntax of [DEFINE ANNOTATION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_annotation.htm) for [annotation definitions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_anno_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

-   Array elements do not always have to have the same type in the annotation syntax.
-   Arrays can be nested directly in the annotation syntax.

In the internal metadata (and hence in the results of the methods of the class CL\_DD\_DDL\_ANNOTATION\_SERVICE), array elements with non-matching types are returned just as specified in the annotation syntax. Directly nested arrays are not saved but they are counted when the elements are indexed.

Example

The [annotation array](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenannotation_array_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") specified as follows is valid [annotation syntax](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_syntax.htm), but it cannot have an [annotation definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_anno_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

@DemoAnno: \[ true,
             \[1,2,3\],
             { subAnno1:1, subAnno2:2} \]

The elements of the error do not have matching types and the second element is a directly nested array. The method GET\_DIRECT\_ANNOS\_4\_ENTITY of the class CL\_DD\_DDL\_ANNOTATION\_SERVICE produces the following:

ANNONAME

VALUE

DEMOANNO$1$

true

DEMOANNO$3$.SUBANNO1

1

DEMOANNO$3$.SUBANNO2

2

It should be noted that the nested array is counted but not returned.

Null Values

For each [element annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_element_annotation.htm) of a CDS entity that is not part of an [annotation array](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenannotation_array_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), the special value [null](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_syntax_value.htm) can be specified (without quotation marks). The value null leads to a syntax error at other positions. The value null means that the annotation is not returned by default by the methods of the class CL\_DD\_DDL\_ANNOTATION\_SERVICE. The default setting can be changed with the method input parameter NULL\_VALUES.

Hints

-   Null values are only intended to hide unwanted, derived and inherited annotations in the evaluation of the annotations of a CDS entity.
-   A null value is inherited like every value. A direct annotation of a CDS entity overwrites the annotations taken from used dictionary objects. This means any values can be overwritten with the null value; a null value itself can also be overwritten.
-   In the [DDLX source code](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddlx_source_code_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of [CDS metadata extensions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_metadata_extension_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), null values can be specified in exactly the same way as in the [DDL source code](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddl_source_code_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of a CDS entity.
-   The evaluation only filters the annotations out, if a null value has been specified for their identifiers.
    -   If specified, @annotation.annotation1:null only affects the identifier @annotation.annotation1 but does not affect, for example, @annotation.annotation1.annotation2.
    -   If the null value is specified for an [annotation array](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenannotation_array_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), this value affects the entire array. @annot:null specified for an inherited annotation array @annot:\[ ..., ..., ...\] is applied to all elements of the array.
-   The evaluation filters annotations with null values - completely regardless of whether they are predefined [SAP annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abensap_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or not.

Example

The following two [CDS source codes](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddl_source_code_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") define two views; the second view accesses the first view. In the first view, @EndUserText annotations with literal values are specified for every element of the SELECT list. In the second view, some of these values are overwritten with the value null. This occurs in the first view for the special annotation @EndUserText.heading.

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_NULL1'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
define view demo\_cds\_anno\_null\_value\_1
  as select from
           spfli
      join scarr on
        scarr.carrid = spfli.carrid
    {          
          @EndUserText.heading: null
          @EndUserText.label: 'ID'
          @EndUserText.quickInfo: 'ID'
      key spfli.carrid                               as id,
          @EndUserText.label: 'Carrier'
          @EndUserText.quickInfo: 'Carrier'
      key scarr.carrname                             as carrier,
          @EndUserText.label: 'Flight'
          @EndUserText.quickInfo: 'Flight'
      key spfli.connid                               as flight
    }  

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_NULL2'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
define view demo\_cds\_anno\_null\_value\_2
  as select from
    demo\_cds\_anno\_null\_value\_1
    {
          @EndUserText: null
      key id,
          @EndUserText.heading: null
          @EndUserText.label: null
      key carrier,
          @EndUserText.heading: null
          @EndUserText.quickInfo: null
      key flight
    }    

The program DEMO\_CDS\_NULL\_ANNOS uses a method of the class CL\_DD\_DDL\_ANNOTATION\_SERVICE to read the element annotations of the two CDS views. Annotations containing the value null in the second view are not reset.

-   The annotation @EndUserText: null is ignored in front of the element id. This annotation does not filter out all @EndUserText annotations of this element. This annotation would overwrite an element annotation @EndUserText: ... of the first view, which is not specified there since it is not a valid [ABAP annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenabap_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
-   The annotations @EndUserText.label: null and @EndUserText.quickInfo: null in front of the elements carrier or flight overwrite the values of the annotations, which were inherited from the first view. They are not returned by the evaluation.
-   The derived annotation @EndUserText.Heading is assigned the value null for every element. This occurs for in the first view for the element id. For this view, the evaluation returns the annotation for the other two elements. In the second view, the value null is also set for this view and the evaluation does not return the annotation @EndUserText.Heading for any of the elements of the CDS view.

Annotations for Translatable Texts

The annotation values of annotations for which this is defined in their [annotation definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_anno_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") (using the annotation [@LanguageDependency](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_anno_annos.htm)) are used to define translatable semantic texts for a [CDS object](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_object_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The value of such an annotation is saved in special tables that have a language key and that are translatable. The value specified in the source code should consist of text in the original language of the CDS source code and it is translated into the required languages. The methods of the class CL\_DD\_DDL\_ANNOTATION\_SERVICE read these texts as specified by an input parameter for the language. If no language is passed to the input parameter, the [text environment language](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abentext_env_langu_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is used as the default. If no text is found for the language, the [secondary language](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abensecondary_language_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in AS ABAP is used.

Hints

-   Even in [metadata extensions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_metadata_extension_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), the annotations for translatable texts are handled specially and are created in special tables, which are connected to the translation.
-   The program ABAP\_DOCU\_TRANSLATABLE\_ANNOS shows all annotations for translatable texts.

Example

The following [CDS source code](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddl_source_code_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), which defines a [CDS view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), contains the specific ABAP annotations that are introduced using EndUserText.

@EndUserText.label: 'Demo View with Texts'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_VIEW\_TEXTS'
define view demo\_cds\_text\_annotations
  with parameters
    @EndUserText.label:'Input Parameter'
    param : abap.int4
  as select from
    demo\_expressions
    {
      @EndUserText:{ label:'Element', quickInfo:'Field' }
      id
    }

The program DEMO\_CDS\_DDL\_TEXTS uses methods of the class CL\_DD\_DDL\_ANNOTATION\_SERVICE to access the associated texts in a language-dependent way. The original language of the view is English and the English texts must be available in every system. If a German translation exists, this is also read and displayed.

Performing the Evaluation

[ABAP annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenabap_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and [framework-specific annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenfrmwrk_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") are evaluated in different ways:

-   ABAP annotations
    
    [ABAP annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenabap_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") define technical and semantic attributes of a [CDS object](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_object_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). They are usually evaluated for every CDS object when activated by the [ABAP runtime framework](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenabap_runtime_frmwk_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). ABAP annotations can modify the behavior of ABAP SQL statements that access a [CDS entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). One important example is how the client-dependency of a CDS entity is defined using the associated ABAP annotation.
    
-   Framework-specific annotations
    
    In most cases, the [framework-specific annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenfrmwrk_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") must be evaluated by the frameworks of the corresponding software components using a suitable API and are not relevant for activations and the ABAP runtime framework. Here, the names and values of these framework-specific annotations must follow the rules of the relevant framework. For SAP components, these can be taken from the tables of the [Framework-Specific Annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_frmwrk.htm) document.
    

Annotations that are not evaluated by the ABAP runtime framework or by frameworks of other software components are usually ignored.

Description

This program uses a simple example to show how annotations can be evaluated in a framework. All rows in a CDS entity are to be found that do not contain a fully specified address. Here, a fully specified address is simply a set of elements for name, street, city, postal code, and country, none of which can be empty.

To do this, the program uses cl\_dd\_ddl\_annotation\_service=>get\_drct\_annos\_4\_entity\_elmnts to read the element annotations of a CDS entity and gets the names of the elements defined (using [semantics annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_frmwrk.htm)) as the required components of an address in the internal table address\_components. In the next step, the CDS entity is read using [SELECT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abapselect.htm) and a [dynamic](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abapassign_mem_area_dynamic_dobj.htm) [ASSIGN](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abapassign.htm) statement is used to check whether all required elements have a non-initial value for each read row. The output consists of any rows that do not contain a full address.

The following CDS view is used as an example for a CDS entity:

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_SEMANNO'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
define view demo\_cds\_semantics\_annotation
  as select from
    scustom
    {
      id,
      @Semantics.name.fullName
      name,
      @Semantics.name.prefix
      form,
      @Semantics.address.street
      street,
      @Semantics.address.postBox
      postbox,
      @Semantics.address.zipCode
      postcode,
      @Semantics.address.city
      city,
      @Semantics.address.country
      country,
      @Semantics.address.subRegion
      region,
      @Semantics.contact.type
      custtype,
      @Semantics.language
      langu,
      @Semantics.eMail.address
      email
    }

This view wraps the DDIC database table SCUSTOM, which contains address data. The assignment of the semantics annotations to the columns of the DDIC database table gives the columns semantics that can be evaluated. Previously, this was only provided by those names and [DDIC data elements](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abendata_element_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that are no longer relevant for the evaluation depicted here.

ABAP CDS - ABAP Annotation Syntax

The following tables summarize the [annotation syntax](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotation_syntax_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of all [ABAP annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenabap_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in [CDS DDL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_ddl_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and [CDS DCL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_dcl_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in ABAP CDS. Any specified subannotations are shown using [chainings](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_syntax_name.htm). If square brackets \[ \] are specified after a name in the column Annotation, this means that the annotation in front of the square brackets is an [annotation array](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenannotation_array_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). Any enumeration symbols in an annotation are specified in the column Enums. The column Default shows the default values applied to the evaluation when an annotation is specified without a value. The columns Text and MDE indicate whether the annotation values are translatable texts and whether the annotation can be specified in a [metadata extension](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_metadata_extension_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The API column indicates whether the annotation can be used in CDS entities defined in [ABAP for Cloud Development](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenabap_for_sap_cloud_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The detailed meanings of each ABAP annotation is documented for the corresponding [scope](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_scopes.htm) in this documentation.

Effect

Extends an existing [CDS DDIC-based view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_v1_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") ddic\_based\_view using a [CDS view extension](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_extend_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") cds\_view\_extension in the [CDS DDL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_ddl_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). An existing CDS DDIC-based view can have one or more CDS view extensions.

The extended CDS view ddic\_based\_view must be specified under the name of its [CDS entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The name of the [CDS-managed DDIC view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_mngdddic_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") cannot be specified.

Prerequisite

As a prerequisite for the enhancement of the CDS view with the statement EXTEND VIEW, the elements of the [annotation array](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenannotation_array_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory\[ \]](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_anno_v1.htm) must be specified accordingly in its definition with [DEFINE VIEW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_define_view_v1.htm):

-   By default or if only the value #PROJECTION\_LIST is specified, views without [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm) in the SELECT list and without a [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm) clause can be extended.
-   In order to extend views that have [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm) in the SELECT list, the annotation array must contain the value #GROUP\_BY alongside #PROJECTION\_LIST.
-   In order to extend views that contain [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm) clauses, the annotation array must contain the value #UNION alongside #PROJECTION\_LIST.
-   If the annotation array contains the value #NONE, the view cannot be extended.

Components of a view extension

View extensions can make additions to the original view, but it can't modify, overwrite, or delete elements from the original view. The following components are possible in a CDS view extension:

-   The annotation [AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm) is mandatory. Further annotations [extension\_annot1](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm), [extension\_annot2](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm), ... can also be specified. This is optional.
-   New associations association1, association2 can be defined and exposed in the CDS view extension. The same rules apply that are described in topic [CDS DDL - DDIC-based view, ASSOCIATION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_simple_association_v1.htm).
    
    Note: It is not allowed to define new [CDS compositions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_composition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or [CDS to-parent associations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abento_parent_association_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in a view extension.
    
-   The elements of the extension list select\_list\_extension specified after EXTEND VIEW are added to the existing SELECT list. At least one element must be added. It is possible to access all fields of all data sources of the extended view in the extension list select\_list\_extension. The list can have all [elements](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_entry_v1.htm) of a [SELECT list](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_v1.htm), namely:
    -   [field](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_field_v2.htm) of a data source
    -   [Input parameters](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_parameter_v1.htm) of the extended CDS view. It is not possible to specify new input parameters in a view extension.
    -   It can expose a [CDS association](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_association_v2.htm) of the extended view or a newly defined association
    -   Using a [path expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_path_expression_v1.htm), a field of an association target can be included. Path expressions are possible for associations of the extended view or for newly defined associations.
    -   [literals, session variables, expressions and functions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_operands_and_expr_v1.htm)
        
        Note: To add aggregate expressions to a view extension, special rules apply. See below.
        
-   Aggregate expressions are possible in the SELECT list of a view extension only if the following conditions are met:
    -   The original view must contain [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm). If the original view does not contain any aggregate expressions, this is not possible.
    -   The extended view must be annotated with AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory \[#PROJECTION\_LIST, #GROUP\_BY\]
    -   If non-aggregated elements are added to a CDS view with aggregate expressions, then the [GROUP-BY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_group_by_v1.htm) clause must be extended using the addition GROUP BY
-   If the original view contains [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm), equivalent UNION additions must be used in the statement EXTEND VIEW. As a prerequisite, the extended view must be annotated with AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory \[#PROJECTION\_LIST, #UNION\]
    
    If an appended element already occurs in the existing SELECT list or if a different extension occurs, it must be given an alternative element name using AS.
    

Restrictions

-   CDS views with an explicit [name list](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_name_list_v1.htm) cannot currently be extended.
-   CDS view extensions themselves cannot be extended.
-   It is not possible to specify new input parameters in a view extension.
-   No addition [ROOT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_define_root_view_v1.htm) can be specified in the statement EXTEND VIEW to transform a regular view to a [root entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenroot_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
-   An appended field cannot be defined as a key field using KEY.
-   It is not allowed to define new to-parent or composition associations in a view extension.
-   For views that have an element of data type LRAW or LCHR in the SELECT list, no view extension is possible and the annotation AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory\[#NONE\] is enforced. The reason is that elements of data types LRAW or LCHR must always be in the last position of the SELECT list.

Naming

Two repository objects are created for a CDS view extension that is defined using EXTEND VIEW. A name must be specified for each of the two objects:

-   The actual name cds\_view\_extension of the CDS view extension is specified after the keywords EXTEND VIEW. This name follows the same rules as the name of an [DDIC append view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_append_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), but can have up to 30 characters.
-   The name CDS\_APPEND\_VIEW for an [append view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_append_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in ABAP Dictionary must be specified in quotation marks after the annotation [@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm). This name is subject to the same rules as the name of a [DDIC database view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abendatabase_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in ABAP Dictionary, see topic [DDIC - Naming Rules for DDIC Views](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_view_names.htm). The new DDIC append view extends the [CDS-managed DDIC view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_mngdddic_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the extended CDS view. The name given to the DDIC append view can no longer be changed after the CDS view extension is transported into a follow-on system.

The name of the new DDIC append view and of the actual CDS view extension should be located in the customer namespace (or in the namespace of a partner or special development) to protect it against being overwritten by upgrades or new releases.

-   Once the DDL source code of a CDS view extension has been transported, the actual name cds\_view\_extension and the name of the DDIC append view CDS\_APPEND\_VIEW can no longer be changed. The extended view ddic\_based\_view can also no longer be changed.

Note: The DDL source code of a CDS view extension does not need to have the same name as the CDS view extension entity, but it is advisable to use the name of the entity.

Hints

-   Currently it is not possible to define extension categories for CDS views. The following restrictions apply for this reason:
    -   CDS views have the property can be extended in any way with respect to the [extension category of DDIC structures](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_structures_enh_cat.htm). The consequences of this must be respected when extending a CDS view.
    -   The attributes of a CDS view defined using [annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_anno_v1.htm), such as switching on [table buffering](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abentable_buffering_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), cannot currently be modified using extensions.
-   CDS view extensions specified with EXTEND ENTITY are recommended for CDS DDIC-based views only. However, for compatibility and migration reasons, it is also possible to extend [CDS projection views](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_projection_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or [CDS view entities](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_v2_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") with the statement EXTEND VIEW. However, view extends defined using EXTEND VIEW don't support the syntax elements specific to projection views and CDS view entities. Therefore, it is recommended to use the statement [EXTEND VIEW ENTITY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_extend_view_entity.htm) for extensions of CDS projection views and CDS view entities instead.
-   If, for some reason, a CDS projection view or a CDS view entity is extended with EXTEND VIEW, the [CDS-managed DDIC view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_mngdddic_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is deleted (as CDS projection views and CDS view entities do not have any DDIC artefacts), and entity annotations referring to the CDS-managed DDIC view are ignored.

Example

The following CDS view extension

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_EXTENS'
extend view demo\_cds\_original\_view with demo\_cds\_view\_extension  
  {
    spfli.distance,
    spfli.distid as unit
  };

adds two view fields to the existing CDS view

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_ORIG'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
@AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory: \[#PROJECTION\_LIST\]
@EndUserText.label: 'Further information about the CDS entity'
define view demo\_cds\_original\_view  
  as select from
           spfli
      join scarr on
        scarr.carrid = spfli.carrid
    {
      key scarr.carrname     as carrier,
      key spfli.connid       as flight,
          spfli.cityfrom     as departure,
          spfli.cityto       as destination
    }; .

The DDIC append view DEMO\_CDS\_EXTENS is created in ABAP Dictionary. The program DEMO\_CDS\_VIEW\_EXTENSION uses the statement [SELECT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abapselect.htm) to access the enhanced view and also displays the components of the dictionary structures in question.

Addition 1   

... GROUP BY field1, field2, ...

Effect

This addition must be specified if elements not defined using aggregate expressions are added to a view with [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm). These elements must be specified after GROUP BY add extend the [GROUP-BY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_group_by_v1.htm) clause of the original view. With respect to the extended view, the extended GROUP-BY clause must follow the general rules for a GROUP-BY clause.

The addition cannot be specified if the definition of the original view does not contain any aggregate expressions in its SELECT list.

Hint

Extensions of a view with aggregate expressions require it to contain the annotation array viewEnhancementCategory\[ \] with the value #GROUP\_BY.

Example

The following CDS view extension

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_EXTAGG'
extend view demo\_cds\_aggregate with demo\_cds\_extend\_aggregate
  {
    connid,  
    sum(distance) as sum\_distance
  }
  group by
    connid;

extends the existing CDS view

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_AGG'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
@AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory: \[#PROJECTION\_LIST,#GROUP\_BY\]
define view demo\_cds\_aggregate
  as select from
    spfli  
    {
      carrid,
      sum(fltime) as sum\_fltime
    }
    group by
      carrid; .

A database field connid and an aggregate expression sum(distance) are added to the SELECT list. Accordingly, the addition GROUP BY must be used to add the database field to the GROUP-BY clause of the original view.

Addition 2   

... UNION *\[*ALL*\]* { ... }

Effect

This addition must be specified when a view with [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm) clauses is extended. A corresponding UNION addition must be specified for each UNION clause of the original view. The addition ALL must be specified each time it is specified in the associated UNION clause of the original view. The curly brackets can contain elements that extend the SELECT list of the associated UNION clause of the original view. As specified by the SELECT list extended using select\_list\_extension, the UNION clauses must be extended so that the rules for UNION clauses are not broken in the extended view.

The addition cannot be specified if the definition of the original view does not have a UNION clause.

Hint

Extensions of a view with UNION clauses require it to contain the annotation array viewEnhancementCategory\[ \] with the value #UNION.

Example

The following CDS view extension

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_EXTUNI'
extend view demo\_cds\_union with demo\_cds\_extend\_union
  {
    c as c3,
    d as c4
  }
union
  {
    f as c3,
    g as c4
  }
union all
  {
    k as c3,
    l as c4
  };

extends the existing CDS view

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_UIO'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
@AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory: \[#PROJECTION\_LIST,#UNION\]
define view demo\_cds\_union
  as select from
    demo\_join1
    {
      a as c1,
      b as c2
    }
union select from
  demo\_join2
    {
      d as c1,
      e as c2
    }
union all select from
  demo\_join3
    {
      i as c1,
      j as c2
    }; .

The original view has two UNION clauses represented using corresponding UNION additions in the definition of the CDS view extension. Two elements with matching types are added to the three SELECT lists of the original view.

Syntax

... @[annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_syntax.htm) ...

Effect

Specifies an [annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_syntax.htm) as an extension annotation in the definition of a [CDS view extension](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_extend_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") before the statement [EXTEND VIEW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_extend_view.htm). The character @ must be placed in front of the name annotation of the annotation. The annotation should be defined as a CDS object in a [CDS annotation definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_anno_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and the annotation definition annotation [@Scope](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_anno_annos.htm) should be specified here using the value #EXTEND\_VIEW.

The following tables show the possible [ABAP annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenabap_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that can be specified and their meanings. The ABAP annotations are evaluated by the ABAP runtime framework for every CDS entity. Annotations with other identifiers are usually [framework-specific annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_frmwrk.htm). These are not evaluated by the ABAP runtime framework but by other SAP frameworks instead.

The first column of the table shows the (possibly structured) name annotation of an ABAP annotation and the second column shows its meaning. The third column shows the possible [annotation values](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenannotation_value_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The fourth column shows the default value which is used if the annotation is not used at all. The fifth column shows the default value set implicitly for value in accordance with the [annotation definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_anno_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") if the annotation is specified without a value. If nothing is specified for the annotation value, the annotation should be specified without a value.

Effect

Extends an existing [CDS DDIC-based view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_v1_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") ddic\_based\_view using a [CDS view extension](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_extend_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") cds\_view\_extension in the [CDS DDL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_ddl_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). An existing CDS DDIC-based view can have one or more CDS view extensions.

The extended CDS view ddic\_based\_view must be specified under the name of its [CDS entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The name of the [CDS-managed DDIC view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_mngdddic_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") cannot be specified.

Prerequisite

As a prerequisite for the enhancement of the CDS view with the statement EXTEND VIEW, the elements of the [annotation array](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenannotation_array_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory\[ \]](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_anno_v1.htm) must be specified accordingly in its definition with [DEFINE VIEW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_define_view_v1.htm):

-   By default or if only the value #PROJECTION\_LIST is specified, views without [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm) in the SELECT list and without a [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm) clause can be extended.
-   In order to extend views that have [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm) in the SELECT list, the annotation array must contain the value #GROUP\_BY alongside #PROJECTION\_LIST.
-   In order to extend views that contain [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm) clauses, the annotation array must contain the value #UNION alongside #PROJECTION\_LIST.
-   If the annotation array contains the value #NONE, the view cannot be extended.

Components of a view extension

View extensions can make additions to the original view, but it can't modify, overwrite, or delete elements from the original view. The following components are possible in a CDS view extension:

-   The annotation [AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm) is mandatory. Further annotations [extension\_annot1](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm), [extension\_annot2](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm), ... can also be specified. This is optional.
-   New associations association1, association2 can be defined and exposed in the CDS view extension. The same rules apply that are described in topic [CDS DDL - DDIC-based view, ASSOCIATION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_simple_association_v1.htm).
    
    Note: It is not allowed to define new [CDS compositions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_composition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or [CDS to-parent associations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abento_parent_association_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in a view extension.
    
-   The elements of the extension list select\_list\_extension specified after EXTEND VIEW are added to the existing SELECT list. At least one element must be added. It is possible to access all fields of all data sources of the extended view in the extension list select\_list\_extension. The list can have all [elements](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_entry_v1.htm) of a [SELECT list](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_v1.htm), namely:
    -   [field](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_field_v2.htm) of a data source
    -   [Input parameters](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_parameter_v1.htm) of the extended CDS view. It is not possible to specify new input parameters in a view extension.
    -   It can expose a [CDS association](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_association_v2.htm) of the extended view or a newly defined association
    -   Using a [path expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_path_expression_v1.htm), a field of an association target can be included. Path expressions are possible for associations of the extended view or for newly defined associations.
    -   [literals, session variables, expressions and functions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_operands_and_expr_v1.htm)
        
        Note: To add aggregate expressions to a view extension, special rules apply. See below.
        
-   Aggregate expressions are possible in the SELECT list of a view extension only if the following conditions are met:
    -   The original view must contain [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm). If the original view does not contain any aggregate expressions, this is not possible.
    -   The extended view must be annotated with AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory \[#PROJECTION\_LIST, #GROUP\_BY\]
    -   If non-aggregated elements are added to a CDS view with aggregate expressions, then the [GROUP-BY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_group_by_v1.htm) clause must be extended using the addition GROUP BY
-   If the original view contains [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm), equivalent UNION additions must be used in the statement EXTEND VIEW. As a prerequisite, the extended view must be annotated with AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory \[#PROJECTION\_LIST, #UNION\]
    
    If an appended element already occurs in the existing SELECT list or if a different extension occurs, it must be given an alternative element name using AS.
    

Restrictions

-   CDS views with an explicit [name list](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_name_list_v1.htm) cannot currently be extended.
-   CDS view extensions themselves cannot be extended.
-   It is not possible to specify new input parameters in a view extension.
-   No addition [ROOT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_define_root_view_v1.htm) can be specified in the statement EXTEND VIEW to transform a regular view to a [root entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenroot_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
-   An appended field cannot be defined as a key field using KEY.
-   It is not allowed to define new to-parent or composition associations in a view extension.
-   For views that have an element of data type LRAW or LCHR in the SELECT list, no view extension is possible and the annotation AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory\[#NONE\] is enforced. The reason is that elements of data types LRAW or LCHR must always be in the last position of the SELECT list.

Naming

Two repository objects are created for a CDS view extension that is defined using EXTEND VIEW. A name must be specified for each of the two objects:

-   The actual name cds\_view\_extension of the CDS view extension is specified after the keywords EXTEND VIEW. This name follows the same rules as the name of an [DDIC append view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_append_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), but can have up to 30 characters.
-   The name CDS\_APPEND\_VIEW for an [append view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_append_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in ABAP Dictionary must be specified in quotation marks after the annotation [@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm). This name is subject to the same rules as the name of a [DDIC database view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abendatabase_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in ABAP Dictionary, see topic [DDIC - Naming Rules for DDIC Views](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_view_names.htm). The new DDIC append view extends the [CDS-managed DDIC view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_mngdddic_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the extended CDS view. The name given to the DDIC append view can no longer be changed after the CDS view extension is transported into a follow-on system.

The name of the new DDIC append view and of the actual CDS view extension should be located in the customer namespace (or in the namespace of a partner or special development) to protect it against being overwritten by upgrades or new releases.

-   Once the DDL source code of a CDS view extension has been transported, the actual name cds\_view\_extension and the name of the DDIC append view CDS\_APPEND\_VIEW can no longer be changed. The extended view ddic\_based\_view can also no longer be changed.

Note: The DDL source code of a CDS view extension does not need to have the same name as the CDS view extension entity, but it is advisable to use the name of the entity.

Hints

-   Currently it is not possible to define extension categories for CDS views. The following restrictions apply for this reason:
    -   CDS views have the property can be extended in any way with respect to the [extension category of DDIC structures](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_structures_enh_cat.htm). The consequences of this must be respected when extending a CDS view.
    -   The attributes of a CDS view defined using [annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_anno_v1.htm), such as switching on [table buffering](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abentable_buffering_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), cannot currently be modified using extensions.
-   CDS view extensions specified with EXTEND ENTITY are recommended for CDS DDIC-based views only. However, for compatibility and migration reasons, it is also possible to extend [CDS projection views](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_projection_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or [CDS view entities](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_v2_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") with the statement EXTEND VIEW. However, view extends defined using EXTEND VIEW don't support the syntax elements specific to projection views and CDS view entities. Therefore, it is recommended to use the statement [EXTEND VIEW ENTITY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_extend_view_entity.htm) for extensions of CDS projection views and CDS view entities instead.
-   If, for some reason, a CDS projection view or a CDS view entity is extended with EXTEND VIEW, the [CDS-managed DDIC view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_mngdddic_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is deleted (as CDS projection views and CDS view entities do not have any DDIC artefacts), and entity annotations referring to the CDS-managed DDIC view are ignored.

Example

The following CDS view extension

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_EXTENS'
extend view demo\_cds\_original\_view with demo\_cds\_view\_extension  
  {
    spfli.distance,
    spfli.distid as unit
  };

adds two view fields to the existing CDS view

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_ORIG'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
@AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory: \[#PROJECTION\_LIST\]
@EndUserText.label: 'Further information about the CDS entity'
define view demo\_cds\_original\_view  
  as select from
           spfli
      join scarr on
        scarr.carrid = spfli.carrid
    {
      key scarr.carrname     as carrier,
      key spfli.connid       as flight,
          spfli.cityfrom     as departure,
          spfli.cityto       as destination
    }; .

The DDIC append view DEMO\_CDS\_EXTENS is created in ABAP Dictionary. The program DEMO\_CDS\_VIEW\_EXTENSION uses the statement [SELECT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abapselect.htm) to access the enhanced view and also displays the components of the dictionary structures in question.

Addition 1   

... GROUP BY field1, field2, ...

Effect

This addition must be specified if elements not defined using aggregate expressions are added to a view with [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm). These elements must be specified after GROUP BY add extend the [GROUP-BY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_group_by_v1.htm) clause of the original view. With respect to the extended view, the extended GROUP-BY clause must follow the general rules for a GROUP-BY clause.

The addition cannot be specified if the definition of the original view does not contain any aggregate expressions in its SELECT list.

Hint

Extensions of a view with aggregate expressions require it to contain the annotation array viewEnhancementCategory\[ \] with the value #GROUP\_BY.

Example

The following CDS view extension

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_EXTAGG'
extend view demo\_cds\_aggregate with demo\_cds\_extend\_aggregate
  {
    connid,  
    sum(distance) as sum\_distance
  }
  group by
    connid;

extends the existing CDS view

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_AGG'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
@AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory: \[#PROJECTION\_LIST,#GROUP\_BY\]
define view demo\_cds\_aggregate
  as select from
    spfli  
    {
      carrid,
      sum(fltime) as sum\_fltime
    }
    group by
      carrid; .

A database field connid and an aggregate expression sum(distance) are added to the SELECT list. Accordingly, the addition GROUP BY must be used to add the database field to the GROUP-BY clause of the original view.

Addition 2   

... UNION *\[*ALL*\]* { ... }

Effect

This addition must be specified when a view with [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm) clauses is extended. A corresponding UNION addition must be specified for each UNION clause of the original view. The addition ALL must be specified each time it is specified in the associated UNION clause of the original view. The curly brackets can contain elements that extend the SELECT list of the associated UNION clause of the original view. As specified by the SELECT list extended using select\_list\_extension, the UNION clauses must be extended so that the rules for UNION clauses are not broken in the extended view.

The addition cannot be specified if the definition of the original view does not have a UNION clause.

Hint

Extensions of a view with UNION clauses require it to contain the annotation array viewEnhancementCategory\[ \] with the value #UNION.

Example

The following CDS view extension

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_EXTUNI'
extend view demo\_cds\_union with demo\_cds\_extend\_union
  {
    c as c3,
    d as c4
  }
union
  {
    f as c3,
    g as c4
  }
union all
  {
    k as c3,
    l as c4
  };

extends the existing CDS view

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_UIO'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
@AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory: \[#PROJECTION\_LIST,#UNION\]
define view demo\_cds\_union
  as select from
    demo\_join1
    {
      a as c1,
      b as c2
    }
union select from
  demo\_join2
    {
      d as c1,
      e as c2
    }
union all select from
  demo\_join3
    {
      i as c1,
      j as c2
    }; .

The original view has two UNION clauses represented using corresponding UNION additions in the definition of the CDS view extension. Two elements with matching types are added to the three SELECT lists of the original view.

Syntax

... @[annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_syntax.htm) ...

Effect

Specifies an [annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_syntax.htm) as an extension annotation in the definition of a [CDS view extension](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_extend_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") before the statement [EXTEND VIEW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_extend_view.htm). The character @ must be placed in front of the name annotation of the annotation. The annotation should be defined as a CDS object in a [CDS annotation definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_anno_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and the annotation definition annotation [@Scope](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_anno_annos.htm) should be specified here using the value #EXTEND\_VIEW.

The following tables show the possible [ABAP annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenabap_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that can be specified and their meanings. The ABAP annotations are evaluated by the ABAP runtime framework for every CDS entity. Annotations with other identifiers are usually [framework-specific annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_frmwrk.htm). These are not evaluated by the ABAP runtime framework but by other SAP frameworks instead.

The first column of the table shows the (possibly structured) name annotation of an ABAP annotation and the second column shows its meaning. The third column shows the possible [annotation values](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenannotation_value_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The fourth column shows the default value which is used if the annotation is not used at all. The fifth column shows the default value set implicitly for value in accordance with the [annotation definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_anno_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") if the annotation is specified without a value. If nothing is specified for the annotation value, the annotation should be specified without a value.

Effect

Extends an existing [CDS DDIC-based view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_v1_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") ddic\_based\_view using a [CDS view extension](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_extend_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") cds\_view\_extension in the [CDS DDL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_ddl_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). An existing CDS DDIC-based view can have one or more CDS view extensions.

The extended CDS view ddic\_based\_view must be specified under the name of its [CDS entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The name of the [CDS-managed DDIC view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_mngdddic_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") cannot be specified.

Prerequisite

As a prerequisite for the enhancement of the CDS view with the statement EXTEND VIEW, the elements of the [annotation array](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenannotation_array_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory\[ \]](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_anno_v1.htm) must be specified accordingly in its definition with [DEFINE VIEW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_define_view_v1.htm):

-   By default or if only the value #PROJECTION\_LIST is specified, views without [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm) in the SELECT list and without a [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm) clause can be extended.
-   In order to extend views that have [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm) in the SELECT list, the annotation array must contain the value #GROUP\_BY alongside #PROJECTION\_LIST.
-   In order to extend views that contain [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm) clauses, the annotation array must contain the value #UNION alongside #PROJECTION\_LIST.
-   If the annotation array contains the value #NONE, the view cannot be extended.

Components of a view extension

View extensions can make additions to the original view, but it can't modify, overwrite, or delete elements from the original view. The following components are possible in a CDS view extension:

-   The annotation [AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm) is mandatory. Further annotations [extension\_annot1](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm), [extension\_annot2](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm), ... can also be specified. This is optional.
-   New associations association1, association2 can be defined and exposed in the CDS view extension. The same rules apply that are described in topic [CDS DDL - DDIC-based view, ASSOCIATION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_simple_association_v1.htm).
    
    Note: It is not allowed to define new [CDS compositions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_composition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or [CDS to-parent associations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abento_parent_association_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in a view extension.
    
-   The elements of the extension list select\_list\_extension specified after EXTEND VIEW are added to the existing SELECT list. At least one element must be added. It is possible to access all fields of all data sources of the extended view in the extension list select\_list\_extension. The list can have all [elements](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_entry_v1.htm) of a [SELECT list](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_v1.htm), namely:
    -   [field](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_field_v2.htm) of a data source
    -   [Input parameters](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_parameter_v1.htm) of the extended CDS view. It is not possible to specify new input parameters in a view extension.
    -   It can expose a [CDS association](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_association_v2.htm) of the extended view or a newly defined association
    -   Using a [path expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_path_expression_v1.htm), a field of an association target can be included. Path expressions are possible for associations of the extended view or for newly defined associations.
    -   [literals, session variables, expressions and functions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_operands_and_expr_v1.htm)
        
        Note: To add aggregate expressions to a view extension, special rules apply. See below.
        
-   Aggregate expressions are possible in the SELECT list of a view extension only if the following conditions are met:
    -   The original view must contain [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm). If the original view does not contain any aggregate expressions, this is not possible.
    -   The extended view must be annotated with AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory \[#PROJECTION\_LIST, #GROUP\_BY\]
    -   If non-aggregated elements are added to a CDS view with aggregate expressions, then the [GROUP-BY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_group_by_v1.htm) clause must be extended using the addition GROUP BY
-   If the original view contains [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm), equivalent UNION additions must be used in the statement EXTEND VIEW. As a prerequisite, the extended view must be annotated with AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory \[#PROJECTION\_LIST, #UNION\]
    
    If an appended element already occurs in the existing SELECT list or if a different extension occurs, it must be given an alternative element name using AS.
    

Restrictions

-   CDS views with an explicit [name list](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_name_list_v1.htm) cannot currently be extended.
-   CDS view extensions themselves cannot be extended.
-   It is not possible to specify new input parameters in a view extension.
-   No addition [ROOT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_define_root_view_v1.htm) can be specified in the statement EXTEND VIEW to transform a regular view to a [root entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenroot_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
-   An appended field cannot be defined as a key field using KEY.
-   It is not allowed to define new to-parent or composition associations in a view extension.
-   For views that have an element of data type LRAW or LCHR in the SELECT list, no view extension is possible and the annotation AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory\[#NONE\] is enforced. The reason is that elements of data types LRAW or LCHR must always be in the last position of the SELECT list.

Naming

Two repository objects are created for a CDS view extension that is defined using EXTEND VIEW. A name must be specified for each of the two objects:

-   The actual name cds\_view\_extension of the CDS view extension is specified after the keywords EXTEND VIEW. This name follows the same rules as the name of an [DDIC append view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_append_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), but can have up to 30 characters.
-   The name CDS\_APPEND\_VIEW for an [append view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_append_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in ABAP Dictionary must be specified in quotation marks after the annotation [@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm). This name is subject to the same rules as the name of a [DDIC database view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abendatabase_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in ABAP Dictionary, see topic [DDIC - Naming Rules for DDIC Views](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_view_names.htm). The new DDIC append view extends the [CDS-managed DDIC view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_mngdddic_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the extended CDS view. The name given to the DDIC append view can no longer be changed after the CDS view extension is transported into a follow-on system.

The name of the new DDIC append view and of the actual CDS view extension should be located in the customer namespace (or in the namespace of a partner or special development) to protect it against being overwritten by upgrades or new releases.

-   Once the DDL source code of a CDS view extension has been transported, the actual name cds\_view\_extension and the name of the DDIC append view CDS\_APPEND\_VIEW can no longer be changed. The extended view ddic\_based\_view can also no longer be changed.

Note: The DDL source code of a CDS view extension does not need to have the same name as the CDS view extension entity, but it is advisable to use the name of the entity.

Hints

-   Currently it is not possible to define extension categories for CDS views. The following restrictions apply for this reason:
    -   CDS views have the property can be extended in any way with respect to the [extension category of DDIC structures](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_structures_enh_cat.htm). The consequences of this must be respected when extending a CDS view.
    -   The attributes of a CDS view defined using [annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_anno_v1.htm), such as switching on [table buffering](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abentable_buffering_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), cannot currently be modified using extensions.
-   CDS view extensions specified with EXTEND ENTITY are recommended for CDS DDIC-based views only. However, for compatibility and migration reasons, it is also possible to extend [CDS projection views](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_projection_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or [CDS view entities](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_v2_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") with the statement EXTEND VIEW. However, view extends defined using EXTEND VIEW don't support the syntax elements specific to projection views and CDS view entities. Therefore, it is recommended to use the statement [EXTEND VIEW ENTITY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_extend_view_entity.htm) for extensions of CDS projection views and CDS view entities instead.
-   If, for some reason, a CDS projection view or a CDS view entity is extended with EXTEND VIEW, the [CDS-managed DDIC view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_mngdddic_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is deleted (as CDS projection views and CDS view entities do not have any DDIC artefacts), and entity annotations referring to the CDS-managed DDIC view are ignored.

Example

The following CDS view extension

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_EXTENS'
extend view demo\_cds\_original\_view with demo\_cds\_view\_extension  
  {
    spfli.distance,
    spfli.distid as unit
  };

adds two view fields to the existing CDS view

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_ORIG'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
@AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory: \[#PROJECTION\_LIST\]
@EndUserText.label: 'Further information about the CDS entity'
define view demo\_cds\_original\_view  
  as select from
           spfli
      join scarr on
        scarr.carrid = spfli.carrid
    {
      key scarr.carrname     as carrier,
      key spfli.connid       as flight,
          spfli.cityfrom     as departure,
          spfli.cityto       as destination
    }; .

The DDIC append view DEMO\_CDS\_EXTENS is created in ABAP Dictionary. The program DEMO\_CDS\_VIEW\_EXTENSION uses the statement [SELECT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abapselect.htm) to access the enhanced view and also displays the components of the dictionary structures in question.

Addition 1   

... GROUP BY field1, field2, ...

Effect

This addition must be specified if elements not defined using aggregate expressions are added to a view with [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm). These elements must be specified after GROUP BY add extend the [GROUP-BY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_group_by_v1.htm) clause of the original view. With respect to the extended view, the extended GROUP-BY clause must follow the general rules for a GROUP-BY clause.

The addition cannot be specified if the definition of the original view does not contain any aggregate expressions in its SELECT list.

Hint

Extensions of a view with aggregate expressions require it to contain the annotation array viewEnhancementCategory\[ \] with the value #GROUP\_BY.

Example

The following CDS view extension

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_EXTAGG'
extend view demo\_cds\_aggregate with demo\_cds\_extend\_aggregate
  {
    connid,  
    sum(distance) as sum\_distance
  }
  group by
    connid;

extends the existing CDS view

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_AGG'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
@AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory: \[#PROJECTION\_LIST,#GROUP\_BY\]
define view demo\_cds\_aggregate
  as select from
    spfli  
    {
      carrid,
      sum(fltime) as sum\_fltime
    }
    group by
      carrid; .

A database field connid and an aggregate expression sum(distance) are added to the SELECT list. Accordingly, the addition GROUP BY must be used to add the database field to the GROUP-BY clause of the original view.

Addition 2   

... UNION *\[*ALL*\]* { ... }

Effect

This addition must be specified when a view with [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm) clauses is extended. A corresponding UNION addition must be specified for each UNION clause of the original view. The addition ALL must be specified each time it is specified in the associated UNION clause of the original view. The curly brackets can contain elements that extend the SELECT list of the associated UNION clause of the original view. As specified by the SELECT list extended using select\_list\_extension, the UNION clauses must be extended so that the rules for UNION clauses are not broken in the extended view.

The addition cannot be specified if the definition of the original view does not have a UNION clause.

Hint

Extensions of a view with UNION clauses require it to contain the annotation array viewEnhancementCategory\[ \] with the value #UNION.

Example

The following CDS view extension

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_EXTUNI'
extend view demo\_cds\_union with demo\_cds\_extend\_union
  {
    c as c3,
    d as c4
  }
union
  {
    f as c3,
    g as c4
  }
union all
  {
    k as c3,
    l as c4
  };

extends the existing CDS view

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_UIO'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
@AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory: \[#PROJECTION\_LIST,#UNION\]
define view demo\_cds\_union
  as select from
    demo\_join1
    {
      a as c1,
      b as c2
    }
union select from
  demo\_join2
    {
      d as c1,
      e as c2
    }
union all select from
  demo\_join3
    {
      i as c1,
      j as c2
    }; .

The original view has two UNION clauses represented using corresponding UNION additions in the definition of the CDS view extension. Two elements with matching types are added to the three SELECT lists of the original view.

Syntax

... @[annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_syntax.htm) ...

Effect

Specifies an [annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_syntax.htm) as an extension annotation in the definition of a [CDS view extension](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_extend_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") before the statement [EXTEND VIEW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_extend_view.htm). The character @ must be placed in front of the name annotation of the annotation. The annotation should be defined as a CDS object in a [CDS annotation definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_anno_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and the annotation definition annotation [@Scope](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_anno_annos.htm) should be specified here using the value #EXTEND\_VIEW.

The following tables show the possible [ABAP annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenabap_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that can be specified and their meanings. The ABAP annotations are evaluated by the ABAP runtime framework for every CDS entity. Annotations with other identifiers are usually [framework-specific annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_frmwrk.htm). These are not evaluated by the ABAP runtime framework but by other SAP frameworks instead.

The first column of the table shows the (possibly structured) name annotation of an ABAP annotation and the second column shows its meaning. The third column shows the possible [annotation values](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenannotation_value_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The fourth column shows the default value which is used if the annotation is not used at all. The fifth column shows the default value set implicitly for value in accordance with the [annotation definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_anno_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") if the annotation is specified without a value. If nothing is specified for the annotation value, the annotation should be specified without a value.

-   Each definition of a CDS view extension must contain the ABAP annotation AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName that defines the name of the DDIC append view in ABAP Dictionary.
-   The name given to the DDIC append view can no longer be changed after the CDS view extension is transported into a follow-on system.

Effect

Extends an existing [CDS DDIC-based view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_v1_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") ddic\_based\_view using a [CDS view extension](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_extend_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") cds\_view\_extension in the [CDS DDL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_ddl_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). An existing CDS DDIC-based view can have one or more CDS view extensions.

The extended CDS view ddic\_based\_view must be specified under the name of its [CDS entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The name of the [CDS-managed DDIC view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_mngdddic_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") cannot be specified.

Prerequisite

As a prerequisite for the enhancement of the CDS view with the statement EXTEND VIEW, the elements of the [annotation array](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenannotation_array_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory\[ \]](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_anno_v1.htm) must be specified accordingly in its definition with [DEFINE VIEW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_define_view_v1.htm):

-   By default or if only the value #PROJECTION\_LIST is specified, views without [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm) in the SELECT list and without a [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm) clause can be extended.
-   In order to extend views that have [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm) in the SELECT list, the annotation array must contain the value #GROUP\_BY alongside #PROJECTION\_LIST.
-   In order to extend views that contain [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm) clauses, the annotation array must contain the value #UNION alongside #PROJECTION\_LIST.
-   If the annotation array contains the value #NONE, the view cannot be extended.

Components of a view extension

View extensions can make additions to the original view, but it can't modify, overwrite, or delete elements from the original view. The following components are possible in a CDS view extension:

-   The annotation [AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm) is mandatory. Further annotations [extension\_annot1](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm), [extension\_annot2](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm), ... can also be specified. This is optional.
-   New associations association1, association2 can be defined and exposed in the CDS view extension. The same rules apply that are described in topic [CDS DDL - DDIC-based view, ASSOCIATION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_simple_association_v1.htm).
    
    Note: It is not allowed to define new [CDS compositions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_composition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or [CDS to-parent associations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abento_parent_association_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in a view extension.
    
-   The elements of the extension list select\_list\_extension specified after EXTEND VIEW are added to the existing SELECT list. At least one element must be added. It is possible to access all fields of all data sources of the extended view in the extension list select\_list\_extension. The list can have all [elements](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_entry_v1.htm) of a [SELECT list](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_v1.htm), namely:
    -   [field](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_field_v2.htm) of a data source
    -   [Input parameters](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_parameter_v1.htm) of the extended CDS view. It is not possible to specify new input parameters in a view extension.
    -   It can expose a [CDS association](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_association_v2.htm) of the extended view or a newly defined association
    -   Using a [path expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_path_expression_v1.htm), a field of an association target can be included. Path expressions are possible for associations of the extended view or for newly defined associations.
    -   [literals, session variables, expressions and functions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_operands_and_expr_v1.htm)
        
        Note: To add aggregate expressions to a view extension, special rules apply. See below.
        
-   Aggregate expressions are possible in the SELECT list of a view extension only if the following conditions are met:
    -   The original view must contain [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm). If the original view does not contain any aggregate expressions, this is not possible.
    -   The extended view must be annotated with AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory \[#PROJECTION\_LIST, #GROUP\_BY\]
    -   If non-aggregated elements are added to a CDS view with aggregate expressions, then the [GROUP-BY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_group_by_v1.htm) clause must be extended using the addition GROUP BY
-   If the original view contains [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm), equivalent UNION additions must be used in the statement EXTEND VIEW. As a prerequisite, the extended view must be annotated with AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory \[#PROJECTION\_LIST, #UNION\]
    
    If an appended element already occurs in the existing SELECT list or if a different extension occurs, it must be given an alternative element name using AS.
    

Restrictions

-   CDS views with an explicit [name list](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_name_list_v1.htm) cannot currently be extended.
-   CDS view extensions themselves cannot be extended.
-   It is not possible to specify new input parameters in a view extension.
-   No addition [ROOT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_define_root_view_v1.htm) can be specified in the statement EXTEND VIEW to transform a regular view to a [root entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenroot_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
-   An appended field cannot be defined as a key field using KEY.
-   It is not allowed to define new to-parent or composition associations in a view extension.
-   For views that have an element of data type LRAW or LCHR in the SELECT list, no view extension is possible and the annotation AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory\[#NONE\] is enforced. The reason is that elements of data types LRAW or LCHR must always be in the last position of the SELECT list.

Naming

Two repository objects are created for a CDS view extension that is defined using EXTEND VIEW. A name must be specified for each of the two objects:

-   The actual name cds\_view\_extension of the CDS view extension is specified after the keywords EXTEND VIEW. This name follows the same rules as the name of an [DDIC append view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_append_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), but can have up to 30 characters.
-   The name CDS\_APPEND\_VIEW for an [append view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_append_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in ABAP Dictionary must be specified in quotation marks after the annotation [@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm). This name is subject to the same rules as the name of a [DDIC database view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abendatabase_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in ABAP Dictionary, see topic [DDIC - Naming Rules for DDIC Views](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_view_names.htm). The new DDIC append view extends the [CDS-managed DDIC view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_mngdddic_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the extended CDS view. The name given to the DDIC append view can no longer be changed after the CDS view extension is transported into a follow-on system.

The name of the new DDIC append view and of the actual CDS view extension should be located in the customer namespace (or in the namespace of a partner or special development) to protect it against being overwritten by upgrades or new releases.

-   Once the DDL source code of a CDS view extension has been transported, the actual name cds\_view\_extension and the name of the DDIC append view CDS\_APPEND\_VIEW can no longer be changed. The extended view ddic\_based\_view can also no longer be changed.

Note: The DDL source code of a CDS view extension does not need to have the same name as the CDS view extension entity, but it is advisable to use the name of the entity.

Hints

-   Currently it is not possible to define extension categories for CDS views. The following restrictions apply for this reason:
    -   CDS views have the property can be extended in any way with respect to the [extension category of DDIC structures](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_structures_enh_cat.htm). The consequences of this must be respected when extending a CDS view.
    -   The attributes of a CDS view defined using [annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_anno_v1.htm), such as switching on [table buffering](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abentable_buffering_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), cannot currently be modified using extensions.
-   CDS view extensions specified with EXTEND ENTITY are recommended for CDS DDIC-based views only. However, for compatibility and migration reasons, it is also possible to extend [CDS projection views](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_projection_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or [CDS view entities](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_v2_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") with the statement EXTEND VIEW. However, view extends defined using EXTEND VIEW don't support the syntax elements specific to projection views and CDS view entities. Therefore, it is recommended to use the statement [EXTEND VIEW ENTITY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_extend_view_entity.htm) for extensions of CDS projection views and CDS view entities instead.
-   If, for some reason, a CDS projection view or a CDS view entity is extended with EXTEND VIEW, the [CDS-managed DDIC view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_mngdddic_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is deleted (as CDS projection views and CDS view entities do not have any DDIC artefacts), and entity annotations referring to the CDS-managed DDIC view are ignored.

Example

The following CDS view extension

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_EXTENS'
extend view demo\_cds\_original\_view with demo\_cds\_view\_extension  
  {
    spfli.distance,
    spfli.distid as unit
  };

adds two view fields to the existing CDS view

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_ORIG'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
@AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory: \[#PROJECTION\_LIST\]
@EndUserText.label: 'Further information about the CDS entity'
define view demo\_cds\_original\_view  
  as select from
           spfli
      join scarr on
        scarr.carrid = spfli.carrid
    {
      key scarr.carrname     as carrier,
      key spfli.connid       as flight,
          spfli.cityfrom     as departure,
          spfli.cityto       as destination
    }; .

The DDIC append view DEMO\_CDS\_EXTENS is created in ABAP Dictionary. The program DEMO\_CDS\_VIEW\_EXTENSION uses the statement [SELECT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abapselect.htm) to access the enhanced view and also displays the components of the dictionary structures in question.

Addition 1   

... GROUP BY field1, field2, ...

Effect

This addition must be specified if elements not defined using aggregate expressions are added to a view with [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm). These elements must be specified after GROUP BY add extend the [GROUP-BY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_group_by_v1.htm) clause of the original view. With respect to the extended view, the extended GROUP-BY clause must follow the general rules for a GROUP-BY clause.

The addition cannot be specified if the definition of the original view does not contain any aggregate expressions in its SELECT list.

Hint

Extensions of a view with aggregate expressions require it to contain the annotation array viewEnhancementCategory\[ \] with the value #GROUP\_BY.

Example

The following CDS view extension

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_EXTAGG'
extend view demo\_cds\_aggregate with demo\_cds\_extend\_aggregate
  {
    connid,  
    sum(distance) as sum\_distance
  }
  group by
    connid;

extends the existing CDS view

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_AGG'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
@AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory: \[#PROJECTION\_LIST,#GROUP\_BY\]
define view demo\_cds\_aggregate
  as select from
    spfli  
    {
      carrid,
      sum(fltime) as sum\_fltime
    }
    group by
      carrid; .

A database field connid and an aggregate expression sum(distance) are added to the SELECT list. Accordingly, the addition GROUP BY must be used to add the database field to the GROUP-BY clause of the original view.

Addition 2   

... UNION *\[*ALL*\]* { ... }

Effect

This addition must be specified when a view with [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm) clauses is extended. A corresponding UNION addition must be specified for each UNION clause of the original view. The addition ALL must be specified each time it is specified in the associated UNION clause of the original view. The curly brackets can contain elements that extend the SELECT list of the associated UNION clause of the original view. As specified by the SELECT list extended using select\_list\_extension, the UNION clauses must be extended so that the rules for UNION clauses are not broken in the extended view.

The addition cannot be specified if the definition of the original view does not have a UNION clause.

Hint

Extensions of a view with UNION clauses require it to contain the annotation array viewEnhancementCategory\[ \] with the value #UNION.

Example

The following CDS view extension

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_EXTUNI'
extend view demo\_cds\_union with demo\_cds\_extend\_union
  {
    c as c3,
    d as c4
  }
union
  {
    f as c3,
    g as c4
  }
union all
  {
    k as c3,
    l as c4
  };

extends the existing CDS view

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_UIO'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
@AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory: \[#PROJECTION\_LIST,#UNION\]
define view demo\_cds\_union
  as select from
    demo\_join1
    {
      a as c1,
      b as c2
    }
union select from
  demo\_join2
    {
      d as c1,
      e as c2
    }
union all select from
  demo\_join3
    {
      i as c1,
      j as c2
    }; .

The original view has two UNION clauses represented using corresponding UNION additions in the definition of the CDS view extension. Two elements with matching types are added to the three SELECT lists of the original view.

Effect

Specifies an [annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_syntax.htm) as an extension annotation in the definition of a [CDS view extension](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_extend_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") before the statement [EXTEND VIEW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_extend_view.htm). The character @ must be placed in front of the name annotation of the annotation. The annotation should be defined as a CDS object in a [CDS annotation definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_anno_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and the annotation definition annotation [@Scope](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_anno_annos.htm) should be specified here using the value #EXTEND\_VIEW.

The following tables show the possible [ABAP annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenabap_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that can be specified and their meanings. The ABAP annotations are evaluated by the ABAP runtime framework for every CDS entity. Annotations with other identifiers are usually [framework-specific annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_frmwrk.htm). These are not evaluated by the ABAP runtime framework but by other SAP frameworks instead.

The first column of the table shows the (possibly structured) name annotation of an ABAP annotation and the second column shows its meaning. The third column shows the possible [annotation values](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenannotation_value_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The fourth column shows the default value which is used if the annotation is not used at all. The fifth column shows the default value set implicitly for value in accordance with the [annotation definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_anno_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") if the annotation is specified without a value. If nothing is specified for the annotation value, the annotation should be specified without a value.

Effect

Extends an existing [CDS DDIC-based view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_v1_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") ddic\_based\_view using a [CDS view extension](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_extend_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") cds\_view\_extension in the [CDS DDL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_ddl_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). An existing CDS DDIC-based view can have one or more CDS view extensions.

The extended CDS view ddic\_based\_view must be specified under the name of its [CDS entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The name of the [CDS-managed DDIC view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_mngdddic_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") cannot be specified.

Prerequisite

As a prerequisite for the enhancement of the CDS view with the statement EXTEND VIEW, the elements of the [annotation array](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenannotation_array_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory\[ \]](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_anno_v1.htm) must be specified accordingly in its definition with [DEFINE VIEW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_define_view_v1.htm):

-   By default or if only the value #PROJECTION\_LIST is specified, views without [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm) in the SELECT list and without a [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm) clause can be extended.
-   In order to extend views that have [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm) in the SELECT list, the annotation array must contain the value #GROUP\_BY alongside #PROJECTION\_LIST.
-   In order to extend views that contain [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm) clauses, the annotation array must contain the value #UNION alongside #PROJECTION\_LIST.
-   If the annotation array contains the value #NONE, the view cannot be extended.

Components of a view extension

View extensions can make additions to the original view, but it can't modify, overwrite, or delete elements from the original view. The following components are possible in a CDS view extension:

-   The annotation [AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm) is mandatory. Further annotations [extension\_annot1](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm), [extension\_annot2](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm), ... can also be specified. This is optional.
-   New associations association1, association2 can be defined and exposed in the CDS view extension. The same rules apply that are described in topic [CDS DDL - DDIC-based view, ASSOCIATION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_simple_association_v1.htm).
    
    Note: It is not allowed to define new [CDS compositions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_composition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or [CDS to-parent associations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abento_parent_association_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in a view extension.
    
-   The elements of the extension list select\_list\_extension specified after EXTEND VIEW are added to the existing SELECT list. At least one element must be added. It is possible to access all fields of all data sources of the extended view in the extension list select\_list\_extension. The list can have all [elements](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_entry_v1.htm) of a [SELECT list](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_v1.htm), namely:
    -   [field](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_field_v2.htm) of a data source
    -   [Input parameters](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_parameter_v1.htm) of the extended CDS view. It is not possible to specify new input parameters in a view extension.
    -   It can expose a [CDS association](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_association_v2.htm) of the extended view or a newly defined association
    -   Using a [path expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_path_expression_v1.htm), a field of an association target can be included. Path expressions are possible for associations of the extended view or for newly defined associations.
    -   [literals, session variables, expressions and functions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_operands_and_expr_v1.htm)
        
        Note: To add aggregate expressions to a view extension, special rules apply. See below.
        
-   Aggregate expressions are possible in the SELECT list of a view extension only if the following conditions are met:
    -   The original view must contain [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm). If the original view does not contain any aggregate expressions, this is not possible.
    -   The extended view must be annotated with AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory \[#PROJECTION\_LIST, #GROUP\_BY\]
    -   If non-aggregated elements are added to a CDS view with aggregate expressions, then the [GROUP-BY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_group_by_v1.htm) clause must be extended using the addition GROUP BY
-   If the original view contains [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm), equivalent UNION additions must be used in the statement EXTEND VIEW. As a prerequisite, the extended view must be annotated with AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory \[#PROJECTION\_LIST, #UNION\]
    
    If an appended element already occurs in the existing SELECT list or if a different extension occurs, it must be given an alternative element name using AS.
    

Restrictions

-   CDS views with an explicit [name list](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_name_list_v1.htm) cannot currently be extended.
-   CDS view extensions themselves cannot be extended.
-   It is not possible to specify new input parameters in a view extension.
-   No addition [ROOT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_define_root_view_v1.htm) can be specified in the statement EXTEND VIEW to transform a regular view to a [root entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenroot_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
-   An appended field cannot be defined as a key field using KEY.
-   It is not allowed to define new to-parent or composition associations in a view extension.
-   For views that have an element of data type LRAW or LCHR in the SELECT list, no view extension is possible and the annotation AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory\[#NONE\] is enforced. The reason is that elements of data types LRAW or LCHR must always be in the last position of the SELECT list.

Naming

Two repository objects are created for a CDS view extension that is defined using EXTEND VIEW. A name must be specified for each of the two objects:

-   The actual name cds\_view\_extension of the CDS view extension is specified after the keywords EXTEND VIEW. This name follows the same rules as the name of an [DDIC append view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_append_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), but can have up to 30 characters.
-   The name CDS\_APPEND\_VIEW for an [append view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_append_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in ABAP Dictionary must be specified in quotation marks after the annotation [@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm). This name is subject to the same rules as the name of a [DDIC database view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abendatabase_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in ABAP Dictionary, see topic [DDIC - Naming Rules for DDIC Views](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_view_names.htm). The new DDIC append view extends the [CDS-managed DDIC view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_mngdddic_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the extended CDS view. The name given to the DDIC append view can no longer be changed after the CDS view extension is transported into a follow-on system.

The name of the new DDIC append view and of the actual CDS view extension should be located in the customer namespace (or in the namespace of a partner or special development) to protect it against being overwritten by upgrades or new releases.

-   Once the DDL source code of a CDS view extension has been transported, the actual name cds\_view\_extension and the name of the DDIC append view CDS\_APPEND\_VIEW can no longer be changed. The extended view ddic\_based\_view can also no longer be changed.

Note: The DDL source code of a CDS view extension does not need to have the same name as the CDS view extension entity, but it is advisable to use the name of the entity.

Hints

-   Currently it is not possible to define extension categories for CDS views. The following restrictions apply for this reason:
    -   CDS views have the property can be extended in any way with respect to the [extension category of DDIC structures](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_structures_enh_cat.htm). The consequences of this must be respected when extending a CDS view.
    -   The attributes of a CDS view defined using [annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_anno_v1.htm), such as switching on [table buffering](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abentable_buffering_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), cannot currently be modified using extensions.
-   CDS view extensions specified with EXTEND ENTITY are recommended for CDS DDIC-based views only. However, for compatibility and migration reasons, it is also possible to extend [CDS projection views](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_projection_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or [CDS view entities](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_v2_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") with the statement EXTEND VIEW. However, view extends defined using EXTEND VIEW don't support the syntax elements specific to projection views and CDS view entities. Therefore, it is recommended to use the statement [EXTEND VIEW ENTITY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_extend_view_entity.htm) for extensions of CDS projection views and CDS view entities instead.
-   If, for some reason, a CDS projection view or a CDS view entity is extended with EXTEND VIEW, the [CDS-managed DDIC view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_mngdddic_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is deleted (as CDS projection views and CDS view entities do not have any DDIC artefacts), and entity annotations referring to the CDS-managed DDIC view are ignored.

Example

The following CDS view extension

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_EXTENS'
extend view demo\_cds\_original\_view with demo\_cds\_view\_extension  
  {
    spfli.distance,
    spfli.distid as unit
  };

adds two view fields to the existing CDS view

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_ORIG'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
@AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory: \[#PROJECTION\_LIST\]
@EndUserText.label: 'Further information about the CDS entity'
define view demo\_cds\_original\_view  
  as select from
           spfli
      join scarr on
        scarr.carrid = spfli.carrid
    {
      key scarr.carrname     as carrier,
      key spfli.connid       as flight,
          spfli.cityfrom     as departure,
          spfli.cityto       as destination
    }; .

The DDIC append view DEMO\_CDS\_EXTENS is created in ABAP Dictionary. The program DEMO\_CDS\_VIEW\_EXTENSION uses the statement [SELECT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abapselect.htm) to access the enhanced view and also displays the components of the dictionary structures in question.

Addition 1   

... GROUP BY field1, field2, ...

Effect

This addition must be specified if elements not defined using aggregate expressions are added to a view with [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm). These elements must be specified after GROUP BY add extend the [GROUP-BY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_group_by_v1.htm) clause of the original view. With respect to the extended view, the extended GROUP-BY clause must follow the general rules for a GROUP-BY clause.

The addition cannot be specified if the definition of the original view does not contain any aggregate expressions in its SELECT list.

Hint

Extensions of a view with aggregate expressions require it to contain the annotation array viewEnhancementCategory\[ \] with the value #GROUP\_BY.

Example

The following CDS view extension

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_EXTAGG'
extend view demo\_cds\_aggregate with demo\_cds\_extend\_aggregate
  {
    connid,  
    sum(distance) as sum\_distance
  }
  group by
    connid;

extends the existing CDS view

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_AGG'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
@AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory: \[#PROJECTION\_LIST,#GROUP\_BY\]
define view demo\_cds\_aggregate
  as select from
    spfli  
    {
      carrid,
      sum(fltime) as sum\_fltime
    }
    group by
      carrid; .

A database field connid and an aggregate expression sum(distance) are added to the SELECT list. Accordingly, the addition GROUP BY must be used to add the database field to the GROUP-BY clause of the original view.

Addition 2   

... UNION *\[*ALL*\]* { ... }

Effect

This addition must be specified when a view with [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm) clauses is extended. A corresponding UNION addition must be specified for each UNION clause of the original view. The addition ALL must be specified each time it is specified in the associated UNION clause of the original view. The curly brackets can contain elements that extend the SELECT list of the associated UNION clause of the original view. As specified by the SELECT list extended using select\_list\_extension, the UNION clauses must be extended so that the rules for UNION clauses are not broken in the extended view.

The addition cannot be specified if the definition of the original view does not have a UNION clause.

Hint

Extensions of a view with UNION clauses require it to contain the annotation array viewEnhancementCategory\[ \] with the value #UNION.

Example

The following CDS view extension

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_EXTUNI'
extend view demo\_cds\_union with demo\_cds\_extend\_union
  {
    c as c3,
    d as c4
  }
union
  {
    f as c3,
    g as c4
  }
union all
  {
    k as c3,
    l as c4
  };

extends the existing CDS view

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_UIO'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
@AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory: \[#PROJECTION\_LIST,#UNION\]
define view demo\_cds\_union
  as select from
    demo\_join1
    {
      a as c1,
      b as c2
    }
union select from
  demo\_join2
    {
      d as c1,
      e as c2
    }
union all select from
  demo\_join3
    {
      i as c1,
      j as c2
    }; .

The original view has two UNION clauses represented using corresponding UNION additions in the definition of the CDS view extension. Two elements with matching types are added to the three SELECT lists of the original view.

Effect

Specifies an [annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_syntax.htm) as an extension annotation in the definition of a [CDS view extension](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_extend_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") before the statement [EXTEND VIEW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_extend_view.htm). The character @ must be placed in front of the name annotation of the annotation. The annotation should be defined as a CDS object in a [CDS annotation definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_anno_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and the annotation definition annotation [@Scope](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_anno_annos.htm) should be specified here using the value #EXTEND\_VIEW.

The following tables show the possible [ABAP annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenabap_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that can be specified and their meanings. The ABAP annotations are evaluated by the ABAP runtime framework for every CDS entity. Annotations with other identifiers are usually [framework-specific annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_frmwrk.htm). These are not evaluated by the ABAP runtime framework but by other SAP frameworks instead.

The first column of the table shows the (possibly structured) name annotation of an ABAP annotation and the second column shows its meaning. The third column shows the possible [annotation values](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenannotation_value_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The fourth column shows the default value which is used if the annotation is not used at all. The fifth column shows the default value set implicitly for value in accordance with the [annotation definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_anno_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") if the annotation is specified without a value. If nothing is specified for the annotation value, the annotation should be specified without a value.

-   Each definition of a CDS view extension must contain the ABAP annotation AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName that defines the name of the DDIC append view in ABAP Dictionary.
-   The name given to the DDIC append view can no longer be changed after the CDS view extension is transported into a follow-on system.

Effect

Extends an existing [CDS DDIC-based view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_v1_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") ddic\_based\_view using a [CDS view extension](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_extend_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") cds\_view\_extension in the [CDS DDL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_ddl_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). An existing CDS DDIC-based view can have one or more CDS view extensions.

The extended CDS view ddic\_based\_view must be specified under the name of its [CDS entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The name of the [CDS-managed DDIC view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_mngdddic_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") cannot be specified.

Prerequisite

As a prerequisite for the enhancement of the CDS view with the statement EXTEND VIEW, the elements of the [annotation array](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenannotation_array_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory\[ \]](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_anno_v1.htm) must be specified accordingly in its definition with [DEFINE VIEW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_define_view_v1.htm):

-   By default or if only the value #PROJECTION\_LIST is specified, views without [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm) in the SELECT list and without a [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm) clause can be extended.
-   In order to extend views that have [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm) in the SELECT list, the annotation array must contain the value #GROUP\_BY alongside #PROJECTION\_LIST.
-   In order to extend views that contain [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm) clauses, the annotation array must contain the value #UNION alongside #PROJECTION\_LIST.
-   If the annotation array contains the value #NONE, the view cannot be extended.

Components of a view extension

View extensions can make additions to the original view, but it can't modify, overwrite, or delete elements from the original view. The following components are possible in a CDS view extension:

-   The annotation [AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm) is mandatory. Further annotations [extension\_annot1](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm), [extension\_annot2](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm), ... can also be specified. This is optional.
-   New associations association1, association2 can be defined and exposed in the CDS view extension. The same rules apply that are described in topic [CDS DDL - DDIC-based view, ASSOCIATION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_simple_association_v1.htm).
    
    Note: It is not allowed to define new [CDS compositions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_composition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or [CDS to-parent associations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abento_parent_association_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in a view extension.
    
-   The elements of the extension list select\_list\_extension specified after EXTEND VIEW are added to the existing SELECT list. At least one element must be added. It is possible to access all fields of all data sources of the extended view in the extension list select\_list\_extension. The list can have all [elements](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_entry_v1.htm) of a [SELECT list](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_v1.htm), namely:
    -   [field](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_field_v2.htm) of a data source
    -   [Input parameters](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_parameter_v1.htm) of the extended CDS view. It is not possible to specify new input parameters in a view extension.
    -   It can expose a [CDS association](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_association_v2.htm) of the extended view or a newly defined association
    -   Using a [path expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_path_expression_v1.htm), a field of an association target can be included. Path expressions are possible for associations of the extended view or for newly defined associations.
    -   [literals, session variables, expressions and functions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_operands_and_expr_v1.htm)
        
        Note: To add aggregate expressions to a view extension, special rules apply. See below.
        
-   Aggregate expressions are possible in the SELECT list of a view extension only if the following conditions are met:
    -   The original view must contain [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm). If the original view does not contain any aggregate expressions, this is not possible.
    -   The extended view must be annotated with AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory \[#PROJECTION\_LIST, #GROUP\_BY\]
    -   If non-aggregated elements are added to a CDS view with aggregate expressions, then the [GROUP-BY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_group_by_v1.htm) clause must be extended using the addition GROUP BY
-   If the original view contains [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm), equivalent UNION additions must be used in the statement EXTEND VIEW. As a prerequisite, the extended view must be annotated with AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory \[#PROJECTION\_LIST, #UNION\]
    
    If an appended element already occurs in the existing SELECT list or if a different extension occurs, it must be given an alternative element name using AS.
    

Restrictions

-   CDS views with an explicit [name list](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_name_list_v1.htm) cannot currently be extended.
-   CDS view extensions themselves cannot be extended.
-   It is not possible to specify new input parameters in a view extension.
-   No addition [ROOT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_define_root_view_v1.htm) can be specified in the statement EXTEND VIEW to transform a regular view to a [root entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenroot_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
-   An appended field cannot be defined as a key field using KEY.
-   It is not allowed to define new to-parent or composition associations in a view extension.
-   For views that have an element of data type LRAW or LCHR in the SELECT list, no view extension is possible and the annotation AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory\[#NONE\] is enforced. The reason is that elements of data types LRAW or LCHR must always be in the last position of the SELECT list.

Naming

Two repository objects are created for a CDS view extension that is defined using EXTEND VIEW. A name must be specified for each of the two objects:

-   The actual name cds\_view\_extension of the CDS view extension is specified after the keywords EXTEND VIEW. This name follows the same rules as the name of an [DDIC append view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_append_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), but can have up to 30 characters.
-   The name CDS\_APPEND\_VIEW for an [append view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_append_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in ABAP Dictionary must be specified in quotation marks after the annotation [@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm). This name is subject to the same rules as the name of a [DDIC database view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abendatabase_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in ABAP Dictionary, see topic [DDIC - Naming Rules for DDIC Views](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_view_names.htm). The new DDIC append view extends the [CDS-managed DDIC view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_mngdddic_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the extended CDS view. The name given to the DDIC append view can no longer be changed after the CDS view extension is transported into a follow-on system.

The name of the new DDIC append view and of the actual CDS view extension should be located in the customer namespace (or in the namespace of a partner or special development) to protect it against being overwritten by upgrades or new releases.

-   Once the DDL source code of a CDS view extension has been transported, the actual name cds\_view\_extension and the name of the DDIC append view CDS\_APPEND\_VIEW can no longer be changed. The extended view ddic\_based\_view can also no longer be changed.

Note: The DDL source code of a CDS view extension does not need to have the same name as the CDS view extension entity, but it is advisable to use the name of the entity.

Hints

-   Currently it is not possible to define extension categories for CDS views. The following restrictions apply for this reason:
    -   CDS views have the property can be extended in any way with respect to the [extension category of DDIC structures](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_structures_enh_cat.htm). The consequences of this must be respected when extending a CDS view.
    -   The attributes of a CDS view defined using [annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_anno_v1.htm), such as switching on [table buffering](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abentable_buffering_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), cannot currently be modified using extensions.
-   CDS view extensions specified with EXTEND ENTITY are recommended for CDS DDIC-based views only. However, for compatibility and migration reasons, it is also possible to extend [CDS projection views](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_projection_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or [CDS view entities](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_v2_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") with the statement EXTEND VIEW. However, view extends defined using EXTEND VIEW don't support the syntax elements specific to projection views and CDS view entities. Therefore, it is recommended to use the statement [EXTEND VIEW ENTITY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_extend_view_entity.htm) for extensions of CDS projection views and CDS view entities instead.
-   If, for some reason, a CDS projection view or a CDS view entity is extended with EXTEND VIEW, the [CDS-managed DDIC view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_mngdddic_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is deleted (as CDS projection views and CDS view entities do not have any DDIC artefacts), and entity annotations referring to the CDS-managed DDIC view are ignored.

Example

The following CDS view extension

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_EXTENS'
extend view demo\_cds\_original\_view with demo\_cds\_view\_extension  
  {
    spfli.distance,
    spfli.distid as unit
  };

adds two view fields to the existing CDS view

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_ORIG'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
@AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory: \[#PROJECTION\_LIST\]
@EndUserText.label: 'Further information about the CDS entity'
define view demo\_cds\_original\_view  
  as select from
           spfli
      join scarr on
        scarr.carrid = spfli.carrid
    {
      key scarr.carrname     as carrier,
      key spfli.connid       as flight,
          spfli.cityfrom     as departure,
          spfli.cityto       as destination
    }; .

The DDIC append view DEMO\_CDS\_EXTENS is created in ABAP Dictionary. The program DEMO\_CDS\_VIEW\_EXTENSION uses the statement [SELECT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abapselect.htm) to access the enhanced view and also displays the components of the dictionary structures in question.

Addition 1   

... GROUP BY field1, field2, ...

Effect

This addition must be specified if elements not defined using aggregate expressions are added to a view with [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm). These elements must be specified after GROUP BY add extend the [GROUP-BY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_group_by_v1.htm) clause of the original view. With respect to the extended view, the extended GROUP-BY clause must follow the general rules for a GROUP-BY clause.

The addition cannot be specified if the definition of the original view does not contain any aggregate expressions in its SELECT list.

Hint

Extensions of a view with aggregate expressions require it to contain the annotation array viewEnhancementCategory\[ \] with the value #GROUP\_BY.

Example

The following CDS view extension

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_EXTAGG'
extend view demo\_cds\_aggregate with demo\_cds\_extend\_aggregate
  {
    connid,  
    sum(distance) as sum\_distance
  }
  group by
    connid;

extends the existing CDS view

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_AGG'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
@AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory: \[#PROJECTION\_LIST,#GROUP\_BY\]
define view demo\_cds\_aggregate
  as select from
    spfli  
    {
      carrid,
      sum(fltime) as sum\_fltime
    }
    group by
      carrid; .

A database field connid and an aggregate expression sum(distance) are added to the SELECT list. Accordingly, the addition GROUP BY must be used to add the database field to the GROUP-BY clause of the original view.

Addition 2   

... UNION *\[*ALL*\]* { ... }

Effect

This addition must be specified when a view with [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm) clauses is extended. A corresponding UNION addition must be specified for each UNION clause of the original view. The addition ALL must be specified each time it is specified in the associated UNION clause of the original view. The curly brackets can contain elements that extend the SELECT list of the associated UNION clause of the original view. As specified by the SELECT list extended using select\_list\_extension, the UNION clauses must be extended so that the rules for UNION clauses are not broken in the extended view.

The addition cannot be specified if the definition of the original view does not have a UNION clause.

Hint

Extensions of a view with UNION clauses require it to contain the annotation array viewEnhancementCategory\[ \] with the value #UNION.

Example

The following CDS view extension

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_EXTUNI'
extend view demo\_cds\_union with demo\_cds\_extend\_union
  {
    c as c3,
    d as c4
  }
union
  {
    f as c3,
    g as c4
  }
union all
  {
    k as c3,
    l as c4
  };

extends the existing CDS view

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_UIO'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
@AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory: \[#PROJECTION\_LIST,#UNION\]
define view demo\_cds\_union
  as select from
    demo\_join1
    {
      a as c1,
      b as c2
    }
union select from
  demo\_join2
    {
      d as c1,
      e as c2
    }
union all select from
  demo\_join3
    {
      i as c1,
      j as c2
    }; .

The original view has two UNION clauses represented using corresponding UNION additions in the definition of the CDS view extension. Two elements with matching types are added to the three SELECT lists of the original view.

Effect

Specifies an [annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_syntax.htm) as an extension annotation in the definition of a [CDS view extension](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_extend_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") before the statement [EXTEND VIEW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_extend_view.htm). The character @ must be placed in front of the name annotation of the annotation. The annotation should be defined as a CDS object in a [CDS annotation definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_anno_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and the annotation definition annotation [@Scope](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_anno_annos.htm) should be specified here using the value #EXTEND\_VIEW.

The following tables show the possible [ABAP annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenabap_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that can be specified and their meanings. The ABAP annotations are evaluated by the ABAP runtime framework for every CDS entity. Annotations with other identifiers are usually [framework-specific annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_frmwrk.htm). These are not evaluated by the ABAP runtime framework but by other SAP frameworks instead.

The first column of the table shows the (possibly structured) name annotation of an ABAP annotation and the second column shows its meaning. The third column shows the possible [annotation values](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenannotation_value_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The fourth column shows the default value which is used if the annotation is not used at all. The fifth column shows the default value set implicitly for value in accordance with the [annotation definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_anno_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") if the annotation is specified without a value. If nothing is specified for the annotation value, the annotation should be specified without a value.

Effect

Extends an existing [CDS DDIC-based view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_v1_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") ddic\_based\_view using a [CDS view extension](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_extend_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") cds\_view\_extension in the [CDS DDL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_ddl_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). An existing CDS DDIC-based view can have one or more CDS view extensions.

The extended CDS view ddic\_based\_view must be specified under the name of its [CDS entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The name of the [CDS-managed DDIC view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_mngdddic_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") cannot be specified.

Prerequisite

As a prerequisite for the enhancement of the CDS view with the statement EXTEND VIEW, the elements of the [annotation array](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenannotation_array_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory\[ \]](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_anno_v1.htm) must be specified accordingly in its definition with [DEFINE VIEW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_define_view_v1.htm):

-   By default or if only the value #PROJECTION\_LIST is specified, views without [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm) in the SELECT list and without a [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm) clause can be extended.
-   In order to extend views that have [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm) in the SELECT list, the annotation array must contain the value #GROUP\_BY alongside #PROJECTION\_LIST.
-   In order to extend views that contain [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm) clauses, the annotation array must contain the value #UNION alongside #PROJECTION\_LIST.
-   If the annotation array contains the value #NONE, the view cannot be extended.

Components of a view extension

View extensions can make additions to the original view, but it can't modify, overwrite, or delete elements from the original view. The following components are possible in a CDS view extension:

-   The annotation [AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm) is mandatory. Further annotations [extension\_annot1](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm), [extension\_annot2](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm), ... can also be specified. This is optional.
-   New associations association1, association2 can be defined and exposed in the CDS view extension. The same rules apply that are described in topic [CDS DDL - DDIC-based view, ASSOCIATION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_simple_association_v1.htm).
    
    Note: It is not allowed to define new [CDS compositions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_composition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or [CDS to-parent associations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abento_parent_association_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in a view extension.
    
-   The elements of the extension list select\_list\_extension specified after EXTEND VIEW are added to the existing SELECT list. At least one element must be added. It is possible to access all fields of all data sources of the extended view in the extension list select\_list\_extension. The list can have all [elements](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_entry_v1.htm) of a [SELECT list](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_v1.htm), namely:
    -   [field](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_field_v2.htm) of a data source
    -   [Input parameters](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_parameter_v1.htm) of the extended CDS view. It is not possible to specify new input parameters in a view extension.
    -   It can expose a [CDS association](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_association_v2.htm) of the extended view or a newly defined association
    -   Using a [path expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_path_expression_v1.htm), a field of an association target can be included. Path expressions are possible for associations of the extended view or for newly defined associations.
    -   [literals, session variables, expressions and functions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_operands_and_expr_v1.htm)
        
        Note: To add aggregate expressions to a view extension, special rules apply. See below.
        
-   Aggregate expressions are possible in the SELECT list of a view extension only if the following conditions are met:
    -   The original view must contain [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm). If the original view does not contain any aggregate expressions, this is not possible.
    -   The extended view must be annotated with AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory \[#PROJECTION\_LIST, #GROUP\_BY\]
    -   If non-aggregated elements are added to a CDS view with aggregate expressions, then the [GROUP-BY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_group_by_v1.htm) clause must be extended using the addition GROUP BY
-   If the original view contains [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm), equivalent UNION additions must be used in the statement EXTEND VIEW. As a prerequisite, the extended view must be annotated with AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory \[#PROJECTION\_LIST, #UNION\]
    
    If an appended element already occurs in the existing SELECT list or if a different extension occurs, it must be given an alternative element name using AS.
    

Restrictions

-   CDS views with an explicit [name list](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_name_list_v1.htm) cannot currently be extended.
-   CDS view extensions themselves cannot be extended.
-   It is not possible to specify new input parameters in a view extension.
-   No addition [ROOT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_define_root_view_v1.htm) can be specified in the statement EXTEND VIEW to transform a regular view to a [root entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenroot_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
-   An appended field cannot be defined as a key field using KEY.
-   It is not allowed to define new to-parent or composition associations in a view extension.
-   For views that have an element of data type LRAW or LCHR in the SELECT list, no view extension is possible and the annotation AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory\[#NONE\] is enforced. The reason is that elements of data types LRAW or LCHR must always be in the last position of the SELECT list.

Naming

Two repository objects are created for a CDS view extension that is defined using EXTEND VIEW. A name must be specified for each of the two objects:

-   The actual name cds\_view\_extension of the CDS view extension is specified after the keywords EXTEND VIEW. This name follows the same rules as the name of an [DDIC append view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_append_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), but can have up to 30 characters.
-   The name CDS\_APPEND\_VIEW for an [append view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_append_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in ABAP Dictionary must be specified in quotation marks after the annotation [@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm). This name is subject to the same rules as the name of a [DDIC database view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abendatabase_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in ABAP Dictionary, see topic [DDIC - Naming Rules for DDIC Views](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_view_names.htm). The new DDIC append view extends the [CDS-managed DDIC view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_mngdddic_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the extended CDS view. The name given to the DDIC append view can no longer be changed after the CDS view extension is transported into a follow-on system.

The name of the new DDIC append view and of the actual CDS view extension should be located in the customer namespace (or in the namespace of a partner or special development) to protect it against being overwritten by upgrades or new releases.

-   Once the DDL source code of a CDS view extension has been transported, the actual name cds\_view\_extension and the name of the DDIC append view CDS\_APPEND\_VIEW can no longer be changed. The extended view ddic\_based\_view can also no longer be changed.

Note: The DDL source code of a CDS view extension does not need to have the same name as the CDS view extension entity, but it is advisable to use the name of the entity.

Hints

-   Currently it is not possible to define extension categories for CDS views. The following restrictions apply for this reason:
    -   CDS views have the property can be extended in any way with respect to the [extension category of DDIC structures](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_structures_enh_cat.htm). The consequences of this must be respected when extending a CDS view.
    -   The attributes of a CDS view defined using [annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_anno_v1.htm), such as switching on [table buffering](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abentable_buffering_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), cannot currently be modified using extensions.
-   CDS view extensions specified with EXTEND ENTITY are recommended for CDS DDIC-based views only. However, for compatibility and migration reasons, it is also possible to extend [CDS projection views](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_projection_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or [CDS view entities](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_v2_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") with the statement EXTEND VIEW. However, view extends defined using EXTEND VIEW don't support the syntax elements specific to projection views and CDS view entities. Therefore, it is recommended to use the statement [EXTEND VIEW ENTITY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_extend_view_entity.htm) for extensions of CDS projection views and CDS view entities instead.
-   If, for some reason, a CDS projection view or a CDS view entity is extended with EXTEND VIEW, the [CDS-managed DDIC view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_mngdddic_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is deleted (as CDS projection views and CDS view entities do not have any DDIC artefacts), and entity annotations referring to the CDS-managed DDIC view are ignored.

Example

The following CDS view extension

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_EXTENS'
extend view demo\_cds\_original\_view with demo\_cds\_view\_extension  
  {
    spfli.distance,
    spfli.distid as unit
  };

adds two view fields to the existing CDS view

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_ORIG'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
@AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory: \[#PROJECTION\_LIST\]
@EndUserText.label: 'Further information about the CDS entity'
define view demo\_cds\_original\_view  
  as select from
           spfli
      join scarr on
        scarr.carrid = spfli.carrid
    {
      key scarr.carrname     as carrier,
      key spfli.connid       as flight,
          spfli.cityfrom     as departure,
          spfli.cityto       as destination
    }; .

The DDIC append view DEMO\_CDS\_EXTENS is created in ABAP Dictionary. The program DEMO\_CDS\_VIEW\_EXTENSION uses the statement [SELECT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abapselect.htm) to access the enhanced view and also displays the components of the dictionary structures in question.

Addition 1   

... GROUP BY field1, field2, ...

Effect

This addition must be specified if elements not defined using aggregate expressions are added to a view with [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm). These elements must be specified after GROUP BY add extend the [GROUP-BY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_group_by_v1.htm) clause of the original view. With respect to the extended view, the extended GROUP-BY clause must follow the general rules for a GROUP-BY clause.

The addition cannot be specified if the definition of the original view does not contain any aggregate expressions in its SELECT list.

Hint

Extensions of a view with aggregate expressions require it to contain the annotation array viewEnhancementCategory\[ \] with the value #GROUP\_BY.

Example

The following CDS view extension

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_EXTAGG'
extend view demo\_cds\_aggregate with demo\_cds\_extend\_aggregate
  {
    connid,  
    sum(distance) as sum\_distance
  }
  group by
    connid;

extends the existing CDS view

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_AGG'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
@AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory: \[#PROJECTION\_LIST,#GROUP\_BY\]
define view demo\_cds\_aggregate
  as select from
    spfli  
    {
      carrid,
      sum(fltime) as sum\_fltime
    }
    group by
      carrid; .

A database field connid and an aggregate expression sum(distance) are added to the SELECT list. Accordingly, the addition GROUP BY must be used to add the database field to the GROUP-BY clause of the original view.

Addition 2   

... UNION *\[*ALL*\]* { ... }

Effect

This addition must be specified when a view with [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm) clauses is extended. A corresponding UNION addition must be specified for each UNION clause of the original view. The addition ALL must be specified each time it is specified in the associated UNION clause of the original view. The curly brackets can contain elements that extend the SELECT list of the associated UNION clause of the original view. As specified by the SELECT list extended using select\_list\_extension, the UNION clauses must be extended so that the rules for UNION clauses are not broken in the extended view.

The addition cannot be specified if the definition of the original view does not have a UNION clause.

Hint

Extensions of a view with UNION clauses require it to contain the annotation array viewEnhancementCategory\[ \] with the value #UNION.

Example

The following CDS view extension

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_EXTUNI'
extend view demo\_cds\_union with demo\_cds\_extend\_union
  {
    c as c3,
    d as c4
  }
union
  {
    f as c3,
    g as c4
  }
union all
  {
    k as c3,
    l as c4
  };

extends the existing CDS view

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_UIO'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
@AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory: \[#PROJECTION\_LIST,#UNION\]
define view demo\_cds\_union
  as select from
    demo\_join1
    {
      a as c1,
      b as c2
    }
union select from
  demo\_join2
    {
      d as c1,
      e as c2
    }
union all select from
  demo\_join3
    {
      i as c1,
      j as c2
    }; .

The original view has two UNION clauses represented using corresponding UNION additions in the definition of the CDS view extension. Two elements with matching types are added to the three SELECT lists of the original view.

Effect

Specifies an [annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_syntax.htm) as an extension annotation in the definition of a [CDS view extension](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_extend_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") before the statement [EXTEND VIEW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_extend_view.htm). The character @ must be placed in front of the name annotation of the annotation. The annotation should be defined as a CDS object in a [CDS annotation definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_anno_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and the annotation definition annotation [@Scope](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_anno_annos.htm) should be specified here using the value #EXTEND\_VIEW.

The following tables show the possible [ABAP annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenabap_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that can be specified and their meanings. The ABAP annotations are evaluated by the ABAP runtime framework for every CDS entity. Annotations with other identifiers are usually [framework-specific annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_frmwrk.htm). These are not evaluated by the ABAP runtime framework but by other SAP frameworks instead.

The first column of the table shows the (possibly structured) name annotation of an ABAP annotation and the second column shows its meaning. The third column shows the possible [annotation values](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenannotation_value_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The fourth column shows the default value which is used if the annotation is not used at all. The fifth column shows the default value set implicitly for value in accordance with the [annotation definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_anno_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") if the annotation is specified without a value. If nothing is specified for the annotation value, the annotation should be specified without a value.

Effect

Extends an existing [CDS DDIC-based view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_v1_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") ddic\_based\_view using a [CDS view extension](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_extend_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") cds\_view\_extension in the [CDS DDL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_ddl_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). An existing CDS DDIC-based view can have one or more CDS view extensions.

The extended CDS view ddic\_based\_view must be specified under the name of its [CDS entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The name of the [CDS-managed DDIC view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_mngdddic_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") cannot be specified.

Prerequisite

As a prerequisite for the enhancement of the CDS view with the statement EXTEND VIEW, the elements of the [annotation array](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenannotation_array_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory\[ \]](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_anno_v1.htm) must be specified accordingly in its definition with [DEFINE VIEW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_define_view_v1.htm):

-   By default or if only the value #PROJECTION\_LIST is specified, views without [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm) in the SELECT list and without a [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm) clause can be extended.
-   In order to extend views that have [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm) in the SELECT list, the annotation array must contain the value #GROUP\_BY alongside #PROJECTION\_LIST.
-   In order to extend views that contain [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm) clauses, the annotation array must contain the value #UNION alongside #PROJECTION\_LIST.
-   If the annotation array contains the value #NONE, the view cannot be extended.

Components of a view extension

View extensions can make additions to the original view, but it can't modify, overwrite, or delete elements from the original view. The following components are possible in a CDS view extension:

-   The annotation [AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm) is mandatory. Further annotations [extension\_annot1](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm), [extension\_annot2](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm), ... can also be specified. This is optional.
-   New associations association1, association2 can be defined and exposed in the CDS view extension. The same rules apply that are described in topic [CDS DDL - DDIC-based view, ASSOCIATION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_simple_association_v1.htm).
    
    Note: It is not allowed to define new [CDS compositions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_composition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or [CDS to-parent associations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abento_parent_association_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in a view extension.
    
-   The elements of the extension list select\_list\_extension specified after EXTEND VIEW are added to the existing SELECT list. At least one element must be added. It is possible to access all fields of all data sources of the extended view in the extension list select\_list\_extension. The list can have all [elements](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_entry_v1.htm) of a [SELECT list](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_v1.htm), namely:
    -   [field](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_field_v2.htm) of a data source
    -   [Input parameters](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_parameter_v1.htm) of the extended CDS view. It is not possible to specify new input parameters in a view extension.
    -   It can expose a [CDS association](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_association_v2.htm) of the extended view or a newly defined association
    -   Using a [path expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_path_expression_v1.htm), a field of an association target can be included. Path expressions are possible for associations of the extended view or for newly defined associations.
    -   [literals, session variables, expressions and functions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_operands_and_expr_v1.htm)
        
        Note: To add aggregate expressions to a view extension, special rules apply. See below.
        
-   Aggregate expressions are possible in the SELECT list of a view extension only if the following conditions are met:
    -   The original view must contain [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm). If the original view does not contain any aggregate expressions, this is not possible.
    -   The extended view must be annotated with AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory \[#PROJECTION\_LIST, #GROUP\_BY\]
    -   If non-aggregated elements are added to a CDS view with aggregate expressions, then the [GROUP-BY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_group_by_v1.htm) clause must be extended using the addition GROUP BY
-   If the original view contains [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm), equivalent UNION additions must be used in the statement EXTEND VIEW. As a prerequisite, the extended view must be annotated with AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory \[#PROJECTION\_LIST, #UNION\]
    
    If an appended element already occurs in the existing SELECT list or if a different extension occurs, it must be given an alternative element name using AS.
    

Restrictions

-   CDS views with an explicit [name list](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_name_list_v1.htm) cannot currently be extended.
-   CDS view extensions themselves cannot be extended.
-   It is not possible to specify new input parameters in a view extension.
-   No addition [ROOT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_define_root_view_v1.htm) can be specified in the statement EXTEND VIEW to transform a regular view to a [root entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenroot_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
-   An appended field cannot be defined as a key field using KEY.
-   It is not allowed to define new to-parent or composition associations in a view extension.
-   For views that have an element of data type LRAW or LCHR in the SELECT list, no view extension is possible and the annotation AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory\[#NONE\] is enforced. The reason is that elements of data types LRAW or LCHR must always be in the last position of the SELECT list.

Naming

Two repository objects are created for a CDS view extension that is defined using EXTEND VIEW. A name must be specified for each of the two objects:

-   The actual name cds\_view\_extension of the CDS view extension is specified after the keywords EXTEND VIEW. This name follows the same rules as the name of an [DDIC append view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_append_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), but can have up to 30 characters.
-   The name CDS\_APPEND\_VIEW for an [append view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_append_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in ABAP Dictionary must be specified in quotation marks after the annotation [@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm). This name is subject to the same rules as the name of a [DDIC database view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abendatabase_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in ABAP Dictionary, see topic [DDIC - Naming Rules for DDIC Views](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_view_names.htm). The new DDIC append view extends the [CDS-managed DDIC view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_mngdddic_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the extended CDS view. The name given to the DDIC append view can no longer be changed after the CDS view extension is transported into a follow-on system.

The name of the new DDIC append view and of the actual CDS view extension should be located in the customer namespace (or in the namespace of a partner or special development) to protect it against being overwritten by upgrades or new releases.

-   Once the DDL source code of a CDS view extension has been transported, the actual name cds\_view\_extension and the name of the DDIC append view CDS\_APPEND\_VIEW can no longer be changed. The extended view ddic\_based\_view can also no longer be changed.

Note: The DDL source code of a CDS view extension does not need to have the same name as the CDS view extension entity, but it is advisable to use the name of the entity.

Hints

-   Currently it is not possible to define extension categories for CDS views. The following restrictions apply for this reason:
    -   CDS views have the property can be extended in any way with respect to the [extension category of DDIC structures](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_structures_enh_cat.htm). The consequences of this must be respected when extending a CDS view.
    -   The attributes of a CDS view defined using [annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_anno_v1.htm), such as switching on [table buffering](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abentable_buffering_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), cannot currently be modified using extensions.
-   CDS view extensions specified with EXTEND ENTITY are recommended for CDS DDIC-based views only. However, for compatibility and migration reasons, it is also possible to extend [CDS projection views](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_projection_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or [CDS view entities](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_v2_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") with the statement EXTEND VIEW. However, view extends defined using EXTEND VIEW don't support the syntax elements specific to projection views and CDS view entities. Therefore, it is recommended to use the statement [EXTEND VIEW ENTITY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_extend_view_entity.htm) for extensions of CDS projection views and CDS view entities instead.
-   If, for some reason, a CDS projection view or a CDS view entity is extended with EXTEND VIEW, the [CDS-managed DDIC view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_mngdddic_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is deleted (as CDS projection views and CDS view entities do not have any DDIC artefacts), and entity annotations referring to the CDS-managed DDIC view are ignored.

Example

The following CDS view extension

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_EXTENS'
extend view demo\_cds\_original\_view with demo\_cds\_view\_extension  
  {
    spfli.distance,
    spfli.distid as unit
  };

adds two view fields to the existing CDS view

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_ORIG'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
@AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory: \[#PROJECTION\_LIST\]
@EndUserText.label: 'Further information about the CDS entity'
define view demo\_cds\_original\_view  
  as select from
           spfli
      join scarr on
        scarr.carrid = spfli.carrid
    {
      key scarr.carrname     as carrier,
      key spfli.connid       as flight,
          spfli.cityfrom     as departure,
          spfli.cityto       as destination
    }; .

The DDIC append view DEMO\_CDS\_EXTENS is created in ABAP Dictionary. The program DEMO\_CDS\_VIEW\_EXTENSION uses the statement [SELECT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abapselect.htm) to access the enhanced view and also displays the components of the dictionary structures in question.

Addition 1   

... GROUP BY field1, field2, ...

Effect

This addition must be specified if elements not defined using aggregate expressions are added to a view with [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm). These elements must be specified after GROUP BY add extend the [GROUP-BY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_group_by_v1.htm) clause of the original view. With respect to the extended view, the extended GROUP-BY clause must follow the general rules for a GROUP-BY clause.

The addition cannot be specified if the definition of the original view does not contain any aggregate expressions in its SELECT list.

Hint

Extensions of a view with aggregate expressions require it to contain the annotation array viewEnhancementCategory\[ \] with the value #GROUP\_BY.

Example

The following CDS view extension

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_EXTAGG'
extend view demo\_cds\_aggregate with demo\_cds\_extend\_aggregate
  {
    connid,  
    sum(distance) as sum\_distance
  }
  group by
    connid;

extends the existing CDS view

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_AGG'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
@AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory: \[#PROJECTION\_LIST,#GROUP\_BY\]
define view demo\_cds\_aggregate
  as select from
    spfli  
    {
      carrid,
      sum(fltime) as sum\_fltime
    }
    group by
      carrid; .

A database field connid and an aggregate expression sum(distance) are added to the SELECT list. Accordingly, the addition GROUP BY must be used to add the database field to the GROUP-BY clause of the original view.

Addition 2   

... UNION *\[*ALL*\]* { ... }

Effect

This addition must be specified when a view with [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm) clauses is extended. A corresponding UNION addition must be specified for each UNION clause of the original view. The addition ALL must be specified each time it is specified in the associated UNION clause of the original view. The curly brackets can contain elements that extend the SELECT list of the associated UNION clause of the original view. As specified by the SELECT list extended using select\_list\_extension, the UNION clauses must be extended so that the rules for UNION clauses are not broken in the extended view.

The addition cannot be specified if the definition of the original view does not have a UNION clause.

Hint

Extensions of a view with UNION clauses require it to contain the annotation array viewEnhancementCategory\[ \] with the value #UNION.

Example

The following CDS view extension

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_EXTUNI'
extend view demo\_cds\_union with demo\_cds\_extend\_union
  {
    c as c3,
    d as c4
  }
union
  {
    f as c3,
    g as c4
  }
union all
  {
    k as c3,
    l as c4
  };

extends the existing CDS view

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_UIO'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
@AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory: \[#PROJECTION\_LIST,#UNION\]
define view demo\_cds\_union
  as select from
    demo\_join1
    {
      a as c1,
      b as c2
    }
union select from
  demo\_join2
    {
      d as c1,
      e as c2
    }
union all select from
  demo\_join3
    {
      i as c1,
      j as c2
    }; .

The original view has two UNION clauses represented using corresponding UNION additions in the definition of the CDS view extension. Two elements with matching types are added to the three SELECT lists of the original view.

Effect

Specifies an [annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_syntax.htm) as an extension annotation in the definition of a [CDS view extension](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_extend_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") before the statement [EXTEND VIEW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_extend_view.htm). The character @ must be placed in front of the name annotation of the annotation. The annotation should be defined as a CDS object in a [CDS annotation definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_anno_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and the annotation definition annotation [@Scope](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_anno_annos.htm) should be specified here using the value #EXTEND\_VIEW.

The following tables show the possible [ABAP annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenabap_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that can be specified and their meanings. The ABAP annotations are evaluated by the ABAP runtime framework for every CDS entity. Annotations with other identifiers are usually [framework-specific annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_frmwrk.htm). These are not evaluated by the ABAP runtime framework but by other SAP frameworks instead.

The first column of the table shows the (possibly structured) name annotation of an ABAP annotation and the second column shows its meaning. The third column shows the possible [annotation values](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenannotation_value_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The fourth column shows the default value which is used if the annotation is not used at all. The fifth column shows the default value set implicitly for value in accordance with the [annotation definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_anno_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") if the annotation is specified without a value. If nothing is specified for the annotation value, the annotation should be specified without a value.

-   Each definition of a CDS view extension must contain the ABAP annotation AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName that defines the name of the DDIC append view in ABAP Dictionary.
-   The name given to the DDIC append view can no longer be changed after the CDS view extension is transported into a follow-on system.

Effect

Extends an existing [CDS DDIC-based view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_v1_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") ddic\_based\_view using a [CDS view extension](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_extend_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") cds\_view\_extension in the [CDS DDL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_ddl_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). An existing CDS DDIC-based view can have one or more CDS view extensions.

The extended CDS view ddic\_based\_view must be specified under the name of its [CDS entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The name of the [CDS-managed DDIC view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_mngdddic_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") cannot be specified.

Prerequisite

As a prerequisite for the enhancement of the CDS view with the statement EXTEND VIEW, the elements of the [annotation array](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenannotation_array_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory\[ \]](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_anno_v1.htm) must be specified accordingly in its definition with [DEFINE VIEW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_define_view_v1.htm):

-   By default or if only the value #PROJECTION\_LIST is specified, views without [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm) in the SELECT list and without a [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm) clause can be extended.
-   In order to extend views that have [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm) in the SELECT list, the annotation array must contain the value #GROUP\_BY alongside #PROJECTION\_LIST.
-   In order to extend views that contain [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm) clauses, the annotation array must contain the value #UNION alongside #PROJECTION\_LIST.
-   If the annotation array contains the value #NONE, the view cannot be extended.

Components of a view extension

View extensions can make additions to the original view, but it can't modify, overwrite, or delete elements from the original view. The following components are possible in a CDS view extension:

-   The annotation [AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm) is mandatory. Further annotations [extension\_annot1](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm), [extension\_annot2](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm), ... can also be specified. This is optional.
-   New associations association1, association2 can be defined and exposed in the CDS view extension. The same rules apply that are described in topic [CDS DDL - DDIC-based view, ASSOCIATION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_simple_association_v1.htm).
    
    Note: It is not allowed to define new [CDS compositions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_composition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or [CDS to-parent associations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abento_parent_association_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in a view extension.
    
-   The elements of the extension list select\_list\_extension specified after EXTEND VIEW are added to the existing SELECT list. At least one element must be added. It is possible to access all fields of all data sources of the extended view in the extension list select\_list\_extension. The list can have all [elements](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_entry_v1.htm) of a [SELECT list](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_v1.htm), namely:
    -   [field](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_field_v2.htm) of a data source
    -   [Input parameters](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_parameter_v1.htm) of the extended CDS view. It is not possible to specify new input parameters in a view extension.
    -   It can expose a [CDS association](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_association_v2.htm) of the extended view or a newly defined association
    -   Using a [path expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_path_expression_v1.htm), a field of an association target can be included. Path expressions are possible for associations of the extended view or for newly defined associations.
    -   [literals, session variables, expressions and functions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_operands_and_expr_v1.htm)
        
        Note: To add aggregate expressions to a view extension, special rules apply. See below.
        
-   Aggregate expressions are possible in the SELECT list of a view extension only if the following conditions are met:
    -   The original view must contain [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm). If the original view does not contain any aggregate expressions, this is not possible.
    -   The extended view must be annotated with AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory \[#PROJECTION\_LIST, #GROUP\_BY\]
    -   If non-aggregated elements are added to a CDS view with aggregate expressions, then the [GROUP-BY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_group_by_v1.htm) clause must be extended using the addition GROUP BY
-   If the original view contains [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm), equivalent UNION additions must be used in the statement EXTEND VIEW. As a prerequisite, the extended view must be annotated with AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory \[#PROJECTION\_LIST, #UNION\]
    
    If an appended element already occurs in the existing SELECT list or if a different extension occurs, it must be given an alternative element name using AS.
    

Restrictions

-   CDS views with an explicit [name list](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_name_list_v1.htm) cannot currently be extended.
-   CDS view extensions themselves cannot be extended.
-   It is not possible to specify new input parameters in a view extension.
-   No addition [ROOT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_define_root_view_v1.htm) can be specified in the statement EXTEND VIEW to transform a regular view to a [root entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenroot_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
-   An appended field cannot be defined as a key field using KEY.
-   It is not allowed to define new to-parent or composition associations in a view extension.
-   For views that have an element of data type LRAW or LCHR in the SELECT list, no view extension is possible and the annotation AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory\[#NONE\] is enforced. The reason is that elements of data types LRAW or LCHR must always be in the last position of the SELECT list.

Naming

Two repository objects are created for a CDS view extension that is defined using EXTEND VIEW. A name must be specified for each of the two objects:

-   The actual name cds\_view\_extension of the CDS view extension is specified after the keywords EXTEND VIEW. This name follows the same rules as the name of an [DDIC append view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_append_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), but can have up to 30 characters.
-   The name CDS\_APPEND\_VIEW for an [append view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_append_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in ABAP Dictionary must be specified in quotation marks after the annotation [@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm). This name is subject to the same rules as the name of a [DDIC database view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abendatabase_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in ABAP Dictionary, see topic [DDIC - Naming Rules for DDIC Views](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_view_names.htm). The new DDIC append view extends the [CDS-managed DDIC view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_mngdddic_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the extended CDS view. The name given to the DDIC append view can no longer be changed after the CDS view extension is transported into a follow-on system.

The name of the new DDIC append view and of the actual CDS view extension should be located in the customer namespace (or in the namespace of a partner or special development) to protect it against being overwritten by upgrades or new releases.

-   Once the DDL source code of a CDS view extension has been transported, the actual name cds\_view\_extension and the name of the DDIC append view CDS\_APPEND\_VIEW can no longer be changed. The extended view ddic\_based\_view can also no longer be changed.

Note: The DDL source code of a CDS view extension does not need to have the same name as the CDS view extension entity, but it is advisable to use the name of the entity.

Hints

-   Currently it is not possible to define extension categories for CDS views. The following restrictions apply for this reason:
    -   CDS views have the property can be extended in any way with respect to the [extension category of DDIC structures](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_structures_enh_cat.htm). The consequences of this must be respected when extending a CDS view.
    -   The attributes of a CDS view defined using [annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_anno_v1.htm), such as switching on [table buffering](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abentable_buffering_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), cannot currently be modified using extensions.
-   CDS view extensions specified with EXTEND ENTITY are recommended for CDS DDIC-based views only. However, for compatibility and migration reasons, it is also possible to extend [CDS projection views](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_projection_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or [CDS view entities](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_v2_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") with the statement EXTEND VIEW. However, view extends defined using EXTEND VIEW don't support the syntax elements specific to projection views and CDS view entities. Therefore, it is recommended to use the statement [EXTEND VIEW ENTITY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_extend_view_entity.htm) for extensions of CDS projection views and CDS view entities instead.
-   If, for some reason, a CDS projection view or a CDS view entity is extended with EXTEND VIEW, the [CDS-managed DDIC view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_mngdddic_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is deleted (as CDS projection views and CDS view entities do not have any DDIC artefacts), and entity annotations referring to the CDS-managed DDIC view are ignored.

Example

The following CDS view extension

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_EXTENS'
extend view demo\_cds\_original\_view with demo\_cds\_view\_extension  
  {
    spfli.distance,
    spfli.distid as unit
  };

adds two view fields to the existing CDS view

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_ORIG'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
@AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory: \[#PROJECTION\_LIST\]
@EndUserText.label: 'Further information about the CDS entity'
define view demo\_cds\_original\_view  
  as select from
           spfli
      join scarr on
        scarr.carrid = spfli.carrid
    {
      key scarr.carrname     as carrier,
      key spfli.connid       as flight,
          spfli.cityfrom     as departure,
          spfli.cityto       as destination
    }; .

The DDIC append view DEMO\_CDS\_EXTENS is created in ABAP Dictionary. The program DEMO\_CDS\_VIEW\_EXTENSION uses the statement [SELECT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abapselect.htm) to access the enhanced view and also displays the components of the dictionary structures in question.

Addition 1   

... GROUP BY field1, field2, ...

Effect

This addition must be specified if elements not defined using aggregate expressions are added to a view with [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm). These elements must be specified after GROUP BY add extend the [GROUP-BY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_group_by_v1.htm) clause of the original view. With respect to the extended view, the extended GROUP-BY clause must follow the general rules for a GROUP-BY clause.

The addition cannot be specified if the definition of the original view does not contain any aggregate expressions in its SELECT list.

Hint

Extensions of a view with aggregate expressions require it to contain the annotation array viewEnhancementCategory\[ \] with the value #GROUP\_BY.

Example

The following CDS view extension

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_EXTAGG'
extend view demo\_cds\_aggregate with demo\_cds\_extend\_aggregate
  {
    connid,  
    sum(distance) as sum\_distance
  }
  group by
    connid;

extends the existing CDS view

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_AGG'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
@AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory: \[#PROJECTION\_LIST,#GROUP\_BY\]
define view demo\_cds\_aggregate
  as select from
    spfli  
    {
      carrid,
      sum(fltime) as sum\_fltime
    }
    group by
      carrid; .

A database field connid and an aggregate expression sum(distance) are added to the SELECT list. Accordingly, the addition GROUP BY must be used to add the database field to the GROUP-BY clause of the original view.

Addition 2   

... UNION *\[*ALL*\]* { ... }

Effect

This addition must be specified when a view with [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm) clauses is extended. A corresponding UNION addition must be specified for each UNION clause of the original view. The addition ALL must be specified each time it is specified in the associated UNION clause of the original view. The curly brackets can contain elements that extend the SELECT list of the associated UNION clause of the original view. As specified by the SELECT list extended using select\_list\_extension, the UNION clauses must be extended so that the rules for UNION clauses are not broken in the extended view.

The addition cannot be specified if the definition of the original view does not have a UNION clause.

Hint

Extensions of a view with UNION clauses require it to contain the annotation array viewEnhancementCategory\[ \] with the value #UNION.

Example

The following CDS view extension

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_EXTUNI'
extend view demo\_cds\_union with demo\_cds\_extend\_union
  {
    c as c3,
    d as c4
  }
union
  {
    f as c3,
    g as c4
  }
union all
  {
    k as c3,
    l as c4
  };

extends the existing CDS view

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_UIO'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
@AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory: \[#PROJECTION\_LIST,#UNION\]
define view demo\_cds\_union
  as select from
    demo\_join1
    {
      a as c1,
      b as c2
    }
union select from
  demo\_join2
    {
      d as c1,
      e as c2
    }
union all select from
  demo\_join3
    {
      i as c1,
      j as c2
    }; .

The original view has two UNION clauses represented using corresponding UNION additions in the definition of the CDS view extension. Two elements with matching types are added to the three SELECT lists of the original view.

Effect

Specifies an [annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_syntax.htm) as an extension annotation in the definition of a [CDS view extension](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_extend_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") before the statement [EXTEND VIEW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_extend_view.htm). The character @ must be placed in front of the name annotation of the annotation. The annotation should be defined as a CDS object in a [CDS annotation definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_anno_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and the annotation definition annotation [@Scope](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_anno_annos.htm) should be specified here using the value #EXTEND\_VIEW.

The following tables show the possible [ABAP annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenabap_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that can be specified and their meanings. The ABAP annotations are evaluated by the ABAP runtime framework for every CDS entity. Annotations with other identifiers are usually [framework-specific annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_frmwrk.htm). These are not evaluated by the ABAP runtime framework but by other SAP frameworks instead.

The first column of the table shows the (possibly structured) name annotation of an ABAP annotation and the second column shows its meaning. The third column shows the possible [annotation values](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenannotation_value_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The fourth column shows the default value which is used if the annotation is not used at all. The fifth column shows the default value set implicitly for value in accordance with the [annotation definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_anno_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") if the annotation is specified without a value. If nothing is specified for the annotation value, the annotation should be specified without a value.

-   Each definition of a CDS view extension must contain the ABAP annotation AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName that defines the name of the DDIC append view in ABAP Dictionary.
-   The name given to the DDIC append view can no longer be changed after the CDS view extension is transported into a follow-on system.

Effect

Extends an existing [CDS DDIC-based view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_v1_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") ddic\_based\_view using a [CDS view extension](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_extend_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") cds\_view\_extension in the [CDS DDL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_ddl_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). An existing CDS DDIC-based view can have one or more CDS view extensions.

The extended CDS view ddic\_based\_view must be specified under the name of its [CDS entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The name of the [CDS-managed DDIC view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_mngdddic_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") cannot be specified.

Prerequisite

As a prerequisite for the enhancement of the CDS view with the statement EXTEND VIEW, the elements of the [annotation array](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenannotation_array_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory\[ \]](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_anno_v1.htm) must be specified accordingly in its definition with [DEFINE VIEW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_define_view_v1.htm):

-   By default or if only the value #PROJECTION\_LIST is specified, views without [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm) in the SELECT list and without a [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm) clause can be extended.
-   In order to extend views that have [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm) in the SELECT list, the annotation array must contain the value #GROUP\_BY alongside #PROJECTION\_LIST.
-   In order to extend views that contain [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm) clauses, the annotation array must contain the value #UNION alongside #PROJECTION\_LIST.
-   If the annotation array contains the value #NONE, the view cannot be extended.

Components of a view extension

View extensions can make additions to the original view, but it can't modify, overwrite, or delete elements from the original view. The following components are possible in a CDS view extension:

-   The annotation [AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm) is mandatory. Further annotations [extension\_annot1](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm), [extension\_annot2](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm), ... can also be specified. This is optional.
-   New associations association1, association2 can be defined and exposed in the CDS view extension. The same rules apply that are described in topic [CDS DDL - DDIC-based view, ASSOCIATION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_simple_association_v1.htm).
    
    Note: It is not allowed to define new [CDS compositions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_composition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or [CDS to-parent associations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abento_parent_association_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in a view extension.
    
-   The elements of the extension list select\_list\_extension specified after EXTEND VIEW are added to the existing SELECT list. At least one element must be added. It is possible to access all fields of all data sources of the extended view in the extension list select\_list\_extension. The list can have all [elements](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_entry_v1.htm) of a [SELECT list](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_v1.htm), namely:
    -   [field](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_field_v2.htm) of a data source
    -   [Input parameters](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_parameter_v1.htm) of the extended CDS view. It is not possible to specify new input parameters in a view extension.
    -   It can expose a [CDS association](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_association_v2.htm) of the extended view or a newly defined association
    -   Using a [path expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_path_expression_v1.htm), a field of an association target can be included. Path expressions are possible for associations of the extended view or for newly defined associations.
    -   [literals, session variables, expressions and functions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_operands_and_expr_v1.htm)
        
        Note: To add aggregate expressions to a view extension, special rules apply. See below.
        
-   Aggregate expressions are possible in the SELECT list of a view extension only if the following conditions are met:
    -   The original view must contain [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm). If the original view does not contain any aggregate expressions, this is not possible.
    -   The extended view must be annotated with AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory \[#PROJECTION\_LIST, #GROUP\_BY\]
    -   If non-aggregated elements are added to a CDS view with aggregate expressions, then the [GROUP-BY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_group_by_v1.htm) clause must be extended using the addition GROUP BY
-   If the original view contains [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm), equivalent UNION additions must be used in the statement EXTEND VIEW. As a prerequisite, the extended view must be annotated with AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory \[#PROJECTION\_LIST, #UNION\]
    
    If an appended element already occurs in the existing SELECT list or if a different extension occurs, it must be given an alternative element name using AS.
    

Restrictions

-   CDS views with an explicit [name list](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_name_list_v1.htm) cannot currently be extended.
-   CDS view extensions themselves cannot be extended.
-   It is not possible to specify new input parameters in a view extension.
-   No addition [ROOT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_define_root_view_v1.htm) can be specified in the statement EXTEND VIEW to transform a regular view to a [root entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenroot_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
-   An appended field cannot be defined as a key field using KEY.
-   It is not allowed to define new to-parent or composition associations in a view extension.
-   For views that have an element of data type LRAW or LCHR in the SELECT list, no view extension is possible and the annotation AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory\[#NONE\] is enforced. The reason is that elements of data types LRAW or LCHR must always be in the last position of the SELECT list.

Naming

Two repository objects are created for a CDS view extension that is defined using EXTEND VIEW. A name must be specified for each of the two objects:

-   The actual name cds\_view\_extension of the CDS view extension is specified after the keywords EXTEND VIEW. This name follows the same rules as the name of an [DDIC append view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_append_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), but can have up to 30 characters.
-   The name CDS\_APPEND\_VIEW for an [append view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_append_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in ABAP Dictionary must be specified in quotation marks after the annotation [@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm). This name is subject to the same rules as the name of a [DDIC database view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abendatabase_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in ABAP Dictionary, see topic [DDIC - Naming Rules for DDIC Views](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_view_names.htm). The new DDIC append view extends the [CDS-managed DDIC view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_mngdddic_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the extended CDS view. The name given to the DDIC append view can no longer be changed after the CDS view extension is transported into a follow-on system.

The name of the new DDIC append view and of the actual CDS view extension should be located in the customer namespace (or in the namespace of a partner or special development) to protect it against being overwritten by upgrades or new releases.

-   Once the DDL source code of a CDS view extension has been transported, the actual name cds\_view\_extension and the name of the DDIC append view CDS\_APPEND\_VIEW can no longer be changed. The extended view ddic\_based\_view can also no longer be changed.

Note: The DDL source code of a CDS view extension does not need to have the same name as the CDS view extension entity, but it is advisable to use the name of the entity.

Hints

-   Currently it is not possible to define extension categories for CDS views. The following restrictions apply for this reason:
    -   CDS views have the property can be extended in any way with respect to the [extension category of DDIC structures](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_structures_enh_cat.htm). The consequences of this must be respected when extending a CDS view.
    -   The attributes of a CDS view defined using [annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_anno_v1.htm), such as switching on [table buffering](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abentable_buffering_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), cannot currently be modified using extensions.
-   CDS view extensions specified with EXTEND ENTITY are recommended for CDS DDIC-based views only. However, for compatibility and migration reasons, it is also possible to extend [CDS projection views](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_projection_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or [CDS view entities](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_v2_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") with the statement EXTEND VIEW. However, view extends defined using EXTEND VIEW don't support the syntax elements specific to projection views and CDS view entities. Therefore, it is recommended to use the statement [EXTEND VIEW ENTITY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_extend_view_entity.htm) for extensions of CDS projection views and CDS view entities instead.
-   If, for some reason, a CDS projection view or a CDS view entity is extended with EXTEND VIEW, the [CDS-managed DDIC view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_mngdddic_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is deleted (as CDS projection views and CDS view entities do not have any DDIC artefacts), and entity annotations referring to the CDS-managed DDIC view are ignored.

Example

The following CDS view extension

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_EXTENS'
extend view demo\_cds\_original\_view with demo\_cds\_view\_extension  
  {
    spfli.distance,
    spfli.distid as unit
  };

adds two view fields to the existing CDS view

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_ORIG'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
@AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory: \[#PROJECTION\_LIST\]
@EndUserText.label: 'Further information about the CDS entity'
define view demo\_cds\_original\_view  
  as select from
           spfli
      join scarr on
        scarr.carrid = spfli.carrid
    {
      key scarr.carrname     as carrier,
      key spfli.connid       as flight,
          spfli.cityfrom     as departure,
          spfli.cityto       as destination
    }; .

The DDIC append view DEMO\_CDS\_EXTENS is created in ABAP Dictionary. The program DEMO\_CDS\_VIEW\_EXTENSION uses the statement [SELECT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abapselect.htm) to access the enhanced view and also displays the components of the dictionary structures in question.

Addition 1   

... GROUP BY field1, field2, ...

Effect

This addition must be specified if elements not defined using aggregate expressions are added to a view with [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm). These elements must be specified after GROUP BY add extend the [GROUP-BY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_group_by_v1.htm) clause of the original view. With respect to the extended view, the extended GROUP-BY clause must follow the general rules for a GROUP-BY clause.

The addition cannot be specified if the definition of the original view does not contain any aggregate expressions in its SELECT list.

Hint

Extensions of a view with aggregate expressions require it to contain the annotation array viewEnhancementCategory\[ \] with the value #GROUP\_BY.

Example

The following CDS view extension

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_EXTAGG'
extend view demo\_cds\_aggregate with demo\_cds\_extend\_aggregate
  {
    connid,  
    sum(distance) as sum\_distance
  }
  group by
    connid;

extends the existing CDS view

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_AGG'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
@AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory: \[#PROJECTION\_LIST,#GROUP\_BY\]
define view demo\_cds\_aggregate
  as select from
    spfli  
    {
      carrid,
      sum(fltime) as sum\_fltime
    }
    group by
      carrid; .

A database field connid and an aggregate expression sum(distance) are added to the SELECT list. Accordingly, the addition GROUP BY must be used to add the database field to the GROUP-BY clause of the original view.

Addition 2   

... UNION *\[*ALL*\]* { ... }

Effect

This addition must be specified when a view with [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm) clauses is extended. A corresponding UNION addition must be specified for each UNION clause of the original view. The addition ALL must be specified each time it is specified in the associated UNION clause of the original view. The curly brackets can contain elements that extend the SELECT list of the associated UNION clause of the original view. As specified by the SELECT list extended using select\_list\_extension, the UNION clauses must be extended so that the rules for UNION clauses are not broken in the extended view.

The addition cannot be specified if the definition of the original view does not have a UNION clause.

Hint

Extensions of a view with UNION clauses require it to contain the annotation array viewEnhancementCategory\[ \] with the value #UNION.

Example

The following CDS view extension

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_EXTUNI'
extend view demo\_cds\_union with demo\_cds\_extend\_union
  {
    c as c3,
    d as c4
  }
union
  {
    f as c3,
    g as c4
  }
union all
  {
    k as c3,
    l as c4
  };

extends the existing CDS view

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_UIO'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
@AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory: \[#PROJECTION\_LIST,#UNION\]
define view demo\_cds\_union
  as select from
    demo\_join1
    {
      a as c1,
      b as c2
    }
union select from
  demo\_join2
    {
      d as c1,
      e as c2
    }
union all select from
  demo\_join3
    {
      i as c1,
      j as c2
    }; .

The original view has two UNION clauses represented using corresponding UNION additions in the definition of the CDS view extension. Two elements with matching types are added to the three SELECT lists of the original view.

Effect

Specifies an [annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_syntax.htm) as an extension annotation in the definition of a [CDS view extension](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_extend_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") before the statement [EXTEND VIEW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_extend_view.htm). The character @ must be placed in front of the name annotation of the annotation. The annotation should be defined as a CDS object in a [CDS annotation definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_anno_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and the annotation definition annotation [@Scope](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_anno_annos.htm) should be specified here using the value #EXTEND\_VIEW.

The following tables show the possible [ABAP annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenabap_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that can be specified and their meanings. The ABAP annotations are evaluated by the ABAP runtime framework for every CDS entity. Annotations with other identifiers are usually [framework-specific annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_frmwrk.htm). These are not evaluated by the ABAP runtime framework but by other SAP frameworks instead.

The first column of the table shows the (possibly structured) name annotation of an ABAP annotation and the second column shows its meaning. The third column shows the possible [annotation values](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenannotation_value_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The fourth column shows the default value which is used if the annotation is not used at all. The fifth column shows the default value set implicitly for value in accordance with the [annotation definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_anno_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") if the annotation is specified without a value. If nothing is specified for the annotation value, the annotation should be specified without a value.

-   Each definition of a CDS view extension must contain the ABAP annotation AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName that defines the name of the DDIC append view in ABAP Dictionary.
-   The name given to the DDIC append view can no longer be changed after the CDS view extension is transported into a follow-on system.

Effect

Extends an existing [CDS DDIC-based view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_v1_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") ddic\_based\_view using a [CDS view extension](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_extend_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") cds\_view\_extension in the [CDS DDL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_ddl_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). An existing CDS DDIC-based view can have one or more CDS view extensions.

The extended CDS view ddic\_based\_view must be specified under the name of its [CDS entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The name of the [CDS-managed DDIC view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_mngdddic_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") cannot be specified.

Prerequisite

As a prerequisite for the enhancement of the CDS view with the statement EXTEND VIEW, the elements of the [annotation array](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenannotation_array_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory\[ \]](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_anno_v1.htm) must be specified accordingly in its definition with [DEFINE VIEW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_define_view_v1.htm):

-   By default or if only the value #PROJECTION\_LIST is specified, views without [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm) in the SELECT list and without a [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm) clause can be extended.
-   In order to extend views that have [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm) in the SELECT list, the annotation array must contain the value #GROUP\_BY alongside #PROJECTION\_LIST.
-   In order to extend views that contain [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm) clauses, the annotation array must contain the value #UNION alongside #PROJECTION\_LIST.
-   If the annotation array contains the value #NONE, the view cannot be extended.

Components of a view extension

View extensions can make additions to the original view, but it can't modify, overwrite, or delete elements from the original view. The following components are possible in a CDS view extension:

-   The annotation [AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm) is mandatory. Further annotations [extension\_annot1](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm), [extension\_annot2](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm), ... can also be specified. This is optional.
-   New associations association1, association2 can be defined and exposed in the CDS view extension. The same rules apply that are described in topic [CDS DDL - DDIC-based view, ASSOCIATION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_simple_association_v1.htm).
    
    Note: It is not allowed to define new [CDS compositions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_composition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or [CDS to-parent associations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abento_parent_association_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in a view extension.
    
-   The elements of the extension list select\_list\_extension specified after EXTEND VIEW are added to the existing SELECT list. At least one element must be added. It is possible to access all fields of all data sources of the extended view in the extension list select\_list\_extension. The list can have all [elements](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_entry_v1.htm) of a [SELECT list](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_v1.htm), namely:
    -   [field](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_field_v2.htm) of a data source
    -   [Input parameters](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_parameter_v1.htm) of the extended CDS view. It is not possible to specify new input parameters in a view extension.
    -   It can expose a [CDS association](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_association_v2.htm) of the extended view or a newly defined association
    -   Using a [path expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_path_expression_v1.htm), a field of an association target can be included. Path expressions are possible for associations of the extended view or for newly defined associations.
    -   [literals, session variables, expressions and functions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_operands_and_expr_v1.htm)
        
        Note: To add aggregate expressions to a view extension, special rules apply. See below.
        
-   Aggregate expressions are possible in the SELECT list of a view extension only if the following conditions are met:
    -   The original view must contain [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm). If the original view does not contain any aggregate expressions, this is not possible.
    -   The extended view must be annotated with AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory \[#PROJECTION\_LIST, #GROUP\_BY\]
    -   If non-aggregated elements are added to a CDS view with aggregate expressions, then the [GROUP-BY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_group_by_v1.htm) clause must be extended using the addition GROUP BY
-   If the original view contains [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm), equivalent UNION additions must be used in the statement EXTEND VIEW. As a prerequisite, the extended view must be annotated with AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory \[#PROJECTION\_LIST, #UNION\]
    
    If an appended element already occurs in the existing SELECT list or if a different extension occurs, it must be given an alternative element name using AS.
    

Restrictions

-   CDS views with an explicit [name list](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_name_list_v1.htm) cannot currently be extended.
-   CDS view extensions themselves cannot be extended.
-   It is not possible to specify new input parameters in a view extension.
-   No addition [ROOT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_define_root_view_v1.htm) can be specified in the statement EXTEND VIEW to transform a regular view to a [root entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenroot_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
-   An appended field cannot be defined as a key field using KEY.
-   It is not allowed to define new to-parent or composition associations in a view extension.
-   For views that have an element of data type LRAW or LCHR in the SELECT list, no view extension is possible and the annotation AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory\[#NONE\] is enforced. The reason is that elements of data types LRAW or LCHR must always be in the last position of the SELECT list.

Naming

Two repository objects are created for a CDS view extension that is defined using EXTEND VIEW. A name must be specified for each of the two objects:

-   The actual name cds\_view\_extension of the CDS view extension is specified after the keywords EXTEND VIEW. This name follows the same rules as the name of an [DDIC append view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_append_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), but can have up to 30 characters.
-   The name CDS\_APPEND\_VIEW for an [append view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_append_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in ABAP Dictionary must be specified in quotation marks after the annotation [@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm). This name is subject to the same rules as the name of a [DDIC database view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abendatabase_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in ABAP Dictionary, see topic [DDIC - Naming Rules for DDIC Views](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_view_names.htm). The new DDIC append view extends the [CDS-managed DDIC view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_mngdddic_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the extended CDS view. The name given to the DDIC append view can no longer be changed after the CDS view extension is transported into a follow-on system.

The name of the new DDIC append view and of the actual CDS view extension should be located in the customer namespace (or in the namespace of a partner or special development) to protect it against being overwritten by upgrades or new releases.

-   Once the DDL source code of a CDS view extension has been transported, the actual name cds\_view\_extension and the name of the DDIC append view CDS\_APPEND\_VIEW can no longer be changed. The extended view ddic\_based\_view can also no longer be changed.

Note: The DDL source code of a CDS view extension does not need to have the same name as the CDS view extension entity, but it is advisable to use the name of the entity.

Hints

-   Currently it is not possible to define extension categories for CDS views. The following restrictions apply for this reason:
    -   CDS views have the property can be extended in any way with respect to the [extension category of DDIC structures](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_structures_enh_cat.htm). The consequences of this must be respected when extending a CDS view.
    -   The attributes of a CDS view defined using [annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_anno_v1.htm), such as switching on [table buffering](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abentable_buffering_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), cannot currently be modified using extensions.
-   CDS view extensions specified with EXTEND ENTITY are recommended for CDS DDIC-based views only. However, for compatibility and migration reasons, it is also possible to extend [CDS projection views](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_projection_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or [CDS view entities](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_v2_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") with the statement EXTEND VIEW. However, view extends defined using EXTEND VIEW don't support the syntax elements specific to projection views and CDS view entities. Therefore, it is recommended to use the statement [EXTEND VIEW ENTITY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_extend_view_entity.htm) for extensions of CDS projection views and CDS view entities instead.
-   If, for some reason, a CDS projection view or a CDS view entity is extended with EXTEND VIEW, the [CDS-managed DDIC view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_mngdddic_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is deleted (as CDS projection views and CDS view entities do not have any DDIC artefacts), and entity annotations referring to the CDS-managed DDIC view are ignored.

Example

The following CDS view extension

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_EXTENS'
extend view demo\_cds\_original\_view with demo\_cds\_view\_extension  
  {
    spfli.distance,
    spfli.distid as unit
  };

adds two view fields to the existing CDS view

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_ORIG'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
@AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory: \[#PROJECTION\_LIST\]
@EndUserText.label: 'Further information about the CDS entity'
define view demo\_cds\_original\_view  
  as select from
           spfli
      join scarr on
        scarr.carrid = spfli.carrid
    {
      key scarr.carrname     as carrier,
      key spfli.connid       as flight,
          spfli.cityfrom     as departure,
          spfli.cityto       as destination
    }; .

The DDIC append view DEMO\_CDS\_EXTENS is created in ABAP Dictionary. The program DEMO\_CDS\_VIEW\_EXTENSION uses the statement [SELECT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abapselect.htm) to access the enhanced view and also displays the components of the dictionary structures in question.

Addition 1   

... GROUP BY field1, field2, ...

Effect

This addition must be specified if elements not defined using aggregate expressions are added to a view with [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm). These elements must be specified after GROUP BY add extend the [GROUP-BY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_group_by_v1.htm) clause of the original view. With respect to the extended view, the extended GROUP-BY clause must follow the general rules for a GROUP-BY clause.

The addition cannot be specified if the definition of the original view does not contain any aggregate expressions in its SELECT list.

Hint

Extensions of a view with aggregate expressions require it to contain the annotation array viewEnhancementCategory\[ \] with the value #GROUP\_BY.

Example

The following CDS view extension

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_EXTAGG'
extend view demo\_cds\_aggregate with demo\_cds\_extend\_aggregate
  {
    connid,  
    sum(distance) as sum\_distance
  }
  group by
    connid;

extends the existing CDS view

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_AGG'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
@AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory: \[#PROJECTION\_LIST,#GROUP\_BY\]
define view demo\_cds\_aggregate
  as select from
    spfli  
    {
      carrid,
      sum(fltime) as sum\_fltime
    }
    group by
      carrid; .

A database field connid and an aggregate expression sum(distance) are added to the SELECT list. Accordingly, the addition GROUP BY must be used to add the database field to the GROUP-BY clause of the original view.

Addition 2   

... UNION *\[*ALL*\]* { ... }

Effect

This addition must be specified when a view with [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm) clauses is extended. A corresponding UNION addition must be specified for each UNION clause of the original view. The addition ALL must be specified each time it is specified in the associated UNION clause of the original view. The curly brackets can contain elements that extend the SELECT list of the associated UNION clause of the original view. As specified by the SELECT list extended using select\_list\_extension, the UNION clauses must be extended so that the rules for UNION clauses are not broken in the extended view.

The addition cannot be specified if the definition of the original view does not have a UNION clause.

Hint

Extensions of a view with UNION clauses require it to contain the annotation array viewEnhancementCategory\[ \] with the value #UNION.

Example

The following CDS view extension

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_EXTUNI'
extend view demo\_cds\_union with demo\_cds\_extend\_union
  {
    c as c3,
    d as c4
  }
union
  {
    f as c3,
    g as c4
  }
union all
  {
    k as c3,
    l as c4
  };

extends the existing CDS view

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_UIO'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
@AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory: \[#PROJECTION\_LIST,#UNION\]
define view demo\_cds\_union
  as select from
    demo\_join1
    {
      a as c1,
      b as c2
    }
union select from
  demo\_join2
    {
      d as c1,
      e as c2
    }
union all select from
  demo\_join3
    {
      i as c1,
      j as c2
    }; .

The original view has two UNION clauses represented using corresponding UNION additions in the definition of the CDS view extension. Two elements with matching types are added to the three SELECT lists of the original view.

Effect

Specifies an [annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_syntax.htm) as an extension annotation in the definition of a [CDS view extension](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_extend_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") before the statement [EXTEND VIEW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_extend_view.htm). The character @ must be placed in front of the name annotation of the annotation. The annotation should be defined as a CDS object in a [CDS annotation definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_anno_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and the annotation definition annotation [@Scope](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_anno_annos.htm) should be specified here using the value #EXTEND\_VIEW.

The following tables show the possible [ABAP annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenabap_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that can be specified and their meanings. The ABAP annotations are evaluated by the ABAP runtime framework for every CDS entity. Annotations with other identifiers are usually [framework-specific annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_frmwrk.htm). These are not evaluated by the ABAP runtime framework but by other SAP frameworks instead.

The first column of the table shows the (possibly structured) name annotation of an ABAP annotation and the second column shows its meaning. The third column shows the possible [annotation values](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenannotation_value_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The fourth column shows the default value which is used if the annotation is not used at all. The fifth column shows the default value set implicitly for value in accordance with the [annotation definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_anno_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") if the annotation is specified without a value. If nothing is specified for the annotation value, the annotation should be specified without a value.

-   Each definition of a CDS view extension must contain the ABAP annotation AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName that defines the name of the DDIC append view in ABAP Dictionary.
-   The name given to the DDIC append view can no longer be changed after the CDS view extension is transported into a follow-on system.

Effect

Extends an existing [CDS DDIC-based view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_v1_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") ddic\_based\_view using a [CDS view extension](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_extend_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") cds\_view\_extension in the [CDS DDL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_ddl_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). An existing CDS DDIC-based view can have one or more CDS view extensions.

The extended CDS view ddic\_based\_view must be specified under the name of its [CDS entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The name of the [CDS-managed DDIC view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_mngdddic_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") cannot be specified.

Prerequisite

As a prerequisite for the enhancement of the CDS view with the statement EXTEND VIEW, the elements of the [annotation array](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenannotation_array_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory\[ \]](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_anno_v1.htm) must be specified accordingly in its definition with [DEFINE VIEW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_define_view_v1.htm):

-   By default or if only the value #PROJECTION\_LIST is specified, views without [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm) in the SELECT list and without a [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm) clause can be extended.
-   In order to extend views that have [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm) in the SELECT list, the annotation array must contain the value #GROUP\_BY alongside #PROJECTION\_LIST.
-   In order to extend views that contain [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm) clauses, the annotation array must contain the value #UNION alongside #PROJECTION\_LIST.
-   If the annotation array contains the value #NONE, the view cannot be extended.

Components of a view extension

View extensions can make additions to the original view, but it can't modify, overwrite, or delete elements from the original view. The following components are possible in a CDS view extension:

-   The annotation [AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm) is mandatory. Further annotations [extension\_annot1](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm), [extension\_annot2](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm), ... can also be specified. This is optional.
-   New associations association1, association2 can be defined and exposed in the CDS view extension. The same rules apply that are described in topic [CDS DDL - DDIC-based view, ASSOCIATION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_simple_association_v1.htm).
    
    Note: It is not allowed to define new [CDS compositions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_composition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or [CDS to-parent associations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abento_parent_association_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in a view extension.
    
-   The elements of the extension list select\_list\_extension specified after EXTEND VIEW are added to the existing SELECT list. At least one element must be added. It is possible to access all fields of all data sources of the extended view in the extension list select\_list\_extension. The list can have all [elements](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_entry_v1.htm) of a [SELECT list](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_v1.htm), namely:
    -   [field](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_field_v2.htm) of a data source
    -   [Input parameters](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_parameter_v1.htm) of the extended CDS view. It is not possible to specify new input parameters in a view extension.
    -   It can expose a [CDS association](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_association_v2.htm) of the extended view or a newly defined association
    -   Using a [path expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_path_expression_v1.htm), a field of an association target can be included. Path expressions are possible for associations of the extended view or for newly defined associations.
    -   [literals, session variables, expressions and functions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_operands_and_expr_v1.htm)
        
        Note: To add aggregate expressions to a view extension, special rules apply. See below.
        
-   Aggregate expressions are possible in the SELECT list of a view extension only if the following conditions are met:
    -   The original view must contain [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm). If the original view does not contain any aggregate expressions, this is not possible.
    -   The extended view must be annotated with AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory \[#PROJECTION\_LIST, #GROUP\_BY\]
    -   If non-aggregated elements are added to a CDS view with aggregate expressions, then the [GROUP-BY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_group_by_v1.htm) clause must be extended using the addition GROUP BY
-   If the original view contains [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm), equivalent UNION additions must be used in the statement EXTEND VIEW. As a prerequisite, the extended view must be annotated with AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory \[#PROJECTION\_LIST, #UNION\]
    
    If an appended element already occurs in the existing SELECT list or if a different extension occurs, it must be given an alternative element name using AS.
    

Restrictions

-   CDS views with an explicit [name list](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_name_list_v1.htm) cannot currently be extended.
-   CDS view extensions themselves cannot be extended.
-   It is not possible to specify new input parameters in a view extension.
-   No addition [ROOT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_define_root_view_v1.htm) can be specified in the statement EXTEND VIEW to transform a regular view to a [root entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenroot_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
-   An appended field cannot be defined as a key field using KEY.
-   It is not allowed to define new to-parent or composition associations in a view extension.
-   For views that have an element of data type LRAW or LCHR in the SELECT list, no view extension is possible and the annotation AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory\[#NONE\] is enforced. The reason is that elements of data types LRAW or LCHR must always be in the last position of the SELECT list.

Naming

Two repository objects are created for a CDS view extension that is defined using EXTEND VIEW. A name must be specified for each of the two objects:

-   The actual name cds\_view\_extension of the CDS view extension is specified after the keywords EXTEND VIEW. This name follows the same rules as the name of an [DDIC append view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_append_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), but can have up to 30 characters.
-   The name CDS\_APPEND\_VIEW for an [append view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_append_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in ABAP Dictionary must be specified in quotation marks after the annotation [@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm). This name is subject to the same rules as the name of a [DDIC database view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abendatabase_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in ABAP Dictionary, see topic [DDIC - Naming Rules for DDIC Views](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_view_names.htm). The new DDIC append view extends the [CDS-managed DDIC view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_mngdddic_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the extended CDS view. The name given to the DDIC append view can no longer be changed after the CDS view extension is transported into a follow-on system.

The name of the new DDIC append view and of the actual CDS view extension should be located in the customer namespace (or in the namespace of a partner or special development) to protect it against being overwritten by upgrades or new releases.

-   Once the DDL source code of a CDS view extension has been transported, the actual name cds\_view\_extension and the name of the DDIC append view CDS\_APPEND\_VIEW can no longer be changed. The extended view ddic\_based\_view can also no longer be changed.

Note: The DDL source code of a CDS view extension does not need to have the same name as the CDS view extension entity, but it is advisable to use the name of the entity.

Hints

-   Currently it is not possible to define extension categories for CDS views. The following restrictions apply for this reason:
    -   CDS views have the property can be extended in any way with respect to the [extension category of DDIC structures](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_structures_enh_cat.htm). The consequences of this must be respected when extending a CDS view.
    -   The attributes of a CDS view defined using [annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_anno_v1.htm), such as switching on [table buffering](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abentable_buffering_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), cannot currently be modified using extensions.
-   CDS view extensions specified with EXTEND ENTITY are recommended for CDS DDIC-based views only. However, for compatibility and migration reasons, it is also possible to extend [CDS projection views](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_projection_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or [CDS view entities](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_v2_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") with the statement EXTEND VIEW. However, view extends defined using EXTEND VIEW don't support the syntax elements specific to projection views and CDS view entities. Therefore, it is recommended to use the statement [EXTEND VIEW ENTITY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_extend_view_entity.htm) for extensions of CDS projection views and CDS view entities instead.
-   If, for some reason, a CDS projection view or a CDS view entity is extended with EXTEND VIEW, the [CDS-managed DDIC view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_mngdddic_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is deleted (as CDS projection views and CDS view entities do not have any DDIC artefacts), and entity annotations referring to the CDS-managed DDIC view are ignored.

Example

The following CDS view extension

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_EXTENS'
extend view demo\_cds\_original\_view with demo\_cds\_view\_extension  
  {
    spfli.distance,
    spfli.distid as unit
  };

adds two view fields to the existing CDS view

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_ORIG'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
@AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory: \[#PROJECTION\_LIST\]
@EndUserText.label: 'Further information about the CDS entity'
define view demo\_cds\_original\_view  
  as select from
           spfli
      join scarr on
        scarr.carrid = spfli.carrid
    {
      key scarr.carrname     as carrier,
      key spfli.connid       as flight,
          spfli.cityfrom     as departure,
          spfli.cityto       as destination
    }; .

The DDIC append view DEMO\_CDS\_EXTENS is created in ABAP Dictionary. The program DEMO\_CDS\_VIEW\_EXTENSION uses the statement [SELECT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abapselect.htm) to access the enhanced view and also displays the components of the dictionary structures in question.

Addition 1   

... GROUP BY field1, field2, ...

Effect

This addition must be specified if elements not defined using aggregate expressions are added to a view with [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm). These elements must be specified after GROUP BY add extend the [GROUP-BY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_group_by_v1.htm) clause of the original view. With respect to the extended view, the extended GROUP-BY clause must follow the general rules for a GROUP-BY clause.

The addition cannot be specified if the definition of the original view does not contain any aggregate expressions in its SELECT list.

Hint

Extensions of a view with aggregate expressions require it to contain the annotation array viewEnhancementCategory\[ \] with the value #GROUP\_BY.

Example

The following CDS view extension

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_EXTAGG'
extend view demo\_cds\_aggregate with demo\_cds\_extend\_aggregate
  {
    connid,  
    sum(distance) as sum\_distance
  }
  group by
    connid;

extends the existing CDS view

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_AGG'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
@AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory: \[#PROJECTION\_LIST,#GROUP\_BY\]
define view demo\_cds\_aggregate
  as select from
    spfli  
    {
      carrid,
      sum(fltime) as sum\_fltime
    }
    group by
      carrid; .

A database field connid and an aggregate expression sum(distance) are added to the SELECT list. Accordingly, the addition GROUP BY must be used to add the database field to the GROUP-BY clause of the original view.

Addition 2   

... UNION *\[*ALL*\]* { ... }

Effect

This addition must be specified when a view with [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm) clauses is extended. A corresponding UNION addition must be specified for each UNION clause of the original view. The addition ALL must be specified each time it is specified in the associated UNION clause of the original view. The curly brackets can contain elements that extend the SELECT list of the associated UNION clause of the original view. As specified by the SELECT list extended using select\_list\_extension, the UNION clauses must be extended so that the rules for UNION clauses are not broken in the extended view.

The addition cannot be specified if the definition of the original view does not have a UNION clause.

Hint

Extensions of a view with UNION clauses require it to contain the annotation array viewEnhancementCategory\[ \] with the value #UNION.

Example

The following CDS view extension

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_EXTUNI'
extend view demo\_cds\_union with demo\_cds\_extend\_union
  {
    c as c3,
    d as c4
  }
union
  {
    f as c3,
    g as c4
  }
union all
  {
    k as c3,
    l as c4
  };

extends the existing CDS view

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_UIO'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
@AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory: \[#PROJECTION\_LIST,#UNION\]
define view demo\_cds\_union
  as select from
    demo\_join1
    {
      a as c1,
      b as c2
    }
union select from
  demo\_join2
    {
      d as c1,
      e as c2
    }
union all select from
  demo\_join3
    {
      i as c1,
      j as c2
    }; .

The original view has two UNION clauses represented using corresponding UNION additions in the definition of the CDS view extension. Two elements with matching types are added to the three SELECT lists of the original view.

Effect

Specifies an [annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_syntax.htm) as an extension annotation in the definition of a [CDS view extension](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_extend_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") before the statement [EXTEND VIEW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_extend_view.htm). The character @ must be placed in front of the name annotation of the annotation. The annotation should be defined as a CDS object in a [CDS annotation definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_anno_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and the annotation definition annotation [@Scope](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_anno_annos.htm) should be specified here using the value #EXTEND\_VIEW.

The following tables show the possible [ABAP annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenabap_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that can be specified and their meanings. The ABAP annotations are evaluated by the ABAP runtime framework for every CDS entity. Annotations with other identifiers are usually [framework-specific annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_frmwrk.htm). These are not evaluated by the ABAP runtime framework but by other SAP frameworks instead.

The first column of the table shows the (possibly structured) name annotation of an ABAP annotation and the second column shows its meaning. The third column shows the possible [annotation values](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenannotation_value_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The fourth column shows the default value which is used if the annotation is not used at all. The fifth column shows the default value set implicitly for value in accordance with the [annotation definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_anno_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") if the annotation is specified without a value. If nothing is specified for the annotation value, the annotation should be specified without a value.

-   Each definition of a CDS view extension must contain the ABAP annotation AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName that defines the name of the DDIC append view in ABAP Dictionary.
-   The name given to the DDIC append view can no longer be changed after the CDS view extension is transported into a follow-on system.

Effect

Extends an existing [CDS DDIC-based view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_v1_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") ddic\_based\_view using a [CDS view extension](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_extend_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") cds\_view\_extension in the [CDS DDL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_ddl_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). An existing CDS DDIC-based view can have one or more CDS view extensions.

The extended CDS view ddic\_based\_view must be specified under the name of its [CDS entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The name of the [CDS-managed DDIC view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_mngdddic_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") cannot be specified.

Prerequisite

As a prerequisite for the enhancement of the CDS view with the statement EXTEND VIEW, the elements of the [annotation array](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenannotation_array_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory\[ \]](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_anno_v1.htm) must be specified accordingly in its definition with [DEFINE VIEW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_define_view_v1.htm):

-   By default or if only the value #PROJECTION\_LIST is specified, views without [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm) in the SELECT list and without a [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm) clause can be extended.
-   In order to extend views that have [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm) in the SELECT list, the annotation array must contain the value #GROUP\_BY alongside #PROJECTION\_LIST.
-   In order to extend views that contain [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm) clauses, the annotation array must contain the value #UNION alongside #PROJECTION\_LIST.
-   If the annotation array contains the value #NONE, the view cannot be extended.

Components of a view extension

View extensions can make additions to the original view, but it can't modify, overwrite, or delete elements from the original view. The following components are possible in a CDS view extension:

-   The annotation [AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm) is mandatory. Further annotations [extension\_annot1](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm), [extension\_annot2](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm), ... can also be specified. This is optional.
-   New associations association1, association2 can be defined and exposed in the CDS view extension. The same rules apply that are described in topic [CDS DDL - DDIC-based view, ASSOCIATION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_simple_association_v1.htm).
    
    Note: It is not allowed to define new [CDS compositions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_composition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or [CDS to-parent associations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abento_parent_association_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in a view extension.
    
-   The elements of the extension list select\_list\_extension specified after EXTEND VIEW are added to the existing SELECT list. At least one element must be added. It is possible to access all fields of all data sources of the extended view in the extension list select\_list\_extension. The list can have all [elements](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_entry_v1.htm) of a [SELECT list](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_v1.htm), namely:
    -   [field](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_field_v2.htm) of a data source
    -   [Input parameters](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_parameter_v1.htm) of the extended CDS view. It is not possible to specify new input parameters in a view extension.
    -   It can expose a [CDS association](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_association_v2.htm) of the extended view or a newly defined association
    -   Using a [path expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_path_expression_v1.htm), a field of an association target can be included. Path expressions are possible for associations of the extended view or for newly defined associations.
    -   [literals, session variables, expressions and functions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_operands_and_expr_v1.htm)
        
        Note: To add aggregate expressions to a view extension, special rules apply. See below.
        
-   Aggregate expressions are possible in the SELECT list of a view extension only if the following conditions are met:
    -   The original view must contain [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm). If the original view does not contain any aggregate expressions, this is not possible.
    -   The extended view must be annotated with AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory \[#PROJECTION\_LIST, #GROUP\_BY\]
    -   If non-aggregated elements are added to a CDS view with aggregate expressions, then the [GROUP-BY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_group_by_v1.htm) clause must be extended using the addition GROUP BY
-   If the original view contains [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm), equivalent UNION additions must be used in the statement EXTEND VIEW. As a prerequisite, the extended view must be annotated with AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory \[#PROJECTION\_LIST, #UNION\]
    
    If an appended element already occurs in the existing SELECT list or if a different extension occurs, it must be given an alternative element name using AS.
    

Restrictions

-   CDS views with an explicit [name list](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_name_list_v1.htm) cannot currently be extended.
-   CDS view extensions themselves cannot be extended.
-   It is not possible to specify new input parameters in a view extension.
-   No addition [ROOT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_define_root_view_v1.htm) can be specified in the statement EXTEND VIEW to transform a regular view to a [root entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenroot_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
-   An appended field cannot be defined as a key field using KEY.
-   It is not allowed to define new to-parent or composition associations in a view extension.
-   For views that have an element of data type LRAW or LCHR in the SELECT list, no view extension is possible and the annotation AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory\[#NONE\] is enforced. The reason is that elements of data types LRAW or LCHR must always be in the last position of the SELECT list.

Naming

Two repository objects are created for a CDS view extension that is defined using EXTEND VIEW. A name must be specified for each of the two objects:

-   The actual name cds\_view\_extension of the CDS view extension is specified after the keywords EXTEND VIEW. This name follows the same rules as the name of an [DDIC append view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_append_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), but can have up to 30 characters.
-   The name CDS\_APPEND\_VIEW for an [append view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_append_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in ABAP Dictionary must be specified in quotation marks after the annotation [@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm). This name is subject to the same rules as the name of a [DDIC database view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abendatabase_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in ABAP Dictionary, see topic [DDIC - Naming Rules for DDIC Views](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_view_names.htm). The new DDIC append view extends the [CDS-managed DDIC view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_mngdddic_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the extended CDS view. The name given to the DDIC append view can no longer be changed after the CDS view extension is transported into a follow-on system.

The name of the new DDIC append view and of the actual CDS view extension should be located in the customer namespace (or in the namespace of a partner or special development) to protect it against being overwritten by upgrades or new releases.

-   Once the DDL source code of a CDS view extension has been transported, the actual name cds\_view\_extension and the name of the DDIC append view CDS\_APPEND\_VIEW can no longer be changed. The extended view ddic\_based\_view can also no longer be changed.

Note: The DDL source code of a CDS view extension does not need to have the same name as the CDS view extension entity, but it is advisable to use the name of the entity.

Hints

-   Currently it is not possible to define extension categories for CDS views. The following restrictions apply for this reason:
    -   CDS views have the property can be extended in any way with respect to the [extension category of DDIC structures](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_structures_enh_cat.htm). The consequences of this must be respected when extending a CDS view.
    -   The attributes of a CDS view defined using [annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_anno_v1.htm), such as switching on [table buffering](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abentable_buffering_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), cannot currently be modified using extensions.
-   CDS view extensions specified with EXTEND ENTITY are recommended for CDS DDIC-based views only. However, for compatibility and migration reasons, it is also possible to extend [CDS projection views](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_projection_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or [CDS view entities](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_v2_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") with the statement EXTEND VIEW. However, view extends defined using EXTEND VIEW don't support the syntax elements specific to projection views and CDS view entities. Therefore, it is recommended to use the statement [EXTEND VIEW ENTITY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_extend_view_entity.htm) for extensions of CDS projection views and CDS view entities instead.
-   If, for some reason, a CDS projection view or a CDS view entity is extended with EXTEND VIEW, the [CDS-managed DDIC view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_mngdddic_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is deleted (as CDS projection views and CDS view entities do not have any DDIC artefacts), and entity annotations referring to the CDS-managed DDIC view are ignored.

Example

The following CDS view extension

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_EXTENS'
extend view demo\_cds\_original\_view with demo\_cds\_view\_extension  
  {
    spfli.distance,
    spfli.distid as unit
  };

adds two view fields to the existing CDS view

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_ORIG'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
@AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory: \[#PROJECTION\_LIST\]
@EndUserText.label: 'Further information about the CDS entity'
define view demo\_cds\_original\_view  
  as select from
           spfli
      join scarr on
        scarr.carrid = spfli.carrid
    {
      key scarr.carrname     as carrier,
      key spfli.connid       as flight,
          spfli.cityfrom     as departure,
          spfli.cityto       as destination
    }; .

The DDIC append view DEMO\_CDS\_EXTENS is created in ABAP Dictionary. The program DEMO\_CDS\_VIEW\_EXTENSION uses the statement [SELECT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abapselect.htm) to access the enhanced view and also displays the components of the dictionary structures in question.

Addition 1   

... GROUP BY field1, field2, ...

Effect

This addition must be specified if elements not defined using aggregate expressions are added to a view with [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm). These elements must be specified after GROUP BY add extend the [GROUP-BY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_group_by_v1.htm) clause of the original view. With respect to the extended view, the extended GROUP-BY clause must follow the general rules for a GROUP-BY clause.

The addition cannot be specified if the definition of the original view does not contain any aggregate expressions in its SELECT list.

Hint

Extensions of a view with aggregate expressions require it to contain the annotation array viewEnhancementCategory\[ \] with the value #GROUP\_BY.

Example

The following CDS view extension

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_EXTAGG'
extend view demo\_cds\_aggregate with demo\_cds\_extend\_aggregate
  {
    connid,  
    sum(distance) as sum\_distance
  }
  group by
    connid;

extends the existing CDS view

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_AGG'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
@AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory: \[#PROJECTION\_LIST,#GROUP\_BY\]
define view demo\_cds\_aggregate
  as select from
    spfli  
    {
      carrid,
      sum(fltime) as sum\_fltime
    }
    group by
      carrid; .

A database field connid and an aggregate expression sum(distance) are added to the SELECT list. Accordingly, the addition GROUP BY must be used to add the database field to the GROUP-BY clause of the original view.

Addition 2   

... UNION *\[*ALL*\]* { ... }

Effect

This addition must be specified when a view with [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm) clauses is extended. A corresponding UNION addition must be specified for each UNION clause of the original view. The addition ALL must be specified each time it is specified in the associated UNION clause of the original view. The curly brackets can contain elements that extend the SELECT list of the associated UNION clause of the original view. As specified by the SELECT list extended using select\_list\_extension, the UNION clauses must be extended so that the rules for UNION clauses are not broken in the extended view.

The addition cannot be specified if the definition of the original view does not have a UNION clause.

Hint

Extensions of a view with UNION clauses require it to contain the annotation array viewEnhancementCategory\[ \] with the value #UNION.

Example

The following CDS view extension

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_EXTUNI'
extend view demo\_cds\_union with demo\_cds\_extend\_union
  {
    c as c3,
    d as c4
  }
union
  {
    f as c3,
    g as c4
  }
union all
  {
    k as c3,
    l as c4
  };

extends the existing CDS view

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_UIO'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
@AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory: \[#PROJECTION\_LIST,#UNION\]
define view demo\_cds\_union
  as select from
    demo\_join1
    {
      a as c1,
      b as c2
    }
union select from
  demo\_join2
    {
      d as c1,
      e as c2
    }
union all select from
  demo\_join3
    {
      i as c1,
      j as c2
    }; .

The original view has two UNION clauses represented using corresponding UNION additions in the definition of the CDS view extension. Two elements with matching types are added to the three SELECT lists of the original view.

Effect

Specifies an [annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_syntax.htm) as an extension annotation in the definition of a [CDS view extension](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_extend_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") before the statement [EXTEND VIEW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_extend_view.htm). The character @ must be placed in front of the name annotation of the annotation. The annotation should be defined as a CDS object in a [CDS annotation definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_anno_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and the annotation definition annotation [@Scope](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_anno_annos.htm) should be specified here using the value #EXTEND\_VIEW.

The following tables show the possible [ABAP annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenabap_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that can be specified and their meanings. The ABAP annotations are evaluated by the ABAP runtime framework for every CDS entity. Annotations with other identifiers are usually [framework-specific annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_frmwrk.htm). These are not evaluated by the ABAP runtime framework but by other SAP frameworks instead.

The first column of the table shows the (possibly structured) name annotation of an ABAP annotation and the second column shows its meaning. The third column shows the possible [annotation values](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenannotation_value_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The fourth column shows the default value which is used if the annotation is not used at all. The fifth column shows the default value set implicitly for value in accordance with the [annotation definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_anno_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") if the annotation is specified without a value. If nothing is specified for the annotation value, the annotation should be specified without a value.

Effect

Extends an existing [CDS DDIC-based view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_v1_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") ddic\_based\_view using a [CDS view extension](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_extend_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") cds\_view\_extension in the [CDS DDL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_ddl_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). An existing CDS DDIC-based view can have one or more CDS view extensions.

The extended CDS view ddic\_based\_view must be specified under the name of its [CDS entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The name of the [CDS-managed DDIC view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_mngdddic_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") cannot be specified.

Prerequisite

As a prerequisite for the enhancement of the CDS view with the statement EXTEND VIEW, the elements of the [annotation array](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenannotation_array_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory\[ \]](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_anno_v1.htm) must be specified accordingly in its definition with [DEFINE VIEW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_define_view_v1.htm):

-   By default or if only the value #PROJECTION\_LIST is specified, views without [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm) in the SELECT list and without a [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm) clause can be extended.
-   In order to extend views that have [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm) in the SELECT list, the annotation array must contain the value #GROUP\_BY alongside #PROJECTION\_LIST.
-   In order to extend views that contain [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm) clauses, the annotation array must contain the value #UNION alongside #PROJECTION\_LIST.
-   If the annotation array contains the value #NONE, the view cannot be extended.

Components of a view extension

View extensions can make additions to the original view, but it can't modify, overwrite, or delete elements from the original view. The following components are possible in a CDS view extension:

-   The annotation [AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm) is mandatory. Further annotations [extension\_annot1](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm), [extension\_annot2](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm), ... can also be specified. This is optional.
-   New associations association1, association2 can be defined and exposed in the CDS view extension. The same rules apply that are described in topic [CDS DDL - DDIC-based view, ASSOCIATION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_simple_association_v1.htm).
    
    Note: It is not allowed to define new [CDS compositions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_composition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or [CDS to-parent associations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abento_parent_association_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in a view extension.
    
-   The elements of the extension list select\_list\_extension specified after EXTEND VIEW are added to the existing SELECT list. At least one element must be added. It is possible to access all fields of all data sources of the extended view in the extension list select\_list\_extension. The list can have all [elements](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_entry_v1.htm) of a [SELECT list](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_v1.htm), namely:
    -   [field](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_field_v2.htm) of a data source
    -   [Input parameters](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_parameter_v1.htm) of the extended CDS view. It is not possible to specify new input parameters in a view extension.
    -   It can expose a [CDS association](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_association_v2.htm) of the extended view or a newly defined association
    -   Using a [path expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_path_expression_v1.htm), a field of an association target can be included. Path expressions are possible for associations of the extended view or for newly defined associations.
    -   [literals, session variables, expressions and functions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_operands_and_expr_v1.htm)
        
        Note: To add aggregate expressions to a view extension, special rules apply. See below.
        
-   Aggregate expressions are possible in the SELECT list of a view extension only if the following conditions are met:
    -   The original view must contain [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm). If the original view does not contain any aggregate expressions, this is not possible.
    -   The extended view must be annotated with AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory \[#PROJECTION\_LIST, #GROUP\_BY\]
    -   If non-aggregated elements are added to a CDS view with aggregate expressions, then the [GROUP-BY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_group_by_v1.htm) clause must be extended using the addition GROUP BY
-   If the original view contains [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm), equivalent UNION additions must be used in the statement EXTEND VIEW. As a prerequisite, the extended view must be annotated with AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory \[#PROJECTION\_LIST, #UNION\]
    
    If an appended element already occurs in the existing SELECT list or if a different extension occurs, it must be given an alternative element name using AS.
    

Restrictions

-   CDS views with an explicit [name list](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_name_list_v1.htm) cannot currently be extended.
-   CDS view extensions themselves cannot be extended.
-   It is not possible to specify new input parameters in a view extension.
-   No addition [ROOT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_define_root_view_v1.htm) can be specified in the statement EXTEND VIEW to transform a regular view to a [root entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenroot_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
-   An appended field cannot be defined as a key field using KEY.
-   It is not allowed to define new to-parent or composition associations in a view extension.
-   For views that have an element of data type LRAW or LCHR in the SELECT list, no view extension is possible and the annotation AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory\[#NONE\] is enforced. The reason is that elements of data types LRAW or LCHR must always be in the last position of the SELECT list.

Naming

Two repository objects are created for a CDS view extension that is defined using EXTEND VIEW. A name must be specified for each of the two objects:

-   The actual name cds\_view\_extension of the CDS view extension is specified after the keywords EXTEND VIEW. This name follows the same rules as the name of an [DDIC append view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_append_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), but can have up to 30 characters.
-   The name CDS\_APPEND\_VIEW for an [append view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_append_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in ABAP Dictionary must be specified in quotation marks after the annotation [@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm). This name is subject to the same rules as the name of a [DDIC database view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abendatabase_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in ABAP Dictionary, see topic [DDIC - Naming Rules for DDIC Views](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_view_names.htm). The new DDIC append view extends the [CDS-managed DDIC view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_mngdddic_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the extended CDS view. The name given to the DDIC append view can no longer be changed after the CDS view extension is transported into a follow-on system.

The name of the new DDIC append view and of the actual CDS view extension should be located in the customer namespace (or in the namespace of a partner or special development) to protect it against being overwritten by upgrades or new releases.

-   Once the DDL source code of a CDS view extension has been transported, the actual name cds\_view\_extension and the name of the DDIC append view CDS\_APPEND\_VIEW can no longer be changed. The extended view ddic\_based\_view can also no longer be changed.

Note: The DDL source code of a CDS view extension does not need to have the same name as the CDS view extension entity, but it is advisable to use the name of the entity.

Hints

-   Currently it is not possible to define extension categories for CDS views. The following restrictions apply for this reason:
    -   CDS views have the property can be extended in any way with respect to the [extension category of DDIC structures](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_structures_enh_cat.htm). The consequences of this must be respected when extending a CDS view.
    -   The attributes of a CDS view defined using [annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_anno_v1.htm), such as switching on [table buffering](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abentable_buffering_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), cannot currently be modified using extensions.
-   CDS view extensions specified with EXTEND ENTITY are recommended for CDS DDIC-based views only. However, for compatibility and migration reasons, it is also possible to extend [CDS projection views](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_projection_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or [CDS view entities](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_v2_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") with the statement EXTEND VIEW. However, view extends defined using EXTEND VIEW don't support the syntax elements specific to projection views and CDS view entities. Therefore, it is recommended to use the statement [EXTEND VIEW ENTITY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_extend_view_entity.htm) for extensions of CDS projection views and CDS view entities instead.
-   If, for some reason, a CDS projection view or a CDS view entity is extended with EXTEND VIEW, the [CDS-managed DDIC view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_mngdddic_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is deleted (as CDS projection views and CDS view entities do not have any DDIC artefacts), and entity annotations referring to the CDS-managed DDIC view are ignored.

Example

The following CDS view extension

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_EXTENS'
extend view demo\_cds\_original\_view with demo\_cds\_view\_extension  
  {
    spfli.distance,
    spfli.distid as unit
  };

adds two view fields to the existing CDS view

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_ORIG'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
@AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory: \[#PROJECTION\_LIST\]
@EndUserText.label: 'Further information about the CDS entity'
define view demo\_cds\_original\_view  
  as select from
           spfli
      join scarr on
        scarr.carrid = spfli.carrid
    {
      key scarr.carrname     as carrier,
      key spfli.connid       as flight,
          spfli.cityfrom     as departure,
          spfli.cityto       as destination
    }; .

The DDIC append view DEMO\_CDS\_EXTENS is created in ABAP Dictionary. The program DEMO\_CDS\_VIEW\_EXTENSION uses the statement [SELECT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abapselect.htm) to access the enhanced view and also displays the components of the dictionary structures in question.

Addition 1   

... GROUP BY field1, field2, ...

Effect

This addition must be specified if elements not defined using aggregate expressions are added to a view with [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm). These elements must be specified after GROUP BY add extend the [GROUP-BY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_group_by_v1.htm) clause of the original view. With respect to the extended view, the extended GROUP-BY clause must follow the general rules for a GROUP-BY clause.

The addition cannot be specified if the definition of the original view does not contain any aggregate expressions in its SELECT list.

Hint

Extensions of a view with aggregate expressions require it to contain the annotation array viewEnhancementCategory\[ \] with the value #GROUP\_BY.

Example

The following CDS view extension

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_EXTAGG'
extend view demo\_cds\_aggregate with demo\_cds\_extend\_aggregate
  {
    connid,  
    sum(distance) as sum\_distance
  }
  group by
    connid;

extends the existing CDS view

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_AGG'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
@AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory: \[#PROJECTION\_LIST,#GROUP\_BY\]
define view demo\_cds\_aggregate
  as select from
    spfli  
    {
      carrid,
      sum(fltime) as sum\_fltime
    }
    group by
      carrid; .

A database field connid and an aggregate expression sum(distance) are added to the SELECT list. Accordingly, the addition GROUP BY must be used to add the database field to the GROUP-BY clause of the original view.

Addition 2   

... UNION *\[*ALL*\]* { ... }

Effect

This addition must be specified when a view with [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm) clauses is extended. A corresponding UNION addition must be specified for each UNION clause of the original view. The addition ALL must be specified each time it is specified in the associated UNION clause of the original view. The curly brackets can contain elements that extend the SELECT list of the associated UNION clause of the original view. As specified by the SELECT list extended using select\_list\_extension, the UNION clauses must be extended so that the rules for UNION clauses are not broken in the extended view.

The addition cannot be specified if the definition of the original view does not have a UNION clause.

Hint

Extensions of a view with UNION clauses require it to contain the annotation array viewEnhancementCategory\[ \] with the value #UNION.

Example

The following CDS view extension

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_EXTUNI'
extend view demo\_cds\_union with demo\_cds\_extend\_union
  {
    c as c3,
    d as c4
  }
union
  {
    f as c3,
    g as c4
  }
union all
  {
    k as c3,
    l as c4
  };

extends the existing CDS view

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_UIO'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
@AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory: \[#PROJECTION\_LIST,#UNION\]
define view demo\_cds\_union
  as select from
    demo\_join1
    {
      a as c1,
      b as c2
    }
union select from
  demo\_join2
    {
      d as c1,
      e as c2
    }
union all select from
  demo\_join3
    {
      i as c1,
      j as c2
    }; .

The original view has two UNION clauses represented using corresponding UNION additions in the definition of the CDS view extension. Two elements with matching types are added to the three SELECT lists of the original view.

Effect

Specifies an [annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_syntax.htm) as an extension annotation in the definition of a [CDS view extension](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_extend_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") before the statement [EXTEND VIEW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_extend_view.htm). The character @ must be placed in front of the name annotation of the annotation. The annotation should be defined as a CDS object in a [CDS annotation definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_anno_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and the annotation definition annotation [@Scope](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_anno_annos.htm) should be specified here using the value #EXTEND\_VIEW.

The following tables show the possible [ABAP annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenabap_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that can be specified and their meanings. The ABAP annotations are evaluated by the ABAP runtime framework for every CDS entity. Annotations with other identifiers are usually [framework-specific annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_frmwrk.htm). These are not evaluated by the ABAP runtime framework but by other SAP frameworks instead.

The first column of the table shows the (possibly structured) name annotation of an ABAP annotation and the second column shows its meaning. The third column shows the possible [annotation values](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenannotation_value_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The fourth column shows the default value which is used if the annotation is not used at all. The fifth column shows the default value set implicitly for value in accordance with the [annotation definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_anno_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") if the annotation is specified without a value. If nothing is specified for the annotation value, the annotation should be specified without a value.

Effect

Extends an existing [CDS DDIC-based view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_v1_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") ddic\_based\_view using a [CDS view extension](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_extend_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") cds\_view\_extension in the [CDS DDL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_ddl_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). An existing CDS DDIC-based view can have one or more CDS view extensions.

The extended CDS view ddic\_based\_view must be specified under the name of its [CDS entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The name of the [CDS-managed DDIC view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_mngdddic_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") cannot be specified.

Prerequisite

As a prerequisite for the enhancement of the CDS view with the statement EXTEND VIEW, the elements of the [annotation array](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenannotation_array_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory\[ \]](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_anno_v1.htm) must be specified accordingly in its definition with [DEFINE VIEW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_define_view_v1.htm):

-   By default or if only the value #PROJECTION\_LIST is specified, views without [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm) in the SELECT list and without a [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm) clause can be extended.
-   In order to extend views that have [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm) in the SELECT list, the annotation array must contain the value #GROUP\_BY alongside #PROJECTION\_LIST.
-   In order to extend views that contain [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm) clauses, the annotation array must contain the value #UNION alongside #PROJECTION\_LIST.
-   If the annotation array contains the value #NONE, the view cannot be extended.

Components of a view extension

View extensions can make additions to the original view, but it can't modify, overwrite, or delete elements from the original view. The following components are possible in a CDS view extension:

-   The annotation [AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm) is mandatory. Further annotations [extension\_annot1](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm), [extension\_annot2](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm), ... can also be specified. This is optional.
-   New associations association1, association2 can be defined and exposed in the CDS view extension. The same rules apply that are described in topic [CDS DDL - DDIC-based view, ASSOCIATION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_simple_association_v1.htm).
    
    Note: It is not allowed to define new [CDS compositions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_composition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or [CDS to-parent associations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abento_parent_association_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in a view extension.
    
-   The elements of the extension list select\_list\_extension specified after EXTEND VIEW are added to the existing SELECT list. At least one element must be added. It is possible to access all fields of all data sources of the extended view in the extension list select\_list\_extension. The list can have all [elements](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_entry_v1.htm) of a [SELECT list](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_v1.htm), namely:
    -   [field](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_field_v2.htm) of a data source
    -   [Input parameters](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_parameter_v1.htm) of the extended CDS view. It is not possible to specify new input parameters in a view extension.
    -   It can expose a [CDS association](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_association_v2.htm) of the extended view or a newly defined association
    -   Using a [path expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_path_expression_v1.htm), a field of an association target can be included. Path expressions are possible for associations of the extended view or for newly defined associations.
    -   [literals, session variables, expressions and functions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_operands_and_expr_v1.htm)
        
        Note: To add aggregate expressions to a view extension, special rules apply. See below.
        
-   Aggregate expressions are possible in the SELECT list of a view extension only if the following conditions are met:
    -   The original view must contain [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm). If the original view does not contain any aggregate expressions, this is not possible.
    -   The extended view must be annotated with AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory \[#PROJECTION\_LIST, #GROUP\_BY\]
    -   If non-aggregated elements are added to a CDS view with aggregate expressions, then the [GROUP-BY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_group_by_v1.htm) clause must be extended using the addition GROUP BY
-   If the original view contains [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm), equivalent UNION additions must be used in the statement EXTEND VIEW. As a prerequisite, the extended view must be annotated with AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory \[#PROJECTION\_LIST, #UNION\]
    
    If an appended element already occurs in the existing SELECT list or if a different extension occurs, it must be given an alternative element name using AS.
    

Restrictions

-   CDS views with an explicit [name list](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_name_list_v1.htm) cannot currently be extended.
-   CDS view extensions themselves cannot be extended.
-   It is not possible to specify new input parameters in a view extension.
-   No addition [ROOT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_define_root_view_v1.htm) can be specified in the statement EXTEND VIEW to transform a regular view to a [root entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenroot_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
-   An appended field cannot be defined as a key field using KEY.
-   It is not allowed to define new to-parent or composition associations in a view extension.
-   For views that have an element of data type LRAW or LCHR in the SELECT list, no view extension is possible and the annotation AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory\[#NONE\] is enforced. The reason is that elements of data types LRAW or LCHR must always be in the last position of the SELECT list.

Naming

Two repository objects are created for a CDS view extension that is defined using EXTEND VIEW. A name must be specified for each of the two objects:

-   The actual name cds\_view\_extension of the CDS view extension is specified after the keywords EXTEND VIEW. This name follows the same rules as the name of an [DDIC append view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_append_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), but can have up to 30 characters.
-   The name CDS\_APPEND\_VIEW for an [append view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_append_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in ABAP Dictionary must be specified in quotation marks after the annotation [@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm). This name is subject to the same rules as the name of a [DDIC database view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abendatabase_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in ABAP Dictionary, see topic [DDIC - Naming Rules for DDIC Views](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_view_names.htm). The new DDIC append view extends the [CDS-managed DDIC view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_mngdddic_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the extended CDS view. The name given to the DDIC append view can no longer be changed after the CDS view extension is transported into a follow-on system.

The name of the new DDIC append view and of the actual CDS view extension should be located in the customer namespace (or in the namespace of a partner or special development) to protect it against being overwritten by upgrades or new releases.

-   Once the DDL source code of a CDS view extension has been transported, the actual name cds\_view\_extension and the name of the DDIC append view CDS\_APPEND\_VIEW can no longer be changed. The extended view ddic\_based\_view can also no longer be changed.

Note: The DDL source code of a CDS view extension does not need to have the same name as the CDS view extension entity, but it is advisable to use the name of the entity.

Hints

-   Currently it is not possible to define extension categories for CDS views. The following restrictions apply for this reason:
    -   CDS views have the property can be extended in any way with respect to the [extension category of DDIC structures](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_structures_enh_cat.htm). The consequences of this must be respected when extending a CDS view.
    -   The attributes of a CDS view defined using [annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_anno_v1.htm), such as switching on [table buffering](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abentable_buffering_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), cannot currently be modified using extensions.
-   CDS view extensions specified with EXTEND ENTITY are recommended for CDS DDIC-based views only. However, for compatibility and migration reasons, it is also possible to extend [CDS projection views](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_projection_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or [CDS view entities](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_v2_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") with the statement EXTEND VIEW. However, view extends defined using EXTEND VIEW don't support the syntax elements specific to projection views and CDS view entities. Therefore, it is recommended to use the statement [EXTEND VIEW ENTITY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_extend_view_entity.htm) for extensions of CDS projection views and CDS view entities instead.
-   If, for some reason, a CDS projection view or a CDS view entity is extended with EXTEND VIEW, the [CDS-managed DDIC view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_mngdddic_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is deleted (as CDS projection views and CDS view entities do not have any DDIC artefacts), and entity annotations referring to the CDS-managed DDIC view are ignored.

Example

The following CDS view extension

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_EXTENS'
extend view demo\_cds\_original\_view with demo\_cds\_view\_extension  
  {
    spfli.distance,
    spfli.distid as unit
  };

adds two view fields to the existing CDS view

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_ORIG'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
@AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory: \[#PROJECTION\_LIST\]
@EndUserText.label: 'Further information about the CDS entity'
define view demo\_cds\_original\_view  
  as select from
           spfli
      join scarr on
        scarr.carrid = spfli.carrid
    {
      key scarr.carrname     as carrier,
      key spfli.connid       as flight,
          spfli.cityfrom     as departure,
          spfli.cityto       as destination
    }; .

The DDIC append view DEMO\_CDS\_EXTENS is created in ABAP Dictionary. The program DEMO\_CDS\_VIEW\_EXTENSION uses the statement [SELECT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abapselect.htm) to access the enhanced view and also displays the components of the dictionary structures in question.

Addition 1   

... GROUP BY field1, field2, ...

Effect

This addition must be specified if elements not defined using aggregate expressions are added to a view with [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm). These elements must be specified after GROUP BY add extend the [GROUP-BY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_group_by_v1.htm) clause of the original view. With respect to the extended view, the extended GROUP-BY clause must follow the general rules for a GROUP-BY clause.

The addition cannot be specified if the definition of the original view does not contain any aggregate expressions in its SELECT list.

Hint

Extensions of a view with aggregate expressions require it to contain the annotation array viewEnhancementCategory\[ \] with the value #GROUP\_BY.

Example

The following CDS view extension

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_EXTAGG'
extend view demo\_cds\_aggregate with demo\_cds\_extend\_aggregate
  {
    connid,  
    sum(distance) as sum\_distance
  }
  group by
    connid;

extends the existing CDS view

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_AGG'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
@AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory: \[#PROJECTION\_LIST,#GROUP\_BY\]
define view demo\_cds\_aggregate
  as select from
    spfli  
    {
      carrid,
      sum(fltime) as sum\_fltime
    }
    group by
      carrid; .

A database field connid and an aggregate expression sum(distance) are added to the SELECT list. Accordingly, the addition GROUP BY must be used to add the database field to the GROUP-BY clause of the original view.

Addition 2   

... UNION *\[*ALL*\]* { ... }

Effect

This addition must be specified when a view with [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm) clauses is extended. A corresponding UNION addition must be specified for each UNION clause of the original view. The addition ALL must be specified each time it is specified in the associated UNION clause of the original view. The curly brackets can contain elements that extend the SELECT list of the associated UNION clause of the original view. As specified by the SELECT list extended using select\_list\_extension, the UNION clauses must be extended so that the rules for UNION clauses are not broken in the extended view.

The addition cannot be specified if the definition of the original view does not have a UNION clause.

Hint

Extensions of a view with UNION clauses require it to contain the annotation array viewEnhancementCategory\[ \] with the value #UNION.

Example

The following CDS view extension

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_EXTUNI'
extend view demo\_cds\_union with demo\_cds\_extend\_union
  {
    c as c3,
    d as c4
  }
union
  {
    f as c3,
    g as c4
  }
union all
  {
    k as c3,
    l as c4
  };

extends the existing CDS view

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_UIO'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
@AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory: \[#PROJECTION\_LIST,#UNION\]
define view demo\_cds\_union
  as select from
    demo\_join1
    {
      a as c1,
      b as c2
    }
union select from
  demo\_join2
    {
      d as c1,
      e as c2
    }
union all select from
  demo\_join3
    {
      i as c1,
      j as c2
    }; .

The original view has two UNION clauses represented using corresponding UNION additions in the definition of the CDS view extension. Two elements with matching types are added to the three SELECT lists of the original view.

Effect

Specifies an [annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_syntax.htm) as an extension annotation in the definition of a [CDS view extension](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_extend_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") before the statement [EXTEND VIEW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_extend_view.htm). The character @ must be placed in front of the name annotation of the annotation. The annotation should be defined as a CDS object in a [CDS annotation definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_anno_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and the annotation definition annotation [@Scope](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_anno_annos.htm) should be specified here using the value #EXTEND\_VIEW.

The following tables show the possible [ABAP annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenabap_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that can be specified and their meanings. The ABAP annotations are evaluated by the ABAP runtime framework for every CDS entity. Annotations with other identifiers are usually [framework-specific annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_frmwrk.htm). These are not evaluated by the ABAP runtime framework but by other SAP frameworks instead.

The first column of the table shows the (possibly structured) name annotation of an ABAP annotation and the second column shows its meaning. The third column shows the possible [annotation values](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenannotation_value_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The fourth column shows the default value which is used if the annotation is not used at all. The fifth column shows the default value set implicitly for value in accordance with the [annotation definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_anno_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") if the annotation is specified without a value. If nothing is specified for the annotation value, the annotation should be specified without a value.

Effect

Extends an existing [CDS DDIC-based view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_v1_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") ddic\_based\_view using a [CDS view extension](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_extend_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") cds\_view\_extension in the [CDS DDL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_ddl_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). An existing CDS DDIC-based view can have one or more CDS view extensions.

The extended CDS view ddic\_based\_view must be specified under the name of its [CDS entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The name of the [CDS-managed DDIC view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_mngdddic_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") cannot be specified.

Prerequisite

As a prerequisite for the enhancement of the CDS view with the statement EXTEND VIEW, the elements of the [annotation array](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenannotation_array_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory\[ \]](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_anno_v1.htm) must be specified accordingly in its definition with [DEFINE VIEW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_define_view_v1.htm):

-   By default or if only the value #PROJECTION\_LIST is specified, views without [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm) in the SELECT list and without a [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm) clause can be extended.
-   In order to extend views that have [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm) in the SELECT list, the annotation array must contain the value #GROUP\_BY alongside #PROJECTION\_LIST.
-   In order to extend views that contain [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm) clauses, the annotation array must contain the value #UNION alongside #PROJECTION\_LIST.
-   If the annotation array contains the value #NONE, the view cannot be extended.

Components of a view extension

View extensions can make additions to the original view, but it can't modify, overwrite, or delete elements from the original view. The following components are possible in a CDS view extension:

-   The annotation [AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm) is mandatory. Further annotations [extension\_annot1](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm), [extension\_annot2](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm), ... can also be specified. This is optional.
-   New associations association1, association2 can be defined and exposed in the CDS view extension. The same rules apply that are described in topic [CDS DDL - DDIC-based view, ASSOCIATION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_simple_association_v1.htm).
    
    Note: It is not allowed to define new [CDS compositions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_composition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or [CDS to-parent associations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abento_parent_association_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in a view extension.
    
-   The elements of the extension list select\_list\_extension specified after EXTEND VIEW are added to the existing SELECT list. At least one element must be added. It is possible to access all fields of all data sources of the extended view in the extension list select\_list\_extension. The list can have all [elements](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_entry_v1.htm) of a [SELECT list](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_v1.htm), namely:
    -   [field](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_field_v2.htm) of a data source
    -   [Input parameters](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_parameter_v1.htm) of the extended CDS view. It is not possible to specify new input parameters in a view extension.
    -   It can expose a [CDS association](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_association_v2.htm) of the extended view or a newly defined association
    -   Using a [path expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_path_expression_v1.htm), a field of an association target can be included. Path expressions are possible for associations of the extended view or for newly defined associations.
    -   [literals, session variables, expressions and functions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_operands_and_expr_v1.htm)
        
        Note: To add aggregate expressions to a view extension, special rules apply. See below.
        
-   Aggregate expressions are possible in the SELECT list of a view extension only if the following conditions are met:
    -   The original view must contain [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm). If the original view does not contain any aggregate expressions, this is not possible.
    -   The extended view must be annotated with AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory \[#PROJECTION\_LIST, #GROUP\_BY\]
    -   If non-aggregated elements are added to a CDS view with aggregate expressions, then the [GROUP-BY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_group_by_v1.htm) clause must be extended using the addition GROUP BY
-   If the original view contains [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm), equivalent UNION additions must be used in the statement EXTEND VIEW. As a prerequisite, the extended view must be annotated with AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory \[#PROJECTION\_LIST, #UNION\]
    
    If an appended element already occurs in the existing SELECT list or if a different extension occurs, it must be given an alternative element name using AS.
    

Restrictions

-   CDS views with an explicit [name list](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_name_list_v1.htm) cannot currently be extended.
-   CDS view extensions themselves cannot be extended.
-   It is not possible to specify new input parameters in a view extension.
-   No addition [ROOT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_define_root_view_v1.htm) can be specified in the statement EXTEND VIEW to transform a regular view to a [root entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenroot_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
-   An appended field cannot be defined as a key field using KEY.
-   It is not allowed to define new to-parent or composition associations in a view extension.
-   For views that have an element of data type LRAW or LCHR in the SELECT list, no view extension is possible and the annotation AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory\[#NONE\] is enforced. The reason is that elements of data types LRAW or LCHR must always be in the last position of the SELECT list.

Naming

Two repository objects are created for a CDS view extension that is defined using EXTEND VIEW. A name must be specified for each of the two objects:

-   The actual name cds\_view\_extension of the CDS view extension is specified after the keywords EXTEND VIEW. This name follows the same rules as the name of an [DDIC append view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_append_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), but can have up to 30 characters.
-   The name CDS\_APPEND\_VIEW for an [append view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_append_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in ABAP Dictionary must be specified in quotation marks after the annotation [@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm). This name is subject to the same rules as the name of a [DDIC database view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abendatabase_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in ABAP Dictionary, see topic [DDIC - Naming Rules for DDIC Views](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_view_names.htm). The new DDIC append view extends the [CDS-managed DDIC view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_mngdddic_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the extended CDS view. The name given to the DDIC append view can no longer be changed after the CDS view extension is transported into a follow-on system.

The name of the new DDIC append view and of the actual CDS view extension should be located in the customer namespace (or in the namespace of a partner or special development) to protect it against being overwritten by upgrades or new releases.

-   Once the DDL source code of a CDS view extension has been transported, the actual name cds\_view\_extension and the name of the DDIC append view CDS\_APPEND\_VIEW can no longer be changed. The extended view ddic\_based\_view can also no longer be changed.

Note: The DDL source code of a CDS view extension does not need to have the same name as the CDS view extension entity, but it is advisable to use the name of the entity.

Hints

-   Currently it is not possible to define extension categories for CDS views. The following restrictions apply for this reason:
    -   CDS views have the property can be extended in any way with respect to the [extension category of DDIC structures](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_structures_enh_cat.htm). The consequences of this must be respected when extending a CDS view.
    -   The attributes of a CDS view defined using [annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_anno_v1.htm), such as switching on [table buffering](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abentable_buffering_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), cannot currently be modified using extensions.
-   CDS view extensions specified with EXTEND ENTITY are recommended for CDS DDIC-based views only. However, for compatibility and migration reasons, it is also possible to extend [CDS projection views](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_projection_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or [CDS view entities](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_v2_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") with the statement EXTEND VIEW. However, view extends defined using EXTEND VIEW don't support the syntax elements specific to projection views and CDS view entities. Therefore, it is recommended to use the statement [EXTEND VIEW ENTITY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_extend_view_entity.htm) for extensions of CDS projection views and CDS view entities instead.
-   If, for some reason, a CDS projection view or a CDS view entity is extended with EXTEND VIEW, the [CDS-managed DDIC view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_mngdddic_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is deleted (as CDS projection views and CDS view entities do not have any DDIC artefacts), and entity annotations referring to the CDS-managed DDIC view are ignored.

Example

The following CDS view extension

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_EXTENS'
extend view demo\_cds\_original\_view with demo\_cds\_view\_extension  
  {
    spfli.distance,
    spfli.distid as unit
  };

adds two view fields to the existing CDS view

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_ORIG'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
@AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory: \[#PROJECTION\_LIST\]
@EndUserText.label: 'Further information about the CDS entity'
define view demo\_cds\_original\_view  
  as select from
           spfli
      join scarr on
        scarr.carrid = spfli.carrid
    {
      key scarr.carrname     as carrier,
      key spfli.connid       as flight,
          spfli.cityfrom     as departure,
          spfli.cityto       as destination
    }; .

The DDIC append view DEMO\_CDS\_EXTENS is created in ABAP Dictionary. The program DEMO\_CDS\_VIEW\_EXTENSION uses the statement [SELECT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abapselect.htm) to access the enhanced view and also displays the components of the dictionary structures in question.

Addition 1   

... GROUP BY field1, field2, ...

Effect

This addition must be specified if elements not defined using aggregate expressions are added to a view with [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm). These elements must be specified after GROUP BY add extend the [GROUP-BY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_group_by_v1.htm) clause of the original view. With respect to the extended view, the extended GROUP-BY clause must follow the general rules for a GROUP-BY clause.

The addition cannot be specified if the definition of the original view does not contain any aggregate expressions in its SELECT list.

Hint

Extensions of a view with aggregate expressions require it to contain the annotation array viewEnhancementCategory\[ \] with the value #GROUP\_BY.

Example

The following CDS view extension

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_EXTAGG'
extend view demo\_cds\_aggregate with demo\_cds\_extend\_aggregate
  {
    connid,  
    sum(distance) as sum\_distance
  }
  group by
    connid;

extends the existing CDS view

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_AGG'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
@AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory: \[#PROJECTION\_LIST,#GROUP\_BY\]
define view demo\_cds\_aggregate
  as select from
    spfli  
    {
      carrid,
      sum(fltime) as sum\_fltime
    }
    group by
      carrid; .

A database field connid and an aggregate expression sum(distance) are added to the SELECT list. Accordingly, the addition GROUP BY must be used to add the database field to the GROUP-BY clause of the original view.

Addition 2   

... UNION *\[*ALL*\]* { ... }

Effect

This addition must be specified when a view with [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm) clauses is extended. A corresponding UNION addition must be specified for each UNION clause of the original view. The addition ALL must be specified each time it is specified in the associated UNION clause of the original view. The curly brackets can contain elements that extend the SELECT list of the associated UNION clause of the original view. As specified by the SELECT list extended using select\_list\_extension, the UNION clauses must be extended so that the rules for UNION clauses are not broken in the extended view.

The addition cannot be specified if the definition of the original view does not have a UNION clause.

Hint

Extensions of a view with UNION clauses require it to contain the annotation array viewEnhancementCategory\[ \] with the value #UNION.

Example

The following CDS view extension

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_EXTUNI'
extend view demo\_cds\_union with demo\_cds\_extend\_union
  {
    c as c3,
    d as c4
  }
union
  {
    f as c3,
    g as c4
  }
union all
  {
    k as c3,
    l as c4
  };

extends the existing CDS view

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_UIO'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
@AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory: \[#PROJECTION\_LIST,#UNION\]
define view demo\_cds\_union
  as select from
    demo\_join1
    {
      a as c1,
      b as c2
    }
union select from
  demo\_join2
    {
      d as c1,
      e as c2
    }
union all select from
  demo\_join3
    {
      i as c1,
      j as c2
    }; .

The original view has two UNION clauses represented using corresponding UNION additions in the definition of the CDS view extension. Two elements with matching types are added to the three SELECT lists of the original view.

Syntax

... @[annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_syntax.htm) ...

Effect

Specifies an [annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_syntax.htm) as an extension annotation in the definition of a [CDS view extension](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_extend_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") before the statement [EXTEND VIEW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_extend_view.htm). The character @ must be placed in front of the name annotation of the annotation. The annotation should be defined as a CDS object in a [CDS annotation definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_anno_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and the annotation definition annotation [@Scope](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_anno_annos.htm) should be specified here using the value #EXTEND\_VIEW.

The following tables show the possible [ABAP annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenabap_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that can be specified and their meanings. The ABAP annotations are evaluated by the ABAP runtime framework for every CDS entity. Annotations with other identifiers are usually [framework-specific annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_frmwrk.htm). These are not evaluated by the ABAP runtime framework but by other SAP frameworks instead.

The first column of the table shows the (possibly structured) name annotation of an ABAP annotation and the second column shows its meaning. The third column shows the possible [annotation values](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenannotation_value_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The fourth column shows the default value which is used if the annotation is not used at all. The fifth column shows the default value set implicitly for value in accordance with the [annotation definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_anno_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") if the annotation is specified without a value. If nothing is specified for the annotation value, the annotation should be specified without a value.

Hints

-   Each definition of a CDS view extension must contain the ABAP annotation AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName that defines the name of the DDIC append view in ABAP Dictionary.
-   The name given to the DDIC append view can no longer be changed after the CDS view extension is transported into a follow-on system.

Effect

Extends an existing [CDS DDIC-based view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_v1_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") ddic\_based\_view using a [CDS view extension](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_extend_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") cds\_view\_extension in the [CDS DDL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_ddl_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). An existing CDS DDIC-based view can have one or more CDS view extensions.

The extended CDS view ddic\_based\_view must be specified under the name of its [CDS entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The name of the [CDS-managed DDIC view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_mngdddic_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") cannot be specified.

Prerequisite

As a prerequisite for the enhancement of the CDS view with the statement EXTEND VIEW, the elements of the [annotation array](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenannotation_array_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory\[ \]](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_anno_v1.htm) must be specified accordingly in its definition with [DEFINE VIEW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_define_view_v1.htm):

-   By default or if only the value #PROJECTION\_LIST is specified, views without [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm) in the SELECT list and without a [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm) clause can be extended.
-   In order to extend views that have [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm) in the SELECT list, the annotation array must contain the value #GROUP\_BY alongside #PROJECTION\_LIST.
-   In order to extend views that contain [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm) clauses, the annotation array must contain the value #UNION alongside #PROJECTION\_LIST.
-   If the annotation array contains the value #NONE, the view cannot be extended.

Components of a view extension

View extensions can make additions to the original view, but it can't modify, overwrite, or delete elements from the original view. The following components are possible in a CDS view extension:

-   The annotation [AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm) is mandatory. Further annotations [extension\_annot1](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm), [extension\_annot2](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm), ... can also be specified. This is optional.
-   New associations association1, association2 can be defined and exposed in the CDS view extension. The same rules apply that are described in topic [CDS DDL - DDIC-based view, ASSOCIATION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_simple_association_v1.htm).
    
    Note: It is not allowed to define new [CDS compositions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_composition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or [CDS to-parent associations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abento_parent_association_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in a view extension.
    
-   The elements of the extension list select\_list\_extension specified after EXTEND VIEW are added to the existing SELECT list. At least one element must be added. It is possible to access all fields of all data sources of the extended view in the extension list select\_list\_extension. The list can have all [elements](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_entry_v1.htm) of a [SELECT list](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_v1.htm), namely:
    -   [field](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_field_v2.htm) of a data source
    -   [Input parameters](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_parameter_v1.htm) of the extended CDS view. It is not possible to specify new input parameters in a view extension.
    -   It can expose a [CDS association](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_association_v2.htm) of the extended view or a newly defined association
    -   Using a [path expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_path_expression_v1.htm), a field of an association target can be included. Path expressions are possible for associations of the extended view or for newly defined associations.
    -   [literals, session variables, expressions and functions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_operands_and_expr_v1.htm)
        
        Note: To add aggregate expressions to a view extension, special rules apply. See below.
        
-   Aggregate expressions are possible in the SELECT list of a view extension only if the following conditions are met:
    -   The original view must contain [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm). If the original view does not contain any aggregate expressions, this is not possible.
    -   The extended view must be annotated with AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory \[#PROJECTION\_LIST, #GROUP\_BY\]
    -   If non-aggregated elements are added to a CDS view with aggregate expressions, then the [GROUP-BY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_group_by_v1.htm) clause must be extended using the addition GROUP BY
-   If the original view contains [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm), equivalent UNION additions must be used in the statement EXTEND VIEW. As a prerequisite, the extended view must be annotated with AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory \[#PROJECTION\_LIST, #UNION\]
    
    If an appended element already occurs in the existing SELECT list or if a different extension occurs, it must be given an alternative element name using AS.
    

Restrictions

-   CDS views with an explicit [name list](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_name_list_v1.htm) cannot currently be extended.
-   CDS view extensions themselves cannot be extended.
-   It is not possible to specify new input parameters in a view extension.
-   No addition [ROOT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_define_root_view_v1.htm) can be specified in the statement EXTEND VIEW to transform a regular view to a [root entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenroot_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
-   An appended field cannot be defined as a key field using KEY.
-   It is not allowed to define new to-parent or composition associations in a view extension.
-   For views that have an element of data type LRAW or LCHR in the SELECT list, no view extension is possible and the annotation AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory\[#NONE\] is enforced. The reason is that elements of data types LRAW or LCHR must always be in the last position of the SELECT list.

Naming

Two repository objects are created for a CDS view extension that is defined using EXTEND VIEW. A name must be specified for each of the two objects:

-   The actual name cds\_view\_extension of the CDS view extension is specified after the keywords EXTEND VIEW. This name follows the same rules as the name of an [DDIC append view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_append_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), but can have up to 30 characters.
-   The name CDS\_APPEND\_VIEW for an [append view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_append_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in ABAP Dictionary must be specified in quotation marks after the annotation [@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm). This name is subject to the same rules as the name of a [DDIC database view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abendatabase_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in ABAP Dictionary, see topic [DDIC - Naming Rules for DDIC Views](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_view_names.htm). The new DDIC append view extends the [CDS-managed DDIC view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_mngdddic_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the extended CDS view. The name given to the DDIC append view can no longer be changed after the CDS view extension is transported into a follow-on system.

The name of the new DDIC append view and of the actual CDS view extension should be located in the customer namespace (or in the namespace of a partner or special development) to protect it against being overwritten by upgrades or new releases.

-   Once the DDL source code of a CDS view extension has been transported, the actual name cds\_view\_extension and the name of the DDIC append view CDS\_APPEND\_VIEW can no longer be changed. The extended view ddic\_based\_view can also no longer be changed.

Note: The DDL source code of a CDS view extension does not need to have the same name as the CDS view extension entity, but it is advisable to use the name of the entity.

Hints

-   Currently it is not possible to define extension categories for CDS views. The following restrictions apply for this reason:
    -   CDS views have the property can be extended in any way with respect to the [extension category of DDIC structures](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_structures_enh_cat.htm). The consequences of this must be respected when extending a CDS view.
    -   The attributes of a CDS view defined using [annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_anno_v1.htm), such as switching on [table buffering](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abentable_buffering_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), cannot currently be modified using extensions.
-   CDS view extensions specified with EXTEND ENTITY are recommended for CDS DDIC-based views only. However, for compatibility and migration reasons, it is also possible to extend [CDS projection views](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_projection_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or [CDS view entities](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_v2_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") with the statement EXTEND VIEW. However, view extends defined using EXTEND VIEW don't support the syntax elements specific to projection views and CDS view entities. Therefore, it is recommended to use the statement [EXTEND VIEW ENTITY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_extend_view_entity.htm) for extensions of CDS projection views and CDS view entities instead.
-   If, for some reason, a CDS projection view or a CDS view entity is extended with EXTEND VIEW, the [CDS-managed DDIC view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_mngdddic_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is deleted (as CDS projection views and CDS view entities do not have any DDIC artefacts), and entity annotations referring to the CDS-managed DDIC view are ignored.

Example

The following CDS view extension

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_EXTENS'
extend view demo\_cds\_original\_view with demo\_cds\_view\_extension  
  {
    spfli.distance,
    spfli.distid as unit
  };

adds two view fields to the existing CDS view

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_ORIG'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
@AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory: \[#PROJECTION\_LIST\]
@EndUserText.label: 'Further information about the CDS entity'
define view demo\_cds\_original\_view  
  as select from
           spfli
      join scarr on
        scarr.carrid = spfli.carrid
    {
      key scarr.carrname     as carrier,
      key spfli.connid       as flight,
          spfli.cityfrom     as departure,
          spfli.cityto       as destination
    }; .

The DDIC append view DEMO\_CDS\_EXTENS is created in ABAP Dictionary. The program DEMO\_CDS\_VIEW\_EXTENSION uses the statement [SELECT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abapselect.htm) to access the enhanced view and also displays the components of the dictionary structures in question.

Addition 1   

... GROUP BY field1, field2, ...

Effect

This addition must be specified if elements not defined using aggregate expressions are added to a view with [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm). These elements must be specified after GROUP BY add extend the [GROUP-BY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_group_by_v1.htm) clause of the original view. With respect to the extended view, the extended GROUP-BY clause must follow the general rules for a GROUP-BY clause.

The addition cannot be specified if the definition of the original view does not contain any aggregate expressions in its SELECT list.

Hint

Extensions of a view with aggregate expressions require it to contain the annotation array viewEnhancementCategory\[ \] with the value #GROUP\_BY.

Example

The following CDS view extension

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_EXTAGG'
extend view demo\_cds\_aggregate with demo\_cds\_extend\_aggregate
  {
    connid,  
    sum(distance) as sum\_distance
  }
  group by
    connid;

extends the existing CDS view

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_AGG'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
@AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory: \[#PROJECTION\_LIST,#GROUP\_BY\]
define view demo\_cds\_aggregate
  as select from
    spfli  
    {
      carrid,
      sum(fltime) as sum\_fltime
    }
    group by
      carrid; .

A database field connid and an aggregate expression sum(distance) are added to the SELECT list. Accordingly, the addition GROUP BY must be used to add the database field to the GROUP-BY clause of the original view.

Addition 2   

... UNION *\[*ALL*\]* { ... }

Effect

This addition must be specified when a view with [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm) clauses is extended. A corresponding UNION addition must be specified for each UNION clause of the original view. The addition ALL must be specified each time it is specified in the associated UNION clause of the original view. The curly brackets can contain elements that extend the SELECT list of the associated UNION clause of the original view. As specified by the SELECT list extended using select\_list\_extension, the UNION clauses must be extended so that the rules for UNION clauses are not broken in the extended view.

The addition cannot be specified if the definition of the original view does not have a UNION clause.

Hint

Extensions of a view with UNION clauses require it to contain the annotation array viewEnhancementCategory\[ \] with the value #UNION.

Example

The following CDS view extension

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_EXTUNI'
extend view demo\_cds\_union with demo\_cds\_extend\_union
  {
    c as c3,
    d as c4
  }
union
  {
    f as c3,
    g as c4
  }
union all
  {
    k as c3,
    l as c4
  };

extends the existing CDS view

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_UIO'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
@AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory: \[#PROJECTION\_LIST,#UNION\]
define view demo\_cds\_union
  as select from
    demo\_join1
    {
      a as c1,
      b as c2
    }
union select from
  demo\_join2
    {
      d as c1,
      e as c2
    }
union all select from
  demo\_join3
    {
      i as c1,
      j as c2
    }; .

The original view has two UNION clauses represented using corresponding UNION additions in the definition of the CDS view extension. Two elements with matching types are added to the three SELECT lists of the original view.

Syntax

... @[annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_syntax.htm) ...

Effect

Specifies an [annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_syntax.htm) as an extension annotation in the definition of a [CDS view extension](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_extend_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") before the statement [EXTEND VIEW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_extend_view.htm). The character @ must be placed in front of the name annotation of the annotation. The annotation should be defined as a CDS object in a [CDS annotation definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_anno_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and the annotation definition annotation [@Scope](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_anno_annos.htm) should be specified here using the value #EXTEND\_VIEW.

The following tables show the possible [ABAP annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenabap_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that can be specified and their meanings. The ABAP annotations are evaluated by the ABAP runtime framework for every CDS entity. Annotations with other identifiers are usually [framework-specific annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_frmwrk.htm). These are not evaluated by the ABAP runtime framework but by other SAP frameworks instead.

The first column of the table shows the (possibly structured) name annotation of an ABAP annotation and the second column shows its meaning. The third column shows the possible [annotation values](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenannotation_value_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The fourth column shows the default value which is used if the annotation is not used at all. The fifth column shows the default value set implicitly for value in accordance with the [annotation definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_anno_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") if the annotation is specified without a value. If nothing is specified for the annotation value, the annotation should be specified without a value.

-   Each definition of a CDS view extension must contain the ABAP annotation AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName that defines the name of the DDIC append view in ABAP Dictionary.
-   The name given to the DDIC append view can no longer be changed after the CDS view extension is transported into a follow-on system.

Effect

Extends an existing [CDS DDIC-based view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_v1_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") ddic\_based\_view using a [CDS view extension](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_extend_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") cds\_view\_extension in the [CDS DDL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_ddl_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). An existing CDS DDIC-based view can have one or more CDS view extensions.

The extended CDS view ddic\_based\_view must be specified under the name of its [CDS entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The name of the [CDS-managed DDIC view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_mngdddic_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") cannot be specified.

Prerequisite

As a prerequisite for the enhancement of the CDS view with the statement EXTEND VIEW, the elements of the [annotation array](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenannotation_array_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory\[ \]](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_anno_v1.htm) must be specified accordingly in its definition with [DEFINE VIEW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_define_view_v1.htm):

-   By default or if only the value #PROJECTION\_LIST is specified, views without [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm) in the SELECT list and without a [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm) clause can be extended.
-   In order to extend views that have [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm) in the SELECT list, the annotation array must contain the value #GROUP\_BY alongside #PROJECTION\_LIST.
-   In order to extend views that contain [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm) clauses, the annotation array must contain the value #UNION alongside #PROJECTION\_LIST.
-   If the annotation array contains the value #NONE, the view cannot be extended.

Components of a view extension

View extensions can make additions to the original view, but it can't modify, overwrite, or delete elements from the original view. The following components are possible in a CDS view extension:

-   The annotation [AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm) is mandatory. Further annotations [extension\_annot1](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm), [extension\_annot2](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm), ... can also be specified. This is optional.
-   New associations association1, association2 can be defined and exposed in the CDS view extension. The same rules apply that are described in topic [CDS DDL - DDIC-based view, ASSOCIATION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_simple_association_v1.htm).
    
    Note: It is not allowed to define new [CDS compositions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_composition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or [CDS to-parent associations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abento_parent_association_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in a view extension.
    
-   The elements of the extension list select\_list\_extension specified after EXTEND VIEW are added to the existing SELECT list. At least one element must be added. It is possible to access all fields of all data sources of the extended view in the extension list select\_list\_extension. The list can have all [elements](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_entry_v1.htm) of a [SELECT list](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_v1.htm), namely:
    -   [field](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_field_v2.htm) of a data source
    -   [Input parameters](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_parameter_v1.htm) of the extended CDS view. It is not possible to specify new input parameters in a view extension.
    -   It can expose a [CDS association](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_association_v2.htm) of the extended view or a newly defined association
    -   Using a [path expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_path_expression_v1.htm), a field of an association target can be included. Path expressions are possible for associations of the extended view or for newly defined associations.
    -   [literals, session variables, expressions and functions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_operands_and_expr_v1.htm)
        
        Note: To add aggregate expressions to a view extension, special rules apply. See below.
        
-   Aggregate expressions are possible in the SELECT list of a view extension only if the following conditions are met:
    -   The original view must contain [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm). If the original view does not contain any aggregate expressions, this is not possible.
    -   The extended view must be annotated with AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory \[#PROJECTION\_LIST, #GROUP\_BY\]
    -   If non-aggregated elements are added to a CDS view with aggregate expressions, then the [GROUP-BY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_group_by_v1.htm) clause must be extended using the addition GROUP BY
-   If the original view contains [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm), equivalent UNION additions must be used in the statement EXTEND VIEW. As a prerequisite, the extended view must be annotated with AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory \[#PROJECTION\_LIST, #UNION\]
    
    If an appended element already occurs in the existing SELECT list or if a different extension occurs, it must be given an alternative element name using AS.
    

Restrictions

-   CDS views with an explicit [name list](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_name_list_v1.htm) cannot currently be extended.
-   CDS view extensions themselves cannot be extended.
-   It is not possible to specify new input parameters in a view extension.
-   No addition [ROOT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_define_root_view_v1.htm) can be specified in the statement EXTEND VIEW to transform a regular view to a [root entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenroot_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
-   An appended field cannot be defined as a key field using KEY.
-   It is not allowed to define new to-parent or composition associations in a view extension.
-   For views that have an element of data type LRAW or LCHR in the SELECT list, no view extension is possible and the annotation AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory\[#NONE\] is enforced. The reason is that elements of data types LRAW or LCHR must always be in the last position of the SELECT list.

Naming

Two repository objects are created for a CDS view extension that is defined using EXTEND VIEW. A name must be specified for each of the two objects:

-   The actual name cds\_view\_extension of the CDS view extension is specified after the keywords EXTEND VIEW. This name follows the same rules as the name of an [DDIC append view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_append_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), but can have up to 30 characters.
-   The name CDS\_APPEND\_VIEW for an [append view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_append_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in ABAP Dictionary must be specified in quotation marks after the annotation [@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm). This name is subject to the same rules as the name of a [DDIC database view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abendatabase_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in ABAP Dictionary, see topic [DDIC - Naming Rules for DDIC Views](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_view_names.htm). The new DDIC append view extends the [CDS-managed DDIC view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_mngdddic_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the extended CDS view. The name given to the DDIC append view can no longer be changed after the CDS view extension is transported into a follow-on system.

The name of the new DDIC append view and of the actual CDS view extension should be located in the customer namespace (or in the namespace of a partner or special development) to protect it against being overwritten by upgrades or new releases.

-   Once the DDL source code of a CDS view extension has been transported, the actual name cds\_view\_extension and the name of the DDIC append view CDS\_APPEND\_VIEW can no longer be changed. The extended view ddic\_based\_view can also no longer be changed.

Note: The DDL source code of a CDS view extension does not need to have the same name as the CDS view extension entity, but it is advisable to use the name of the entity.

Hints

-   Currently it is not possible to define extension categories for CDS views. The following restrictions apply for this reason:
    -   CDS views have the property can be extended in any way with respect to the [extension category of DDIC structures](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_structures_enh_cat.htm). The consequences of this must be respected when extending a CDS view.
    -   The attributes of a CDS view defined using [annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_anno_v1.htm), such as switching on [table buffering](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abentable_buffering_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), cannot currently be modified using extensions.
-   CDS view extensions specified with EXTEND ENTITY are recommended for CDS DDIC-based views only. However, for compatibility and migration reasons, it is also possible to extend [CDS projection views](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_projection_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or [CDS view entities](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_v2_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") with the statement EXTEND VIEW. However, view extends defined using EXTEND VIEW don't support the syntax elements specific to projection views and CDS view entities. Therefore, it is recommended to use the statement [EXTEND VIEW ENTITY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_extend_view_entity.htm) for extensions of CDS projection views and CDS view entities instead.
-   If, for some reason, a CDS projection view or a CDS view entity is extended with EXTEND VIEW, the [CDS-managed DDIC view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_mngdddic_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is deleted (as CDS projection views and CDS view entities do not have any DDIC artefacts), and entity annotations referring to the CDS-managed DDIC view are ignored.

Example

The following CDS view extension

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_EXTENS'
extend view demo\_cds\_original\_view with demo\_cds\_view\_extension  
  {
    spfli.distance,
    spfli.distid as unit
  };

adds two view fields to the existing CDS view

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_ORIG'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
@AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory: \[#PROJECTION\_LIST\]
@EndUserText.label: 'Further information about the CDS entity'
define view demo\_cds\_original\_view  
  as select from
           spfli
      join scarr on
        scarr.carrid = spfli.carrid
    {
      key scarr.carrname     as carrier,
      key spfli.connid       as flight,
          spfli.cityfrom     as departure,
          spfli.cityto       as destination
    }; .

The DDIC append view DEMO\_CDS\_EXTENS is created in ABAP Dictionary. The program DEMO\_CDS\_VIEW\_EXTENSION uses the statement [SELECT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abapselect.htm) to access the enhanced view and also displays the components of the dictionary structures in question.

Addition 1   

... GROUP BY field1, field2, ...

Effect

This addition must be specified if elements not defined using aggregate expressions are added to a view with [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm). These elements must be specified after GROUP BY add extend the [GROUP-BY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_group_by_v1.htm) clause of the original view. With respect to the extended view, the extended GROUP-BY clause must follow the general rules for a GROUP-BY clause.

The addition cannot be specified if the definition of the original view does not contain any aggregate expressions in its SELECT list.

Hint

Extensions of a view with aggregate expressions require it to contain the annotation array viewEnhancementCategory\[ \] with the value #GROUP\_BY.

Example

The following CDS view extension

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_EXTAGG'
extend view demo\_cds\_aggregate with demo\_cds\_extend\_aggregate
  {
    connid,  
    sum(distance) as sum\_distance
  }
  group by
    connid;

extends the existing CDS view

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_AGG'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
@AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory: \[#PROJECTION\_LIST,#GROUP\_BY\]
define view demo\_cds\_aggregate
  as select from
    spfli  
    {
      carrid,
      sum(fltime) as sum\_fltime
    }
    group by
      carrid; .

A database field connid and an aggregate expression sum(distance) are added to the SELECT list. Accordingly, the addition GROUP BY must be used to add the database field to the GROUP-BY clause of the original view.

Addition 2   

... UNION *\[*ALL*\]* { ... }

Effect

This addition must be specified when a view with [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm) clauses is extended. A corresponding UNION addition must be specified for each UNION clause of the original view. The addition ALL must be specified each time it is specified in the associated UNION clause of the original view. The curly brackets can contain elements that extend the SELECT list of the associated UNION clause of the original view. As specified by the SELECT list extended using select\_list\_extension, the UNION clauses must be extended so that the rules for UNION clauses are not broken in the extended view.

The addition cannot be specified if the definition of the original view does not have a UNION clause.

Hint

Extensions of a view with UNION clauses require it to contain the annotation array viewEnhancementCategory\[ \] with the value #UNION.

Example

The following CDS view extension

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_EXTUNI'
extend view demo\_cds\_union with demo\_cds\_extend\_union
  {
    c as c3,
    d as c4
  }
union
  {
    f as c3,
    g as c4
  }
union all
  {
    k as c3,
    l as c4
  };

extends the existing CDS view

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_UIO'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
@AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory: \[#PROJECTION\_LIST,#UNION\]
define view demo\_cds\_union
  as select from
    demo\_join1
    {
      a as c1,
      b as c2
    }
union select from
  demo\_join2
    {
      d as c1,
      e as c2
    }
union all select from
  demo\_join3
    {
      i as c1,
      j as c2
    }; .

The original view has two UNION clauses represented using corresponding UNION additions in the definition of the CDS view extension. Two elements with matching types are added to the three SELECT lists of the original view.

Syntax

... @[annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_syntax.htm) ...

Effect

Specifies an [annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_syntax.htm) as an extension annotation in the definition of a [CDS view extension](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_extend_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") before the statement [EXTEND VIEW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_extend_view.htm). The character @ must be placed in front of the name annotation of the annotation. The annotation should be defined as a CDS object in a [CDS annotation definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_anno_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and the annotation definition annotation [@Scope](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_anno_annos.htm) should be specified here using the value #EXTEND\_VIEW.

The following tables show the possible [ABAP annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenabap_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that can be specified and their meanings. The ABAP annotations are evaluated by the ABAP runtime framework for every CDS entity. Annotations with other identifiers are usually [framework-specific annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_frmwrk.htm). These are not evaluated by the ABAP runtime framework but by other SAP frameworks instead.

The first column of the table shows the (possibly structured) name annotation of an ABAP annotation and the second column shows its meaning. The third column shows the possible [annotation values](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenannotation_value_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The fourth column shows the default value which is used if the annotation is not used at all. The fifth column shows the default value set implicitly for value in accordance with the [annotation definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_anno_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") if the annotation is specified without a value. If nothing is specified for the annotation value, the annotation should be specified without a value.

Effect

Extends an existing [CDS DDIC-based view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_v1_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") ddic\_based\_view using a [CDS view extension](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_extend_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") cds\_view\_extension in the [CDS DDL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_ddl_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). An existing CDS DDIC-based view can have one or more CDS view extensions.

The extended CDS view ddic\_based\_view must be specified under the name of its [CDS entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The name of the [CDS-managed DDIC view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_mngdddic_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") cannot be specified.

Prerequisite

As a prerequisite for the enhancement of the CDS view with the statement EXTEND VIEW, the elements of the [annotation array](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenannotation_array_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory\[ \]](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_anno_v1.htm) must be specified accordingly in its definition with [DEFINE VIEW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_define_view_v1.htm):

-   By default or if only the value #PROJECTION\_LIST is specified, views without [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm) in the SELECT list and without a [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm) clause can be extended.
-   In order to extend views that have [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm) in the SELECT list, the annotation array must contain the value #GROUP\_BY alongside #PROJECTION\_LIST.
-   In order to extend views that contain [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm) clauses, the annotation array must contain the value #UNION alongside #PROJECTION\_LIST.
-   If the annotation array contains the value #NONE, the view cannot be extended.

Components of a view extension

View extensions can make additions to the original view, but it can't modify, overwrite, or delete elements from the original view. The following components are possible in a CDS view extension:

-   The annotation [AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm) is mandatory. Further annotations [extension\_annot1](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm), [extension\_annot2](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm), ... can also be specified. This is optional.
-   New associations association1, association2 can be defined and exposed in the CDS view extension. The same rules apply that are described in topic [CDS DDL - DDIC-based view, ASSOCIATION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_simple_association_v1.htm).
    
    Note: It is not allowed to define new [CDS compositions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_composition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or [CDS to-parent associations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abento_parent_association_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in a view extension.
    
-   The elements of the extension list select\_list\_extension specified after EXTEND VIEW are added to the existing SELECT list. At least one element must be added. It is possible to access all fields of all data sources of the extended view in the extension list select\_list\_extension. The list can have all [elements](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_entry_v1.htm) of a [SELECT list](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_v1.htm), namely:
    -   [field](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_field_v2.htm) of a data source
    -   [Input parameters](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_parameter_v1.htm) of the extended CDS view. It is not possible to specify new input parameters in a view extension.
    -   It can expose a [CDS association](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_association_v2.htm) of the extended view or a newly defined association
    -   Using a [path expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_path_expression_v1.htm), a field of an association target can be included. Path expressions are possible for associations of the extended view or for newly defined associations.
    -   [literals, session variables, expressions and functions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_operands_and_expr_v1.htm)
        
        Note: To add aggregate expressions to a view extension, special rules apply. See below.
        
-   Aggregate expressions are possible in the SELECT list of a view extension only if the following conditions are met:
    -   The original view must contain [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm). If the original view does not contain any aggregate expressions, this is not possible.
    -   The extended view must be annotated with AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory \[#PROJECTION\_LIST, #GROUP\_BY\]
    -   If non-aggregated elements are added to a CDS view with aggregate expressions, then the [GROUP-BY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_group_by_v1.htm) clause must be extended using the addition GROUP BY
-   If the original view contains [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm), equivalent UNION additions must be used in the statement EXTEND VIEW. As a prerequisite, the extended view must be annotated with AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory \[#PROJECTION\_LIST, #UNION\]
    
    If an appended element already occurs in the existing SELECT list or if a different extension occurs, it must be given an alternative element name using AS.
    

Restrictions

-   CDS views with an explicit [name list](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_name_list_v1.htm) cannot currently be extended.
-   CDS view extensions themselves cannot be extended.
-   It is not possible to specify new input parameters in a view extension.
-   No addition [ROOT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_define_root_view_v1.htm) can be specified in the statement EXTEND VIEW to transform a regular view to a [root entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenroot_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
-   An appended field cannot be defined as a key field using KEY.
-   It is not allowed to define new to-parent or composition associations in a view extension.
-   For views that have an element of data type LRAW or LCHR in the SELECT list, no view extension is possible and the annotation AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory\[#NONE\] is enforced. The reason is that elements of data types LRAW or LCHR must always be in the last position of the SELECT list.

Naming

Two repository objects are created for a CDS view extension that is defined using EXTEND VIEW. A name must be specified for each of the two objects:

-   The actual name cds\_view\_extension of the CDS view extension is specified after the keywords EXTEND VIEW. This name follows the same rules as the name of an [DDIC append view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_append_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), but can have up to 30 characters.
-   The name CDS\_APPEND\_VIEW for an [append view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_append_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in ABAP Dictionary must be specified in quotation marks after the annotation [@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm). This name is subject to the same rules as the name of a [DDIC database view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abendatabase_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in ABAP Dictionary, see topic [DDIC - Naming Rules for DDIC Views](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_view_names.htm). The new DDIC append view extends the [CDS-managed DDIC view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_mngdddic_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the extended CDS view. The name given to the DDIC append view can no longer be changed after the CDS view extension is transported into a follow-on system.

The name of the new DDIC append view and of the actual CDS view extension should be located in the customer namespace (or in the namespace of a partner or special development) to protect it against being overwritten by upgrades or new releases.

-   Once the DDL source code of a CDS view extension has been transported, the actual name cds\_view\_extension and the name of the DDIC append view CDS\_APPEND\_VIEW can no longer be changed. The extended view ddic\_based\_view can also no longer be changed.

Note: The DDL source code of a CDS view extension does not need to have the same name as the CDS view extension entity, but it is advisable to use the name of the entity.

Hints

-   Currently it is not possible to define extension categories for CDS views. The following restrictions apply for this reason:
    -   CDS views have the property can be extended in any way with respect to the [extension category of DDIC structures](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_structures_enh_cat.htm). The consequences of this must be respected when extending a CDS view.
    -   The attributes of a CDS view defined using [annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_anno_v1.htm), such as switching on [table buffering](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abentable_buffering_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), cannot currently be modified using extensions.
-   CDS view extensions specified with EXTEND ENTITY are recommended for CDS DDIC-based views only. However, for compatibility and migration reasons, it is also possible to extend [CDS projection views](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_projection_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or [CDS view entities](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_v2_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") with the statement EXTEND VIEW. However, view extends defined using EXTEND VIEW don't support the syntax elements specific to projection views and CDS view entities. Therefore, it is recommended to use the statement [EXTEND VIEW ENTITY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_extend_view_entity.htm) for extensions of CDS projection views and CDS view entities instead.
-   If, for some reason, a CDS projection view or a CDS view entity is extended with EXTEND VIEW, the [CDS-managed DDIC view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_mngdddic_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is deleted (as CDS projection views and CDS view entities do not have any DDIC artefacts), and entity annotations referring to the CDS-managed DDIC view are ignored.

Example

The following CDS view extension

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_EXTENS'
extend view demo\_cds\_original\_view with demo\_cds\_view\_extension  
  {
    spfli.distance,
    spfli.distid as unit
  };

adds two view fields to the existing CDS view

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_ORIG'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
@AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory: \[#PROJECTION\_LIST\]
@EndUserText.label: 'Further information about the CDS entity'
define view demo\_cds\_original\_view  
  as select from
           spfli
      join scarr on
        scarr.carrid = spfli.carrid
    {
      key scarr.carrname     as carrier,
      key spfli.connid       as flight,
          spfli.cityfrom     as departure,
          spfli.cityto       as destination
    }; .

The DDIC append view DEMO\_CDS\_EXTENS is created in ABAP Dictionary. The program DEMO\_CDS\_VIEW\_EXTENSION uses the statement [SELECT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abapselect.htm) to access the enhanced view and also displays the components of the dictionary structures in question.

Addition 1   

... GROUP BY field1, field2, ...

Effect

This addition must be specified if elements not defined using aggregate expressions are added to a view with [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm). These elements must be specified after GROUP BY add extend the [GROUP-BY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_group_by_v1.htm) clause of the original view. With respect to the extended view, the extended GROUP-BY clause must follow the general rules for a GROUP-BY clause.

The addition cannot be specified if the definition of the original view does not contain any aggregate expressions in its SELECT list.

Hint

Extensions of a view with aggregate expressions require it to contain the annotation array viewEnhancementCategory\[ \] with the value #GROUP\_BY.

Example

The following CDS view extension

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_EXTAGG'
extend view demo\_cds\_aggregate with demo\_cds\_extend\_aggregate
  {
    connid,  
    sum(distance) as sum\_distance
  }
  group by
    connid;

extends the existing CDS view

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_AGG'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
@AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory: \[#PROJECTION\_LIST,#GROUP\_BY\]
define view demo\_cds\_aggregate
  as select from
    spfli  
    {
      carrid,
      sum(fltime) as sum\_fltime
    }
    group by
      carrid; .

A database field connid and an aggregate expression sum(distance) are added to the SELECT list. Accordingly, the addition GROUP BY must be used to add the database field to the GROUP-BY clause of the original view.

Addition 2   

... UNION *\[*ALL*\]* { ... }

Effect

This addition must be specified when a view with [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm) clauses is extended. A corresponding UNION addition must be specified for each UNION clause of the original view. The addition ALL must be specified each time it is specified in the associated UNION clause of the original view. The curly brackets can contain elements that extend the SELECT list of the associated UNION clause of the original view. As specified by the SELECT list extended using select\_list\_extension, the UNION clauses must be extended so that the rules for UNION clauses are not broken in the extended view.

The addition cannot be specified if the definition of the original view does not have a UNION clause.

Hint

Extensions of a view with UNION clauses require it to contain the annotation array viewEnhancementCategory\[ \] with the value #UNION.

Example

The following CDS view extension

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_EXTUNI'
extend view demo\_cds\_union with demo\_cds\_extend\_union
  {
    c as c3,
    d as c4
  }
union
  {
    f as c3,
    g as c4
  }
union all
  {
    k as c3,
    l as c4
  };

extends the existing CDS view

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_UIO'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
@AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory: \[#PROJECTION\_LIST,#UNION\]
define view demo\_cds\_union
  as select from
    demo\_join1
    {
      a as c1,
      b as c2
    }
union select from
  demo\_join2
    {
      d as c1,
      e as c2
    }
union all select from
  demo\_join3
    {
      i as c1,
      j as c2
    }; .

The original view has two UNION clauses represented using corresponding UNION additions in the definition of the CDS view extension. Two elements with matching types are added to the three SELECT lists of the original view.

Syntax

... @[annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_syntax.htm) ...

Effect

Specifies an [annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_syntax.htm) as an extension annotation in the definition of a [CDS view extension](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_extend_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") before the statement [EXTEND VIEW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_extend_view.htm). The character @ must be placed in front of the name annotation of the annotation. The annotation should be defined as a CDS object in a [CDS annotation definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_anno_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and the annotation definition annotation [@Scope](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_anno_annos.htm) should be specified here using the value #EXTEND\_VIEW.

The following tables show the possible [ABAP annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenabap_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that can be specified and their meanings. The ABAP annotations are evaluated by the ABAP runtime framework for every CDS entity. Annotations with other identifiers are usually [framework-specific annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_frmwrk.htm). These are not evaluated by the ABAP runtime framework but by other SAP frameworks instead.

The first column of the table shows the (possibly structured) name annotation of an ABAP annotation and the second column shows its meaning. The third column shows the possible [annotation values](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenannotation_value_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The fourth column shows the default value which is used if the annotation is not used at all. The fifth column shows the default value set implicitly for value in accordance with the [annotation definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_anno_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") if the annotation is specified without a value. If nothing is specified for the annotation value, the annotation should be specified without a value.

Effect

Extends an existing [CDS DDIC-based view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_v1_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") ddic\_based\_view using a [CDS view extension](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_extend_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") cds\_view\_extension in the [CDS DDL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_ddl_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). An existing CDS DDIC-based view can have one or more CDS view extensions.

The extended CDS view ddic\_based\_view must be specified under the name of its [CDS entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The name of the [CDS-managed DDIC view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_mngdddic_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") cannot be specified.

Prerequisite

As a prerequisite for the enhancement of the CDS view with the statement EXTEND VIEW, the elements of the [annotation array](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenannotation_array_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory\[ \]](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_anno_v1.htm) must be specified accordingly in its definition with [DEFINE VIEW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_define_view_v1.htm):

-   By default or if only the value #PROJECTION\_LIST is specified, views without [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm) in the SELECT list and without a [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm) clause can be extended.
-   In order to extend views that have [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm) in the SELECT list, the annotation array must contain the value #GROUP\_BY alongside #PROJECTION\_LIST.
-   In order to extend views that contain [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm) clauses, the annotation array must contain the value #UNION alongside #PROJECTION\_LIST.
-   If the annotation array contains the value #NONE, the view cannot be extended.

Components of a view extension

View extensions can make additions to the original view, but it can't modify, overwrite, or delete elements from the original view. The following components are possible in a CDS view extension:

-   The annotation [AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm) is mandatory. Further annotations [extension\_annot1](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm), [extension\_annot2](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm), ... can also be specified. This is optional.
-   New associations association1, association2 can be defined and exposed in the CDS view extension. The same rules apply that are described in topic [CDS DDL - DDIC-based view, ASSOCIATION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_simple_association_v1.htm).
    
    Note: It is not allowed to define new [CDS compositions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_composition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or [CDS to-parent associations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abento_parent_association_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in a view extension.
    
-   The elements of the extension list select\_list\_extension specified after EXTEND VIEW are added to the existing SELECT list. At least one element must be added. It is possible to access all fields of all data sources of the extended view in the extension list select\_list\_extension. The list can have all [elements](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_entry_v1.htm) of a [SELECT list](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_v1.htm), namely:
    -   [field](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_field_v2.htm) of a data source
    -   [Input parameters](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_parameter_v1.htm) of the extended CDS view. It is not possible to specify new input parameters in a view extension.
    -   It can expose a [CDS association](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_association_v2.htm) of the extended view or a newly defined association
    -   Using a [path expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_path_expression_v1.htm), a field of an association target can be included. Path expressions are possible for associations of the extended view or for newly defined associations.
    -   [literals, session variables, expressions and functions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_operands_and_expr_v1.htm)
        
        Note: To add aggregate expressions to a view extension, special rules apply. See below.
        
-   Aggregate expressions are possible in the SELECT list of a view extension only if the following conditions are met:
    -   The original view must contain [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm). If the original view does not contain any aggregate expressions, this is not possible.
    -   The extended view must be annotated with AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory \[#PROJECTION\_LIST, #GROUP\_BY\]
    -   If non-aggregated elements are added to a CDS view with aggregate expressions, then the [GROUP-BY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_group_by_v1.htm) clause must be extended using the addition GROUP BY
-   If the original view contains [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm), equivalent UNION additions must be used in the statement EXTEND VIEW. As a prerequisite, the extended view must be annotated with AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory \[#PROJECTION\_LIST, #UNION\]
    
    If an appended element already occurs in the existing SELECT list or if a different extension occurs, it must be given an alternative element name using AS.
    

Restrictions

-   CDS views with an explicit [name list](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_name_list_v1.htm) cannot currently be extended.
-   CDS view extensions themselves cannot be extended.
-   It is not possible to specify new input parameters in a view extension.
-   No addition [ROOT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_define_root_view_v1.htm) can be specified in the statement EXTEND VIEW to transform a regular view to a [root entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenroot_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
-   An appended field cannot be defined as a key field using KEY.
-   It is not allowed to define new to-parent or composition associations in a view extension.
-   For views that have an element of data type LRAW or LCHR in the SELECT list, no view extension is possible and the annotation AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory\[#NONE\] is enforced. The reason is that elements of data types LRAW or LCHR must always be in the last position of the SELECT list.

Naming

Two repository objects are created for a CDS view extension that is defined using EXTEND VIEW. A name must be specified for each of the two objects:

-   The actual name cds\_view\_extension of the CDS view extension is specified after the keywords EXTEND VIEW. This name follows the same rules as the name of an [DDIC append view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_append_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), but can have up to 30 characters.
-   The name CDS\_APPEND\_VIEW for an [append view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_append_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in ABAP Dictionary must be specified in quotation marks after the annotation [@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm). This name is subject to the same rules as the name of a [DDIC database view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abendatabase_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in ABAP Dictionary, see topic [DDIC - Naming Rules for DDIC Views](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_view_names.htm). The new DDIC append view extends the [CDS-managed DDIC view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_mngdddic_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the extended CDS view. The name given to the DDIC append view can no longer be changed after the CDS view extension is transported into a follow-on system.

The name of the new DDIC append view and of the actual CDS view extension should be located in the customer namespace (or in the namespace of a partner or special development) to protect it against being overwritten by upgrades or new releases.

-   Once the DDL source code of a CDS view extension has been transported, the actual name cds\_view\_extension and the name of the DDIC append view CDS\_APPEND\_VIEW can no longer be changed. The extended view ddic\_based\_view can also no longer be changed.

Note: The DDL source code of a CDS view extension does not need to have the same name as the CDS view extension entity, but it is advisable to use the name of the entity.

Hints

-   Currently it is not possible to define extension categories for CDS views. The following restrictions apply for this reason:
    -   CDS views have the property can be extended in any way with respect to the [extension category of DDIC structures](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_structures_enh_cat.htm). The consequences of this must be respected when extending a CDS view.
    -   The attributes of a CDS view defined using [annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_anno_v1.htm), such as switching on [table buffering](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abentable_buffering_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), cannot currently be modified using extensions.
-   CDS view extensions specified with EXTEND ENTITY are recommended for CDS DDIC-based views only. However, for compatibility and migration reasons, it is also possible to extend [CDS projection views](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_projection_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or [CDS view entities](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_v2_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") with the statement EXTEND VIEW. However, view extends defined using EXTEND VIEW don't support the syntax elements specific to projection views and CDS view entities. Therefore, it is recommended to use the statement [EXTEND VIEW ENTITY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_extend_view_entity.htm) for extensions of CDS projection views and CDS view entities instead.
-   If, for some reason, a CDS projection view or a CDS view entity is extended with EXTEND VIEW, the [CDS-managed DDIC view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_mngdddic_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is deleted (as CDS projection views and CDS view entities do not have any DDIC artefacts), and entity annotations referring to the CDS-managed DDIC view are ignored.

Example

The following CDS view extension

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_EXTENS'
extend view demo\_cds\_original\_view with demo\_cds\_view\_extension  
  {
    spfli.distance,
    spfli.distid as unit
  };

adds two view fields to the existing CDS view

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_ORIG'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
@AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory: \[#PROJECTION\_LIST\]
@EndUserText.label: 'Further information about the CDS entity'
define view demo\_cds\_original\_view  
  as select from
           spfli
      join scarr on
        scarr.carrid = spfli.carrid
    {
      key scarr.carrname     as carrier,
      key spfli.connid       as flight,
          spfli.cityfrom     as departure,
          spfli.cityto       as destination
    }; .

The DDIC append view DEMO\_CDS\_EXTENS is created in ABAP Dictionary. The program DEMO\_CDS\_VIEW\_EXTENSION uses the statement [SELECT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abapselect.htm) to access the enhanced view and also displays the components of the dictionary structures in question.

Addition 1   

... GROUP BY field1, field2, ...

Effect

This addition must be specified if elements not defined using aggregate expressions are added to a view with [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm). These elements must be specified after GROUP BY add extend the [GROUP-BY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_group_by_v1.htm) clause of the original view. With respect to the extended view, the extended GROUP-BY clause must follow the general rules for a GROUP-BY clause.

The addition cannot be specified if the definition of the original view does not contain any aggregate expressions in its SELECT list.

Hint

Extensions of a view with aggregate expressions require it to contain the annotation array viewEnhancementCategory\[ \] with the value #GROUP\_BY.

Example

The following CDS view extension

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_EXTAGG'
extend view demo\_cds\_aggregate with demo\_cds\_extend\_aggregate
  {
    connid,  
    sum(distance) as sum\_distance
  }
  group by
    connid;

extends the existing CDS view

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_AGG'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
@AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory: \[#PROJECTION\_LIST,#GROUP\_BY\]
define view demo\_cds\_aggregate
  as select from
    spfli  
    {
      carrid,
      sum(fltime) as sum\_fltime
    }
    group by
      carrid; .

A database field connid and an aggregate expression sum(distance) are added to the SELECT list. Accordingly, the addition GROUP BY must be used to add the database field to the GROUP-BY clause of the original view.

Addition 2   

... UNION *\[*ALL*\]* { ... }

Effect

This addition must be specified when a view with [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm) clauses is extended. A corresponding UNION addition must be specified for each UNION clause of the original view. The addition ALL must be specified each time it is specified in the associated UNION clause of the original view. The curly brackets can contain elements that extend the SELECT list of the associated UNION clause of the original view. As specified by the SELECT list extended using select\_list\_extension, the UNION clauses must be extended so that the rules for UNION clauses are not broken in the extended view.

The addition cannot be specified if the definition of the original view does not have a UNION clause.

Hint

Extensions of a view with UNION clauses require it to contain the annotation array viewEnhancementCategory\[ \] with the value #UNION.

Example

The following CDS view extension

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_EXTUNI'
extend view demo\_cds\_union with demo\_cds\_extend\_union
  {
    c as c3,
    d as c4
  }
union
  {
    f as c3,
    g as c4
  }
union all
  {
    k as c3,
    l as c4
  };

extends the existing CDS view

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_UIO'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
@AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory: \[#PROJECTION\_LIST,#UNION\]
define view demo\_cds\_union
  as select from
    demo\_join1
    {
      a as c1,
      b as c2
    }
union select from
  demo\_join2
    {
      d as c1,
      e as c2
    }
union all select from
  demo\_join3
    {
      i as c1,
      j as c2
    }; .

The original view has two UNION clauses represented using corresponding UNION additions in the definition of the CDS view extension. Two elements with matching types are added to the three SELECT lists of the original view.

Syntax

... @[annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_syntax.htm) ...

Effect

Specifies an [annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_syntax.htm) as an extension annotation in the definition of a [CDS view extension](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_extend_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") before the statement [EXTEND VIEW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_extend_view.htm). The character @ must be placed in front of the name annotation of the annotation. The annotation should be defined as a CDS object in a [CDS annotation definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_anno_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and the annotation definition annotation [@Scope](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_anno_annos.htm) should be specified here using the value #EXTEND\_VIEW.

The following tables show the possible [ABAP annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenabap_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that can be specified and their meanings. The ABAP annotations are evaluated by the ABAP runtime framework for every CDS entity. Annotations with other identifiers are usually [framework-specific annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_frmwrk.htm). These are not evaluated by the ABAP runtime framework but by other SAP frameworks instead.

The first column of the table shows the (possibly structured) name annotation of an ABAP annotation and the second column shows its meaning. The third column shows the possible [annotation values](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenannotation_value_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The fourth column shows the default value which is used if the annotation is not used at all. The fifth column shows the default value set implicitly for value in accordance with the [annotation definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_anno_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") if the annotation is specified without a value. If nothing is specified for the annotation value, the annotation should be specified without a value.

Effect

Extends an existing [CDS DDIC-based view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_v1_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") ddic\_based\_view using a [CDS view extension](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_extend_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") cds\_view\_extension in the [CDS DDL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_ddl_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). An existing CDS DDIC-based view can have one or more CDS view extensions.

The extended CDS view ddic\_based\_view must be specified under the name of its [CDS entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The name of the [CDS-managed DDIC view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_mngdddic_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") cannot be specified.

Prerequisite

As a prerequisite for the enhancement of the CDS view with the statement EXTEND VIEW, the elements of the [annotation array](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenannotation_array_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory\[ \]](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_anno_v1.htm) must be specified accordingly in its definition with [DEFINE VIEW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_define_view_v1.htm):

-   By default or if only the value #PROJECTION\_LIST is specified, views without [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm) in the SELECT list and without a [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm) clause can be extended.
-   In order to extend views that have [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm) in the SELECT list, the annotation array must contain the value #GROUP\_BY alongside #PROJECTION\_LIST.
-   In order to extend views that contain [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm) clauses, the annotation array must contain the value #UNION alongside #PROJECTION\_LIST.
-   If the annotation array contains the value #NONE, the view cannot be extended.

Components of a view extension

View extensions can make additions to the original view, but it can't modify, overwrite, or delete elements from the original view. The following components are possible in a CDS view extension:

-   The annotation [AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm) is mandatory. Further annotations [extension\_annot1](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm), [extension\_annot2](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm), ... can also be specified. This is optional.
-   New associations association1, association2 can be defined and exposed in the CDS view extension. The same rules apply that are described in topic [CDS DDL - DDIC-based view, ASSOCIATION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_simple_association_v1.htm).
    
    Note: It is not allowed to define new [CDS compositions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_composition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or [CDS to-parent associations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abento_parent_association_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in a view extension.
    
-   The elements of the extension list select\_list\_extension specified after EXTEND VIEW are added to the existing SELECT list. At least one element must be added. It is possible to access all fields of all data sources of the extended view in the extension list select\_list\_extension. The list can have all [elements](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_entry_v1.htm) of a [SELECT list](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_v1.htm), namely:
    -   [field](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_field_v2.htm) of a data source
    -   [Input parameters](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_parameter_v1.htm) of the extended CDS view. It is not possible to specify new input parameters in a view extension.
    -   It can expose a [CDS association](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_association_v2.htm) of the extended view or a newly defined association
    -   Using a [path expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_path_expression_v1.htm), a field of an association target can be included. Path expressions are possible for associations of the extended view or for newly defined associations.
    -   [literals, session variables, expressions and functions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_operands_and_expr_v1.htm)
        
        Note: To add aggregate expressions to a view extension, special rules apply. See below.
        
-   Aggregate expressions are possible in the SELECT list of a view extension only if the following conditions are met:
    -   The original view must contain [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm). If the original view does not contain any aggregate expressions, this is not possible.
    -   The extended view must be annotated with AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory \[#PROJECTION\_LIST, #GROUP\_BY\]
    -   If non-aggregated elements are added to a CDS view with aggregate expressions, then the [GROUP-BY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_group_by_v1.htm) clause must be extended using the addition GROUP BY
-   If the original view contains [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm), equivalent UNION additions must be used in the statement EXTEND VIEW. As a prerequisite, the extended view must be annotated with AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory \[#PROJECTION\_LIST, #UNION\]
    
    If an appended element already occurs in the existing SELECT list or if a different extension occurs, it must be given an alternative element name using AS.
    

Restrictions

-   CDS views with an explicit [name list](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_name_list_v1.htm) cannot currently be extended.
-   CDS view extensions themselves cannot be extended.
-   It is not possible to specify new input parameters in a view extension.
-   No addition [ROOT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_define_root_view_v1.htm) can be specified in the statement EXTEND VIEW to transform a regular view to a [root entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenroot_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
-   An appended field cannot be defined as a key field using KEY.
-   It is not allowed to define new to-parent or composition associations in a view extension.
-   For views that have an element of data type LRAW or LCHR in the SELECT list, no view extension is possible and the annotation AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory\[#NONE\] is enforced. The reason is that elements of data types LRAW or LCHR must always be in the last position of the SELECT list.

Naming

Two repository objects are created for a CDS view extension that is defined using EXTEND VIEW. A name must be specified for each of the two objects:

-   The actual name cds\_view\_extension of the CDS view extension is specified after the keywords EXTEND VIEW. This name follows the same rules as the name of an [DDIC append view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_append_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), but can have up to 30 characters.
-   The name CDS\_APPEND\_VIEW for an [append view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_append_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in ABAP Dictionary must be specified in quotation marks after the annotation [@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm). This name is subject to the same rules as the name of a [DDIC database view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abendatabase_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in ABAP Dictionary, see topic [DDIC - Naming Rules for DDIC Views](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_view_names.htm). The new DDIC append view extends the [CDS-managed DDIC view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_mngdddic_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the extended CDS view. The name given to the DDIC append view can no longer be changed after the CDS view extension is transported into a follow-on system.

The name of the new DDIC append view and of the actual CDS view extension should be located in the customer namespace (or in the namespace of a partner or special development) to protect it against being overwritten by upgrades or new releases.

-   Once the DDL source code of a CDS view extension has been transported, the actual name cds\_view\_extension and the name of the DDIC append view CDS\_APPEND\_VIEW can no longer be changed. The extended view ddic\_based\_view can also no longer be changed.

Note: The DDL source code of a CDS view extension does not need to have the same name as the CDS view extension entity, but it is advisable to use the name of the entity.

Hints

-   Currently it is not possible to define extension categories for CDS views. The following restrictions apply for this reason:
    -   CDS views have the property can be extended in any way with respect to the [extension category of DDIC structures](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_structures_enh_cat.htm). The consequences of this must be respected when extending a CDS view.
    -   The attributes of a CDS view defined using [annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_anno_v1.htm), such as switching on [table buffering](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abentable_buffering_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), cannot currently be modified using extensions.
-   CDS view extensions specified with EXTEND ENTITY are recommended for CDS DDIC-based views only. However, for compatibility and migration reasons, it is also possible to extend [CDS projection views](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_projection_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or [CDS view entities](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_v2_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") with the statement EXTEND VIEW. However, view extends defined using EXTEND VIEW don't support the syntax elements specific to projection views and CDS view entities. Therefore, it is recommended to use the statement [EXTEND VIEW ENTITY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_extend_view_entity.htm) for extensions of CDS projection views and CDS view entities instead.
-   If, for some reason, a CDS projection view or a CDS view entity is extended with EXTEND VIEW, the [CDS-managed DDIC view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_mngdddic_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is deleted (as CDS projection views and CDS view entities do not have any DDIC artefacts), and entity annotations referring to the CDS-managed DDIC view are ignored.

Example

The following CDS view extension

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_EXTENS'
extend view demo\_cds\_original\_view with demo\_cds\_view\_extension  
  {
    spfli.distance,
    spfli.distid as unit
  };

adds two view fields to the existing CDS view

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_ORIG'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
@AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory: \[#PROJECTION\_LIST\]
@EndUserText.label: 'Further information about the CDS entity'
define view demo\_cds\_original\_view  
  as select from
           spfli
      join scarr on
        scarr.carrid = spfli.carrid
    {
      key scarr.carrname     as carrier,
      key spfli.connid       as flight,
          spfli.cityfrom     as departure,
          spfli.cityto       as destination
    }; .

The DDIC append view DEMO\_CDS\_EXTENS is created in ABAP Dictionary. The program DEMO\_CDS\_VIEW\_EXTENSION uses the statement [SELECT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abapselect.htm) to access the enhanced view and also displays the components of the dictionary structures in question.

Addition 1   

... GROUP BY field1, field2, ...

Effect

This addition must be specified if elements not defined using aggregate expressions are added to a view with [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm). These elements must be specified after GROUP BY add extend the [GROUP-BY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_group_by_v1.htm) clause of the original view. With respect to the extended view, the extended GROUP-BY clause must follow the general rules for a GROUP-BY clause.

The addition cannot be specified if the definition of the original view does not contain any aggregate expressions in its SELECT list.

Hint

Extensions of a view with aggregate expressions require it to contain the annotation array viewEnhancementCategory\[ \] with the value #GROUP\_BY.

Example

The following CDS view extension

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_EXTAGG'
extend view demo\_cds\_aggregate with demo\_cds\_extend\_aggregate
  {
    connid,  
    sum(distance) as sum\_distance
  }
  group by
    connid;

extends the existing CDS view

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_AGG'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
@AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory: \[#PROJECTION\_LIST,#GROUP\_BY\]
define view demo\_cds\_aggregate
  as select from
    spfli  
    {
      carrid,
      sum(fltime) as sum\_fltime
    }
    group by
      carrid; .

A database field connid and an aggregate expression sum(distance) are added to the SELECT list. Accordingly, the addition GROUP BY must be used to add the database field to the GROUP-BY clause of the original view.

Addition 2   

... UNION *\[*ALL*\]* { ... }

Effect

This addition must be specified when a view with [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm) clauses is extended. A corresponding UNION addition must be specified for each UNION clause of the original view. The addition ALL must be specified each time it is specified in the associated UNION clause of the original view. The curly brackets can contain elements that extend the SELECT list of the associated UNION clause of the original view. As specified by the SELECT list extended using select\_list\_extension, the UNION clauses must be extended so that the rules for UNION clauses are not broken in the extended view.

The addition cannot be specified if the definition of the original view does not have a UNION clause.

Hint

Extensions of a view with UNION clauses require it to contain the annotation array viewEnhancementCategory\[ \] with the value #UNION.

Example

The following CDS view extension

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_EXTUNI'
extend view demo\_cds\_union with demo\_cds\_extend\_union
  {
    c as c3,
    d as c4
  }
union
  {
    f as c3,
    g as c4
  }
union all
  {
    k as c3,
    l as c4
  };

extends the existing CDS view

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_UIO'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
@AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory: \[#PROJECTION\_LIST,#UNION\]
define view demo\_cds\_union
  as select from
    demo\_join1
    {
      a as c1,
      b as c2
    }
union select from
  demo\_join2
    {
      d as c1,
      e as c2
    }
union all select from
  demo\_join3
    {
      i as c1,
      j as c2
    }; .

The original view has two UNION clauses represented using corresponding UNION additions in the definition of the CDS view extension. Two elements with matching types are added to the three SELECT lists of the original view.

Syntax

... @[annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_syntax.htm) ...

Effect

Specifies an [annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_syntax.htm) as an extension annotation in the definition of a [CDS view extension](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_extend_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") before the statement [EXTEND VIEW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_extend_view.htm). The character @ must be placed in front of the name annotation of the annotation. The annotation should be defined as a CDS object in a [CDS annotation definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_anno_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and the annotation definition annotation [@Scope](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_anno_annos.htm) should be specified here using the value #EXTEND\_VIEW.

The following tables show the possible [ABAP annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenabap_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that can be specified and their meanings. The ABAP annotations are evaluated by the ABAP runtime framework for every CDS entity. Annotations with other identifiers are usually [framework-specific annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_frmwrk.htm). These are not evaluated by the ABAP runtime framework but by other SAP frameworks instead.

The first column of the table shows the (possibly structured) name annotation of an ABAP annotation and the second column shows its meaning. The third column shows the possible [annotation values](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenannotation_value_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The fourth column shows the default value which is used if the annotation is not used at all. The fifth column shows the default value set implicitly for value in accordance with the [annotation definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_anno_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") if the annotation is specified without a value.

Effect

Extends an existing [CDS DDIC-based view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_v1_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") ddic\_based\_view using a [CDS view extension](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_extend_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") cds\_view\_extension in the [CDS DDL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_ddl_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). An existing CDS DDIC-based view can have one or more CDS view extensions.

The extended CDS view ddic\_based\_view must be specified under the name of its [CDS entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The name of the [CDS-managed DDIC view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_mngdddic_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") cannot be specified.

Prerequisite

As a prerequisite for the enhancement of the CDS view with the statement EXTEND VIEW, the elements of the [annotation array](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenannotation_array_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory\[ \]](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_anno_v1.htm) must be specified accordingly in its definition with [DEFINE VIEW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_define_view_v1.htm):

-   By default or if only the value #PROJECTION\_LIST is specified, views without [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm) in the SELECT list and without a [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm) clause can be extended.
-   In order to extend views that have [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm) in the SELECT list, the annotation array must contain the value #GROUP\_BY alongside #PROJECTION\_LIST.
-   In order to extend views that contain [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm) clauses, the annotation array must contain the value #UNION alongside #PROJECTION\_LIST.
-   If the annotation array contains the value #NONE, the view cannot be extended.

Components of a view extension

View extensions can make additions to the original view, but it can't modify, overwrite, or delete elements from the original view. The following components are possible in a CDS view extension:

-   The annotation [AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm) is mandatory. Further annotations [extension\_annot1](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm), [extension\_annot2](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm), ... can also be specified. This is optional.
-   New associations association1, association2 can be defined and exposed in the CDS view extension. The same rules apply that are described in topic [CDS DDL - DDIC-based view, ASSOCIATION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_simple_association_v1.htm).
    
    Note: It is not allowed to define new [CDS compositions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_composition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or [CDS to-parent associations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abento_parent_association_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in a view extension.
    
-   The elements of the extension list select\_list\_extension specified after EXTEND VIEW are added to the existing SELECT list. At least one element must be added. It is possible to access all fields of all data sources of the extended view in the extension list select\_list\_extension. The list can have all [elements](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_entry_v1.htm) of a [SELECT list](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_v1.htm), namely:
    -   [field](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_field_v2.htm) of a data source
    -   [Input parameters](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_parameter_v1.htm) of the extended CDS view. It is not possible to specify new input parameters in a view extension.
    -   It can expose a [CDS association](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_association_v2.htm) of the extended view or a newly defined association
    -   Using a [path expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_path_expression_v1.htm), a field of an association target can be included. Path expressions are possible for associations of the extended view or for newly defined associations.
    -   [literals, session variables, expressions and functions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_operands_and_expr_v1.htm)
        
        Note: To add aggregate expressions to a view extension, special rules apply. See below.
        
-   Aggregate expressions are possible in the SELECT list of a view extension only if the following conditions are met:
    -   The original view must contain [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm). If the original view does not contain any aggregate expressions, this is not possible.
    -   The extended view must be annotated with AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory \[#PROJECTION\_LIST, #GROUP\_BY\]
    -   If non-aggregated elements are added to a CDS view with aggregate expressions, then the [GROUP-BY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_group_by_v1.htm) clause must be extended using the addition GROUP BY
-   If the original view contains [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm), equivalent UNION additions must be used in the statement EXTEND VIEW. As a prerequisite, the extended view must be annotated with AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory \[#PROJECTION\_LIST, #UNION\]
    
    If an appended element already occurs in the existing SELECT list or if a different extension occurs, it must be given an alternative element name using AS.
    

Restrictions

-   CDS views with an explicit [name list](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_name_list_v1.htm) cannot currently be extended.
-   CDS view extensions themselves cannot be extended.
-   It is not possible to specify new input parameters in a view extension.
-   No addition [ROOT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_define_root_view_v1.htm) can be specified in the statement EXTEND VIEW to transform a regular view to a [root entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenroot_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
-   An appended field cannot be defined as a key field using KEY.
-   It is not allowed to define new to-parent or composition associations in a view extension.
-   For views that have an element of data type LRAW or LCHR in the SELECT list, no view extension is possible and the annotation AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory\[#NONE\] is enforced. The reason is that elements of data types LRAW or LCHR must always be in the last position of the SELECT list.

Naming

Two repository objects are created for a CDS view extension that is defined using EXTEND VIEW. A name must be specified for each of the two objects:

-   The actual name cds\_view\_extension of the CDS view extension is specified after the keywords EXTEND VIEW. This name follows the same rules as the name of an [DDIC append view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_append_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), but can have up to 30 characters.
-   The name CDS\_APPEND\_VIEW for an [append view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_append_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in ABAP Dictionary must be specified in quotation marks after the annotation [@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm). This name is subject to the same rules as the name of a [DDIC database view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abendatabase_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in ABAP Dictionary, see topic [DDIC - Naming Rules for DDIC Views](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_view_names.htm). The new DDIC append view extends the [CDS-managed DDIC view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_mngdddic_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the extended CDS view. The name given to the DDIC append view can no longer be changed after the CDS view extension is transported into a follow-on system.

The name of the new DDIC append view and of the actual CDS view extension should be located in the customer namespace (or in the namespace of a partner or special development) to protect it against being overwritten by upgrades or new releases.

-   Once the DDL source code of a CDS view extension has been transported, the actual name cds\_view\_extension and the name of the DDIC append view CDS\_APPEND\_VIEW can no longer be changed. The extended view ddic\_based\_view can also no longer be changed.

Note: The DDL source code of a CDS view extension does not need to have the same name as the CDS view extension entity, but it is advisable to use the name of the entity.

Hints

-   Currently it is not possible to define extension categories for CDS views. The following restrictions apply for this reason:
    -   CDS views have the property can be extended in any way with respect to the [extension category of DDIC structures](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_structures_enh_cat.htm). The consequences of this must be respected when extending a CDS view.
    -   The attributes of a CDS view defined using [annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_anno_v1.htm), such as switching on [table buffering](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abentable_buffering_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), cannot currently be modified using extensions.
-   CDS view extensions specified with EXTEND ENTITY are recommended for CDS DDIC-based views only. However, for compatibility and migration reasons, it is also possible to extend [CDS projection views](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_projection_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or [CDS view entities](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_v2_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") with the statement EXTEND VIEW. However, view extends defined using EXTEND VIEW don't support the syntax elements specific to projection views and CDS view entities. Therefore, it is recommended to use the statement [EXTEND VIEW ENTITY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_extend_view_entity.htm) for extensions of CDS projection views and CDS view entities instead.
-   If, for some reason, a CDS projection view or a CDS view entity is extended with EXTEND VIEW, the [CDS-managed DDIC view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_mngdddic_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is deleted (as CDS projection views and CDS view entities do not have any DDIC artefacts), and entity annotations referring to the CDS-managed DDIC view are ignored.

Example

The following CDS view extension

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_EXTENS'
extend view demo\_cds\_original\_view with demo\_cds\_view\_extension  
  {
    spfli.distance,
    spfli.distid as unit
  };

adds two view fields to the existing CDS view

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_ORIG'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
@AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory: \[#PROJECTION\_LIST\]
@EndUserText.label: 'Further information about the CDS entity'
define view demo\_cds\_original\_view  
  as select from
           spfli
      join scarr on
        scarr.carrid = spfli.carrid
    {
      key scarr.carrname     as carrier,
      key spfli.connid       as flight,
          spfli.cityfrom     as departure,
          spfli.cityto       as destination
    }; .

The DDIC append view DEMO\_CDS\_EXTENS is created in ABAP Dictionary. The program DEMO\_CDS\_VIEW\_EXTENSION uses the statement [SELECT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abapselect.htm) to access the enhanced view and also displays the components of the dictionary structures in question.

Addition 1   

... GROUP BY field1, field2, ...

Effect

This addition must be specified if elements not defined using aggregate expressions are added to a view with [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm). These elements must be specified after GROUP BY add extend the [GROUP-BY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_group_by_v1.htm) clause of the original view. With respect to the extended view, the extended GROUP-BY clause must follow the general rules for a GROUP-BY clause.

The addition cannot be specified if the definition of the original view does not contain any aggregate expressions in its SELECT list.

Hint

Extensions of a view with aggregate expressions require it to contain the annotation array viewEnhancementCategory\[ \] with the value #GROUP\_BY.

Example

The following CDS view extension

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_EXTAGG'
extend view demo\_cds\_aggregate with demo\_cds\_extend\_aggregate
  {
    connid,  
    sum(distance) as sum\_distance
  }
  group by
    connid;

extends the existing CDS view

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_AGG'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
@AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory: \[#PROJECTION\_LIST,#GROUP\_BY\]
define view demo\_cds\_aggregate
  as select from
    spfli  
    {
      carrid,
      sum(fltime) as sum\_fltime
    }
    group by
      carrid; .

A database field connid and an aggregate expression sum(distance) are added to the SELECT list. Accordingly, the addition GROUP BY must be used to add the database field to the GROUP-BY clause of the original view.

Addition 2   

... UNION *\[*ALL*\]* { ... }

Effect

This addition must be specified when a view with [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm) clauses is extended. A corresponding UNION addition must be specified for each UNION clause of the original view. The addition ALL must be specified each time it is specified in the associated UNION clause of the original view. The curly brackets can contain elements that extend the SELECT list of the associated UNION clause of the original view. As specified by the SELECT list extended using select\_list\_extension, the UNION clauses must be extended so that the rules for UNION clauses are not broken in the extended view.

The addition cannot be specified if the definition of the original view does not have a UNION clause.

Hint

Extensions of a view with UNION clauses require it to contain the annotation array viewEnhancementCategory\[ \] with the value #UNION.

Example

The following CDS view extension

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_EXTUNI'
extend view demo\_cds\_union with demo\_cds\_extend\_union
  {
    c as c3,
    d as c4
  }
union
  {
    f as c3,
    g as c4
  }
union all
  {
    k as c3,
    l as c4
  };

extends the existing CDS view

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_UIO'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
@AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory: \[#PROJECTION\_LIST,#UNION\]
define view demo\_cds\_union
  as select from
    demo\_join1
    {
      a as c1,
      b as c2
    }
union select from
  demo\_join2
    {
      d as c1,
      e as c2
    }
union all select from
  demo\_join3
    {
      i as c1,
      j as c2
    }; .

The original view has two UNION clauses represented using corresponding UNION additions in the definition of the CDS view extension. Two elements with matching types are added to the three SELECT lists of the original view.

Syntax

... @[annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_syntax.htm) ...

Effect

Specifies an [annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_syntax.htm) as an extension annotation in the definition of a [CDS view extension](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_extend_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") before the statement [EXTEND VIEW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_extend_view.htm). The character @ must be placed in front of the name annotation of the annotation. The annotation should be defined as a CDS object in a [CDS annotation definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_anno_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and the annotation definition annotation [@Scope](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_anno_annos.htm) should be specified here using the value #EXTEND\_VIEW.

The following tables show the possible [ABAP annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenabap_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that can be specified and their meanings. The ABAP annotations are evaluated by the ABAP runtime framework for every CDS entity. Annotations with other identifiers are usually [framework-specific annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_frmwrk.htm). These are not evaluated by the ABAP runtime framework but by other SAP frameworks instead.

The first column of the table shows the (possibly structured) name annotation of an ABAP annotation and the second column shows its meaning.

Effect

Extends an existing [CDS DDIC-based view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_v1_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") ddic\_based\_view using a [CDS view extension](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_extend_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") cds\_view\_extension in the [CDS DDL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_ddl_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). An existing CDS DDIC-based view can have one or more CDS view extensions.

The extended CDS view ddic\_based\_view must be specified under the name of its [CDS entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The name of the [CDS-managed DDIC view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_mngdddic_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") cannot be specified.

Prerequisite

As a prerequisite for the enhancement of the CDS view with the statement EXTEND VIEW, the elements of the [annotation array](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenannotation_array_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory\[ \]](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_anno_v1.htm) must be specified accordingly in its definition with [DEFINE VIEW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_define_view_v1.htm):

-   By default or if only the value #PROJECTION\_LIST is specified, views without [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm) in the SELECT list and without a [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm) clause can be extended.
-   In order to extend views that have [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm) in the SELECT list, the annotation array must contain the value #GROUP\_BY alongside #PROJECTION\_LIST.
-   In order to extend views that contain [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm) clauses, the annotation array must contain the value #UNION alongside #PROJECTION\_LIST.
-   If the annotation array contains the value #NONE, the view cannot be extended.

Components of a view extension

View extensions can make additions to the original view, but it can't modify, overwrite, or delete elements from the original view. The following components are possible in a CDS view extension:

-   The annotation [AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm) is mandatory. Further annotations [extension\_annot1](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm), [extension\_annot2](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm), ... can also be specified. This is optional.
-   New associations association1, association2 can be defined and exposed in the CDS view extension. The same rules apply that are described in topic [CDS DDL - DDIC-based view, ASSOCIATION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_simple_association_v1.htm).
    
    Note: It is not allowed to define new [CDS compositions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_composition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or [CDS to-parent associations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abento_parent_association_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in a view extension.
    
-   The elements of the extension list select\_list\_extension specified after EXTEND VIEW are added to the existing SELECT list. At least one element must be added. It is possible to access all fields of all data sources of the extended view in the extension list select\_list\_extension. The list can have all [elements](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_entry_v1.htm) of a [SELECT list](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_v1.htm), namely:
    -   [field](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_field_v2.htm) of a data source
    -   [Input parameters](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_parameter_v1.htm) of the extended CDS view. It is not possible to specify new input parameters in a view extension.
    -   It can expose a [CDS association](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_association_v2.htm) of the extended view or a newly defined association
    -   Using a [path expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_path_expression_v1.htm), a field of an association target can be included. Path expressions are possible for associations of the extended view or for newly defined associations.
    -   [literals, session variables, expressions and functions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_operands_and_expr_v1.htm)
        
        Note: To add aggregate expressions to a view extension, special rules apply. See below.
        
-   Aggregate expressions are possible in the SELECT list of a view extension only if the following conditions are met:
    -   The original view must contain [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm). If the original view does not contain any aggregate expressions, this is not possible.
    -   The extended view must be annotated with AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory \[#PROJECTION\_LIST, #GROUP\_BY\]
    -   If non-aggregated elements are added to a CDS view with aggregate expressions, then the [GROUP-BY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_group_by_v1.htm) clause must be extended using the addition GROUP BY
-   If the original view contains [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm), equivalent UNION additions must be used in the statement EXTEND VIEW. As a prerequisite, the extended view must be annotated with AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory \[#PROJECTION\_LIST, #UNION\]
    
    If an appended element already occurs in the existing SELECT list or if a different extension occurs, it must be given an alternative element name using AS.
    

Restrictions

-   CDS views with an explicit [name list](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_name_list_v1.htm) cannot currently be extended.
-   CDS view extensions themselves cannot be extended.
-   It is not possible to specify new input parameters in a view extension.
-   No addition [ROOT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_define_root_view_v1.htm) can be specified in the statement EXTEND VIEW to transform a regular view to a [root entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenroot_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
-   An appended field cannot be defined as a key field using KEY.
-   It is not allowed to define new to-parent or composition associations in a view extension.
-   For views that have an element of data type LRAW or LCHR in the SELECT list, no view extension is possible and the annotation AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory\[#NONE\] is enforced. The reason is that elements of data types LRAW or LCHR must always be in the last position of the SELECT list.

Naming

Two repository objects are created for a CDS view extension that is defined using EXTEND VIEW. A name must be specified for each of the two objects:

-   The actual name cds\_view\_extension of the CDS view extension is specified after the keywords EXTEND VIEW. This name follows the same rules as the name of an [DDIC append view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_append_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), but can have up to 30 characters.
-   The name CDS\_APPEND\_VIEW for an [append view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_append_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in ABAP Dictionary must be specified in quotation marks after the annotation [@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm). This name is subject to the same rules as the name of a [DDIC database view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abendatabase_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in ABAP Dictionary, see topic [DDIC - Naming Rules for DDIC Views](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_view_names.htm). The new DDIC append view extends the [CDS-managed DDIC view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_mngdddic_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the extended CDS view. The name given to the DDIC append view can no longer be changed after the CDS view extension is transported into a follow-on system.

The name of the new DDIC append view and of the actual CDS view extension should be located in the customer namespace (or in the namespace of a partner or special development) to protect it against being overwritten by upgrades or new releases.

-   Once the DDL source code of a CDS view extension has been transported, the actual name cds\_view\_extension and the name of the DDIC append view CDS\_APPEND\_VIEW can no longer be changed. The extended view ddic\_based\_view can also no longer be changed.

Note: The DDL source code of a CDS view extension does not need to have the same name as the CDS view extension entity, but it is advisable to use the name of the entity.

Hints

-   Currently it is not possible to define extension categories for CDS views. The following restrictions apply for this reason:
    -   CDS views have the property can be extended in any way with respect to the [extension category of DDIC structures](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_structures_enh_cat.htm). The consequences of this must be respected when extending a CDS view.
    -   The attributes of a CDS view defined using [annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_anno_v1.htm), such as switching on [table buffering](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abentable_buffering_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), cannot currently be modified using extensions.
-   CDS view extensions specified with EXTEND ENTITY are recommended for CDS DDIC-based views only. However, for compatibility and migration reasons, it is also possible to extend [CDS projection views](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_projection_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or [CDS view entities](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_v2_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") with the statement EXTEND VIEW. However, view extends defined using EXTEND VIEW don't support the syntax elements specific to projection views and CDS view entities. Therefore, it is recommended to use the statement [EXTEND VIEW ENTITY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_extend_view_entity.htm) for extensions of CDS projection views and CDS view entities instead.
-   If, for some reason, a CDS projection view or a CDS view entity is extended with EXTEND VIEW, the [CDS-managed DDIC view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_mngdddic_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is deleted (as CDS projection views and CDS view entities do not have any DDIC artefacts), and entity annotations referring to the CDS-managed DDIC view are ignored.

Example

The following CDS view extension

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_EXTENS'
extend view demo\_cds\_original\_view with demo\_cds\_view\_extension  
  {
    spfli.distance,
    spfli.distid as unit
  };

adds two view fields to the existing CDS view

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_ORIG'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
@AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory: \[#PROJECTION\_LIST\]
@EndUserText.label: 'Further information about the CDS entity'
define view demo\_cds\_original\_view  
  as select from
           spfli
      join scarr on
        scarr.carrid = spfli.carrid
    {
      key scarr.carrname     as carrier,
      key spfli.connid       as flight,
          spfli.cityfrom     as departure,
          spfli.cityto       as destination
    }; .

The DDIC append view DEMO\_CDS\_EXTENS is created in ABAP Dictionary. The program DEMO\_CDS\_VIEW\_EXTENSION uses the statement [SELECT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abapselect.htm) to access the enhanced view and also displays the components of the dictionary structures in question.

Addition 1   

... GROUP BY field1, field2, ...

Effect

This addition must be specified if elements not defined using aggregate expressions are added to a view with [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm). These elements must be specified after GROUP BY add extend the [GROUP-BY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_group_by_v1.htm) clause of the original view. With respect to the extended view, the extended GROUP-BY clause must follow the general rules for a GROUP-BY clause.

The addition cannot be specified if the definition of the original view does not contain any aggregate expressions in its SELECT list.

Hint

Extensions of a view with aggregate expressions require it to contain the annotation array viewEnhancementCategory\[ \] with the value #GROUP\_BY.

Example

The following CDS view extension

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_EXTAGG'
extend view demo\_cds\_aggregate with demo\_cds\_extend\_aggregate
  {
    connid,  
    sum(distance) as sum\_distance
  }
  group by
    connid;

extends the existing CDS view

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_AGG'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
@AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory: \[#PROJECTION\_LIST,#GROUP\_BY\]
define view demo\_cds\_aggregate
  as select from
    spfli  
    {
      carrid,
      sum(fltime) as sum\_fltime
    }
    group by
      carrid; .

A database field connid and an aggregate expression sum(distance) are added to the SELECT list. Accordingly, the addition GROUP BY must be used to add the database field to the GROUP-BY clause of the original view.

Addition 2   

... UNION *\[*ALL*\]* { ... }

Effect

This addition must be specified when a view with [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm) clauses is extended. A corresponding UNION addition must be specified for each UNION clause of the original view. The addition ALL must be specified each time it is specified in the associated UNION clause of the original view. The curly brackets can contain elements that extend the SELECT list of the associated UNION clause of the original view. As specified by the SELECT list extended using select\_list\_extension, the UNION clauses must be extended so that the rules for UNION clauses are not broken in the extended view.

The addition cannot be specified if the definition of the original view does not have a UNION clause.

Hint

Extensions of a view with UNION clauses require it to contain the annotation array viewEnhancementCategory\[ \] with the value #UNION.

Example

The following CDS view extension

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_EXTUNI'
extend view demo\_cds\_union with demo\_cds\_extend\_union
  {
    c as c3,
    d as c4
  }
union
  {
    f as c3,
    g as c4
  }
union all
  {
    k as c3,
    l as c4
  };

extends the existing CDS view

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_UIO'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
@AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory: \[#PROJECTION\_LIST,#UNION\]
define view demo\_cds\_union
  as select from
    demo\_join1
    {
      a as c1,
      b as c2
    }
union select from
  demo\_join2
    {
      d as c1,
      e as c2
    }
union all select from
  demo\_join3
    {
      i as c1,
      j as c2
    }; .

The original view has two UNION clauses represented using corresponding UNION additions in the definition of the CDS view extension. Two elements with matching types are added to the three SELECT lists of the original view.

Syntax

... @[annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_syntax.htm) ...

Effect

Specifies an [annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_syntax.htm) as an extension annotation in the definition of a [CDS view extension](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_extend_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") before the statement [EXTEND VIEW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_extend_view.htm). The character @ must be placed in front of the name annotation of the annotation. The annotation should be defined as a CDS object in a [CDS annotation definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_anno_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and the annotation definition annotation [@Scope](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_anno_annos.htm) should be specified here using the value #EXTEND\_VIEW.

The following tables show the possible [ABAP annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenabap_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that can be specified and their meanings. The ABAP annotations are evaluated by the ABAP runtime framework for every CDS entity. Annotations with other identifiers are usually [framework-specific annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_frmwrk.htm). These are not evaluated by the ABAP runtime framework but by other SAP frameworks instead.

The first column of the table shows the (possibly structured) name annotation of an ABAP annotation and the second column shows its meaning. The third column shows the possible [annotation values](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenannotation_value_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The fourth column shows the default value which is used if the annotation is not used at all. The fifth column shows the default value set implicitly for value in accordance with the [annotation definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_anno_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") if the annotation is specified without a value. If nothing is specified for the annotation value, the annotation should be specified without a value.

Effect

Extends an existing [CDS DDIC-based view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_v1_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") ddic\_based\_view using a [CDS view extension](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_extend_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") cds\_view\_extension in the [CDS DDL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_ddl_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). An existing CDS DDIC-based view can have one or more CDS view extensions.

The extended CDS view ddic\_based\_view must be specified under the name of its [CDS entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The name of the [CDS-managed DDIC view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_mngdddic_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") cannot be specified.

Prerequisite

As a prerequisite for the enhancement of the CDS view with the statement EXTEND VIEW, the elements of the [annotation array](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenannotation_array_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory\[ \]](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_anno_v1.htm) must be specified accordingly in its definition with [DEFINE VIEW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_define_view_v1.htm):

-   By default or if only the value #PROJECTION\_LIST is specified, views without [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm) in the SELECT list and without a [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm) clause can be extended.
-   In order to extend views that have [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm) in the SELECT list, the annotation array must contain the value #GROUP\_BY alongside #PROJECTION\_LIST.
-   In order to extend views that contain [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm) clauses, the annotation array must contain the value #UNION alongside #PROJECTION\_LIST.
-   If the annotation array contains the value #NONE, the view cannot be extended.

Components of a view extension

View extensions can make additions to the original view, but it can't modify, overwrite, or delete elements from the original view. The following components are possible in a CDS view extension:

-   The annotation [AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm) is mandatory. Further annotations [extension\_annot1](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm), [extension\_annot2](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm), ... can also be specified. This is optional.
-   New associations association1, association2 can be defined and exposed in the CDS view extension. The same rules apply that are described in topic [CDS DDL - DDIC-based view, ASSOCIATION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_simple_association_v1.htm).
    
    Note: It is not allowed to define new [CDS compositions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_composition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or [CDS to-parent associations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abento_parent_association_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in a view extension.
    
-   The elements of the extension list select\_list\_extension specified after EXTEND VIEW are added to the existing SELECT list. At least one element must be added. It is possible to access all fields of all data sources of the extended view in the extension list select\_list\_extension. The list can have all [elements](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_entry_v1.htm) of a [SELECT list](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_v1.htm), namely:
    -   [field](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_field_v2.htm) of a data source
    -   [Input parameters](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_parameter_v1.htm) of the extended CDS view. It is not possible to specify new input parameters in a view extension.
    -   It can expose a [CDS association](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_association_v2.htm) of the extended view or a newly defined association
    -   Using a [path expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_path_expression_v1.htm), a field of an association target can be included. Path expressions are possible for associations of the extended view or for newly defined associations.
    -   [literals, session variables, expressions and functions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_operands_and_expr_v1.htm)
        
        Note: To add aggregate expressions to a view extension, special rules apply. See below.
        
-   Aggregate expressions are possible in the SELECT list of a view extension only if the following conditions are met:
    -   The original view must contain [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm). If the original view does not contain any aggregate expressions, this is not possible.
    -   The extended view must be annotated with AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory \[#PROJECTION\_LIST, #GROUP\_BY\]
    -   If non-aggregated elements are added to a CDS view with aggregate expressions, then the [GROUP-BY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_group_by_v1.htm) clause must be extended using the addition GROUP BY
-   If the original view contains [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm), equivalent UNION additions must be used in the statement EXTEND VIEW. As a prerequisite, the extended view must be annotated with AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory \[#PROJECTION\_LIST, #UNION\]
    
    If an appended element already occurs in the existing SELECT list or if a different extension occurs, it must be given an alternative element name using AS.
    

Restrictions

-   CDS views with an explicit [name list](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_name_list_v1.htm) cannot currently be extended.
-   CDS view extensions themselves cannot be extended.
-   It is not possible to specify new input parameters in a view extension.
-   No addition [ROOT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_define_root_view_v1.htm) can be specified in the statement EXTEND VIEW to transform a regular view to a [root entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenroot_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
-   An appended field cannot be defined as a key field using KEY.
-   It is not allowed to define new to-parent or composition associations in a view extension.
-   For views that have an element of data type LRAW or LCHR in the SELECT list, no view extension is possible and the annotation AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory\[#NONE\] is enforced. The reason is that elements of data types LRAW or LCHR must always be in the last position of the SELECT list.

Naming

Two repository objects are created for a CDS view extension that is defined using EXTEND VIEW. A name must be specified for each of the two objects:

-   The actual name cds\_view\_extension of the CDS view extension is specified after the keywords EXTEND VIEW. This name follows the same rules as the name of an [DDIC append view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_append_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), but can have up to 30 characters.
-   The name CDS\_APPEND\_VIEW for an [append view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_append_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in ABAP Dictionary must be specified in quotation marks after the annotation [@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm). This name is subject to the same rules as the name of a [DDIC database view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abendatabase_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in ABAP Dictionary, see topic [DDIC - Naming Rules for DDIC Views](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_view_names.htm). The new DDIC append view extends the [CDS-managed DDIC view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_mngdddic_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the extended CDS view. The name given to the DDIC append view can no longer be changed after the CDS view extension is transported into a follow-on system.

The name of the new DDIC append view and of the actual CDS view extension should be located in the customer namespace (or in the namespace of a partner or special development) to protect it against being overwritten by upgrades or new releases.

-   Once the DDL source code of a CDS view extension has been transported, the actual name cds\_view\_extension and the name of the DDIC append view CDS\_APPEND\_VIEW can no longer be changed. The extended view ddic\_based\_view can also no longer be changed.

Note: The DDL source code of a CDS view extension does not need to have the same name as the CDS view extension entity, but it is advisable to use the name of the entity.

Hints

-   Currently it is not possible to define extension categories for CDS views. The following restrictions apply for this reason:
    -   CDS views have the property can be extended in any way with respect to the [extension category of DDIC structures](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_structures_enh_cat.htm). The consequences of this must be respected when extending a CDS view.
    -   The attributes of a CDS view defined using [annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_anno_v1.htm), such as switching on [table buffering](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abentable_buffering_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), cannot currently be modified using extensions.
-   CDS view extensions specified with EXTEND ENTITY are recommended for CDS DDIC-based views only. However, for compatibility and migration reasons, it is also possible to extend [CDS projection views](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_projection_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or [CDS view entities](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_v2_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") with the statement EXTEND VIEW. However, view extends defined using EXTEND VIEW don't support the syntax elements specific to projection views and CDS view entities. Therefore, it is recommended to use the statement [EXTEND VIEW ENTITY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_extend_view_entity.htm) for extensions of CDS projection views and CDS view entities instead.
-   If, for some reason, a CDS projection view or a CDS view entity is extended with EXTEND VIEW, the [CDS-managed DDIC view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_mngdddic_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is deleted (as CDS projection views and CDS view entities do not have any DDIC artefacts), and entity annotations referring to the CDS-managed DDIC view are ignored.

Example

The following CDS view extension

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_EXTENS'
extend view demo\_cds\_original\_view with demo\_cds\_view\_extension  
  {
    spfli.distance,
    spfli.distid as unit
  };

adds two view fields to the existing CDS view

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_ORIG'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
@AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory: \[#PROJECTION\_LIST\]
@EndUserText.label: 'Further information about the CDS entity'
define view demo\_cds\_original\_view  
  as select from
           spfli
      join scarr on
        scarr.carrid = spfli.carrid
    {
      key scarr.carrname     as carrier,
      key spfli.connid       as flight,
          spfli.cityfrom     as departure,
          spfli.cityto       as destination
    }; .

The DDIC append view DEMO\_CDS\_EXTENS is created in ABAP Dictionary. The program DEMO\_CDS\_VIEW\_EXTENSION uses the statement [SELECT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abapselect.htm) to access the enhanced view and also displays the components of the dictionary structures in question.

Addition 1   

... GROUP BY field1, field2, ...

Effect

This addition must be specified if elements not defined using aggregate expressions are added to a view with [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm). These elements must be specified after GROUP BY add extend the [GROUP-BY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_group_by_v1.htm) clause of the original view. With respect to the extended view, the extended GROUP-BY clause must follow the general rules for a GROUP-BY clause.

The addition cannot be specified if the definition of the original view does not contain any aggregate expressions in its SELECT list.

Hint

Extensions of a view with aggregate expressions require it to contain the annotation array viewEnhancementCategory\[ \] with the value #GROUP\_BY.

Example

The following CDS view extension

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_EXTAGG'
extend view demo\_cds\_aggregate with demo\_cds\_extend\_aggregate
  {
    connid,  
    sum(distance) as sum\_distance
  }
  group by
    connid;

extends the existing CDS view

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_AGG'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
@AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory: \[#PROJECTION\_LIST,#GROUP\_BY\]
define view demo\_cds\_aggregate
  as select from
    spfli  
    {
      carrid,
      sum(fltime) as sum\_fltime
    }
    group by
      carrid; .

A database field connid and an aggregate expression sum(distance) are added to the SELECT list. Accordingly, the addition GROUP BY must be used to add the database field to the GROUP-BY clause of the original view.

Addition 2   

... UNION *\[*ALL*\]* { ... }

Effect

This addition must be specified when a view with [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm) clauses is extended. A corresponding UNION addition must be specified for each UNION clause of the original view. The addition ALL must be specified each time it is specified in the associated UNION clause of the original view. The curly brackets can contain elements that extend the SELECT list of the associated UNION clause of the original view. As specified by the SELECT list extended using select\_list\_extension, the UNION clauses must be extended so that the rules for UNION clauses are not broken in the extended view.

The addition cannot be specified if the definition of the original view does not have a UNION clause.

Hint

Extensions of a view with UNION clauses require it to contain the annotation array viewEnhancementCategory\[ \] with the value #UNION.

Example

The following CDS view extension

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_EXTUNI'
extend view demo\_cds\_union with demo\_cds\_extend\_union
  {
    c as c3,
    d as c4
  }
union
  {
    f as c3,
    g as c4
  }
union all
  {
    k as c3,
    l as c4
  };

extends the existing CDS view

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_UIO'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
@AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory: \[#PROJECTION\_LIST,#UNION\]
define view demo\_cds\_union
  as select from
    demo\_join1
    {
      a as c1,
      b as c2
    }
union select from
  demo\_join2
    {
      d as c1,
      e as c2
    }
union all select from
  demo\_join3
    {
      i as c1,
      j as c2
    }; .

The original view has two UNION clauses represented using corresponding UNION additions in the definition of the CDS view extension. Two elements with matching types are added to the three SELECT lists of the original view.

Syntax

... @[annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_syntax.htm) ...

Effect

Specifies an [annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_syntax.htm) as an extension annotation in the definition of a [CDS view extension](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_extend_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") before the statement [EXTEND VIEW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_extend_view.htm). The character @ must be placed in front of the name annotation of the annotation. The annotation should be defined as a CDS object in a [CDS annotation definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_anno_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and the annotation definition annotation [@Scope](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_anno_annos.htm) should be specified here using the value #EXTEND\_VIEW.

The ABAP annotations are evaluated by the ABAP runtime framework for every CDS entity. Annotations with other identifiers are usually [framework-specific annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_frmwrk.htm). These are not evaluated by the ABAP runtime framework but by other SAP frameworks instead.

The first column of the table shows the (possibly structured) name annotation of an ABAP annotation and the second column shows its meaning. The third column shows the possible [annotation values](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenannotation_value_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The fourth column shows the default value which is used if the annotation is not used at all. The fifth column shows the default value set implicitly for value in accordance with the [annotation definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_anno_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") if the annotation is specified without a value. If nothing is specified for the annotation value, the annotation should be specified without a value.

Effect

Extends an existing [CDS DDIC-based view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_v1_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") ddic\_based\_view using a [CDS view extension](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_extend_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") cds\_view\_extension in the [CDS DDL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_ddl_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). An existing CDS DDIC-based view can have one or more CDS view extensions.

The extended CDS view ddic\_based\_view must be specified under the name of its [CDS entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The name of the [CDS-managed DDIC view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_mngdddic_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") cannot be specified.

Prerequisite

As a prerequisite for the enhancement of the CDS view with the statement EXTEND VIEW, the elements of the [annotation array](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenannotation_array_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory\[ \]](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_anno_v1.htm) must be specified accordingly in its definition with [DEFINE VIEW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_define_view_v1.htm):

-   By default or if only the value #PROJECTION\_LIST is specified, views without [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm) in the SELECT list and without a [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm) clause can be extended.
-   In order to extend views that have [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm) in the SELECT list, the annotation array must contain the value #GROUP\_BY alongside #PROJECTION\_LIST.
-   In order to extend views that contain [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm) clauses, the annotation array must contain the value #UNION alongside #PROJECTION\_LIST.
-   If the annotation array contains the value #NONE, the view cannot be extended.

Components of a view extension

View extensions can make additions to the original view, but it can't modify, overwrite, or delete elements from the original view. The following components are possible in a CDS view extension:

-   The annotation [AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm) is mandatory. Further annotations [extension\_annot1](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm), [extension\_annot2](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm), ... can also be specified. This is optional.
-   New associations association1, association2 can be defined and exposed in the CDS view extension. The same rules apply that are described in topic [CDS DDL - DDIC-based view, ASSOCIATION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_simple_association_v1.htm).
    
    Note: It is not allowed to define new [CDS compositions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_composition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or [CDS to-parent associations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abento_parent_association_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in a view extension.
    
-   The elements of the extension list select\_list\_extension specified after EXTEND VIEW are added to the existing SELECT list. At least one element must be added. It is possible to access all fields of all data sources of the extended view in the extension list select\_list\_extension. The list can have all [elements](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_entry_v1.htm) of a [SELECT list](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_v1.htm), namely:
    -   [field](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_field_v2.htm) of a data source
    -   [Input parameters](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_parameter_v1.htm) of the extended CDS view. It is not possible to specify new input parameters in a view extension.
    -   It can expose a [CDS association](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_association_v2.htm) of the extended view or a newly defined association
    -   Using a [path expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_path_expression_v1.htm), a field of an association target can be included. Path expressions are possible for associations of the extended view or for newly defined associations.
    -   [literals, session variables, expressions and functions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_operands_and_expr_v1.htm)
        
        Note: To add aggregate expressions to a view extension, special rules apply. See below.
        
-   Aggregate expressions are possible in the SELECT list of a view extension only if the following conditions are met:
    -   The original view must contain [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm). If the original view does not contain any aggregate expressions, this is not possible.
    -   The extended view must be annotated with AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory \[#PROJECTION\_LIST, #GROUP\_BY\]
    -   If non-aggregated elements are added to a CDS view with aggregate expressions, then the [GROUP-BY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_group_by_v1.htm) clause must be extended using the addition GROUP BY
-   If the original view contains [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm), equivalent UNION additions must be used in the statement EXTEND VIEW. As a prerequisite, the extended view must be annotated with AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory \[#PROJECTION\_LIST, #UNION\]
    
    If an appended element already occurs in the existing SELECT list or if a different extension occurs, it must be given an alternative element name using AS.
    

Restrictions

-   CDS views with an explicit [name list](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_name_list_v1.htm) cannot currently be extended.
-   CDS view extensions themselves cannot be extended.
-   It is not possible to specify new input parameters in a view extension.
-   No addition [ROOT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_define_root_view_v1.htm) can be specified in the statement EXTEND VIEW to transform a regular view to a [root entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenroot_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
-   An appended field cannot be defined as a key field using KEY.
-   It is not allowed to define new to-parent or composition associations in a view extension.
-   For views that have an element of data type LRAW or LCHR in the SELECT list, no view extension is possible and the annotation AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory\[#NONE\] is enforced. The reason is that elements of data types LRAW or LCHR must always be in the last position of the SELECT list.

Naming

Two repository objects are created for a CDS view extension that is defined using EXTEND VIEW. A name must be specified for each of the two objects:

-   The actual name cds\_view\_extension of the CDS view extension is specified after the keywords EXTEND VIEW. This name follows the same rules as the name of an [DDIC append view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_append_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), but can have up to 30 characters.
-   The name CDS\_APPEND\_VIEW for an [append view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_append_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in ABAP Dictionary must be specified in quotation marks after the annotation [@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm). This name is subject to the same rules as the name of a [DDIC database view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abendatabase_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in ABAP Dictionary, see topic [DDIC - Naming Rules for DDIC Views](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_view_names.htm). The new DDIC append view extends the [CDS-managed DDIC view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_mngdddic_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the extended CDS view. The name given to the DDIC append view can no longer be changed after the CDS view extension is transported into a follow-on system.

The name of the new DDIC append view and of the actual CDS view extension should be located in the customer namespace (or in the namespace of a partner or special development) to protect it against being overwritten by upgrades or new releases.

-   Once the DDL source code of a CDS view extension has been transported, the actual name cds\_view\_extension and the name of the DDIC append view CDS\_APPEND\_VIEW can no longer be changed. The extended view ddic\_based\_view can also no longer be changed.

Note: The DDL source code of a CDS view extension does not need to have the same name as the CDS view extension entity, but it is advisable to use the name of the entity.

Hints

-   Currently it is not possible to define extension categories for CDS views. The following restrictions apply for this reason:
    -   CDS views have the property can be extended in any way with respect to the [extension category of DDIC structures](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_structures_enh_cat.htm). The consequences of this must be respected when extending a CDS view.
    -   The attributes of a CDS view defined using [annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_anno_v1.htm), such as switching on [table buffering](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abentable_buffering_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), cannot currently be modified using extensions.
-   CDS view extensions specified with EXTEND ENTITY are recommended for CDS DDIC-based views only. However, for compatibility and migration reasons, it is also possible to extend [CDS projection views](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_projection_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or [CDS view entities](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_v2_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") with the statement EXTEND VIEW. However, view extends defined using EXTEND VIEW don't support the syntax elements specific to projection views and CDS view entities. Therefore, it is recommended to use the statement [EXTEND VIEW ENTITY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_extend_view_entity.htm) for extensions of CDS projection views and CDS view entities instead.
-   If, for some reason, a CDS projection view or a CDS view entity is extended with EXTEND VIEW, the [CDS-managed DDIC view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_mngdddic_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is deleted (as CDS projection views and CDS view entities do not have any DDIC artefacts), and entity annotations referring to the CDS-managed DDIC view are ignored.

Example

The following CDS view extension

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_EXTENS'
extend view demo\_cds\_original\_view with demo\_cds\_view\_extension  
  {
    spfli.distance,
    spfli.distid as unit
  };

adds two view fields to the existing CDS view

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_ORIG'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
@AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory: \[#PROJECTION\_LIST\]
@EndUserText.label: 'Further information about the CDS entity'
define view demo\_cds\_original\_view  
  as select from
           spfli
      join scarr on
        scarr.carrid = spfli.carrid
    {
      key scarr.carrname     as carrier,
      key spfli.connid       as flight,
          spfli.cityfrom     as departure,
          spfli.cityto       as destination
    }; .

The DDIC append view DEMO\_CDS\_EXTENS is created in ABAP Dictionary. The program DEMO\_CDS\_VIEW\_EXTENSION uses the statement [SELECT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abapselect.htm) to access the enhanced view and also displays the components of the dictionary structures in question.

Addition 1   

... GROUP BY field1, field2, ...

Effect

This addition must be specified if elements not defined using aggregate expressions are added to a view with [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm). These elements must be specified after GROUP BY add extend the [GROUP-BY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_group_by_v1.htm) clause of the original view. With respect to the extended view, the extended GROUP-BY clause must follow the general rules for a GROUP-BY clause.

The addition cannot be specified if the definition of the original view does not contain any aggregate expressions in its SELECT list.

Hint

Extensions of a view with aggregate expressions require it to contain the annotation array viewEnhancementCategory\[ \] with the value #GROUP\_BY.

Example

The following CDS view extension

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_EXTAGG'
extend view demo\_cds\_aggregate with demo\_cds\_extend\_aggregate
  {
    connid,  
    sum(distance) as sum\_distance
  }
  group by
    connid;

extends the existing CDS view

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_AGG'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
@AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory: \[#PROJECTION\_LIST,#GROUP\_BY\]
define view demo\_cds\_aggregate
  as select from
    spfli  
    {
      carrid,
      sum(fltime) as sum\_fltime
    }
    group by
      carrid; .

A database field connid and an aggregate expression sum(distance) are added to the SELECT list. Accordingly, the addition GROUP BY must be used to add the database field to the GROUP-BY clause of the original view.

Addition 2   

... UNION *\[*ALL*\]* { ... }

Effect

This addition must be specified when a view with [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm) clauses is extended. A corresponding UNION addition must be specified for each UNION clause of the original view. The addition ALL must be specified each time it is specified in the associated UNION clause of the original view. The curly brackets can contain elements that extend the SELECT list of the associated UNION clause of the original view. As specified by the SELECT list extended using select\_list\_extension, the UNION clauses must be extended so that the rules for UNION clauses are not broken in the extended view.

The addition cannot be specified if the definition of the original view does not have a UNION clause.

Hint

Extensions of a view with UNION clauses require it to contain the annotation array viewEnhancementCategory\[ \] with the value #UNION.

Example

The following CDS view extension

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_EXTUNI'
extend view demo\_cds\_union with demo\_cds\_extend\_union
  {
    c as c3,
    d as c4
  }
union
  {
    f as c3,
    g as c4
  }
union all
  {
    k as c3,
    l as c4
  };

extends the existing CDS view

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_UIO'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
@AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory: \[#PROJECTION\_LIST,#UNION\]
define view demo\_cds\_union
  as select from
    demo\_join1
    {
      a as c1,
      b as c2
    }
union select from
  demo\_join2
    {
      d as c1,
      e as c2
    }
union all select from
  demo\_join3
    {
      i as c1,
      j as c2
    }; .

The original view has two UNION clauses represented using corresponding UNION additions in the definition of the CDS view extension. Two elements with matching types are added to the three SELECT lists of the original view.

The annotation should be defined as a CDS object in a [CDS annotation definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_anno_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and the annotation definition annotation [@Scope](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_anno_annos.htm) should be specified here using the value #EXTEND\_VIEW.

The following tables show the possible [ABAP annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenabap_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that can be specified and their meanings. The ABAP annotations are evaluated by the ABAP runtime framework for every CDS entity. Annotations with other identifiers are usually [framework-specific annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_frmwrk.htm). These are not evaluated by the ABAP runtime framework but by other SAP frameworks instead.

The first column of the table shows the (possibly structured) name annotation of an ABAP annotation and the second column shows its meaning. The third column shows the possible [annotation values](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenannotation_value_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The fourth column shows the default value which is used if the annotation is not used at all. The fifth column shows the default value set implicitly for value in accordance with the [annotation definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_anno_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") if the annotation is specified without a value. If nothing is specified for the annotation value, the annotation should be specified without a value.

Effect

Extends an existing [CDS DDIC-based view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_v1_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") ddic\_based\_view using a [CDS view extension](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_extend_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") cds\_view\_extension in the [CDS DDL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_ddl_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). An existing CDS DDIC-based view can have one or more CDS view extensions.

The extended CDS view ddic\_based\_view must be specified under the name of its [CDS entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The name of the [CDS-managed DDIC view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_mngdddic_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") cannot be specified.

Prerequisite

As a prerequisite for the enhancement of the CDS view with the statement EXTEND VIEW, the elements of the [annotation array](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenannotation_array_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory\[ \]](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_anno_v1.htm) must be specified accordingly in its definition with [DEFINE VIEW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_define_view_v1.htm):

-   By default or if only the value #PROJECTION\_LIST is specified, views without [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm) in the SELECT list and without a [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm) clause can be extended.
-   In order to extend views that have [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm) in the SELECT list, the annotation array must contain the value #GROUP\_BY alongside #PROJECTION\_LIST.
-   In order to extend views that contain [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm) clauses, the annotation array must contain the value #UNION alongside #PROJECTION\_LIST.
-   If the annotation array contains the value #NONE, the view cannot be extended.

Components of a view extension

View extensions can make additions to the original view, but it can't modify, overwrite, or delete elements from the original view. The following components are possible in a CDS view extension:

-   The annotation [AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm) is mandatory. Further annotations [extension\_annot1](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm), [extension\_annot2](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm), ... can also be specified. This is optional.
-   New associations association1, association2 can be defined and exposed in the CDS view extension. The same rules apply that are described in topic [CDS DDL - DDIC-based view, ASSOCIATION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_simple_association_v1.htm).
    
    Note: It is not allowed to define new [CDS compositions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_composition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or [CDS to-parent associations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abento_parent_association_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in a view extension.
    
-   The elements of the extension list select\_list\_extension specified after EXTEND VIEW are added to the existing SELECT list. At least one element must be added. It is possible to access all fields of all data sources of the extended view in the extension list select\_list\_extension. The list can have all [elements](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_entry_v1.htm) of a [SELECT list](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_v1.htm), namely:
    -   [field](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_field_v2.htm) of a data source
    -   [Input parameters](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_parameter_v1.htm) of the extended CDS view. It is not possible to specify new input parameters in a view extension.
    -   It can expose a [CDS association](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_association_v2.htm) of the extended view or a newly defined association
    -   Using a [path expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_path_expression_v1.htm), a field of an association target can be included. Path expressions are possible for associations of the extended view or for newly defined associations.
    -   [literals, session variables, expressions and functions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_operands_and_expr_v1.htm)
        
        Note: To add aggregate expressions to a view extension, special rules apply. See below.
        
-   Aggregate expressions are possible in the SELECT list of a view extension only if the following conditions are met:
    -   The original view must contain [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm). If the original view does not contain any aggregate expressions, this is not possible.
    -   The extended view must be annotated with AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory \[#PROJECTION\_LIST, #GROUP\_BY\]
    -   If non-aggregated elements are added to a CDS view with aggregate expressions, then the [GROUP-BY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_group_by_v1.htm) clause must be extended using the addition GROUP BY
-   If the original view contains [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm), equivalent UNION additions must be used in the statement EXTEND VIEW. As a prerequisite, the extended view must be annotated with AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory \[#PROJECTION\_LIST, #UNION\]
    
    If an appended element already occurs in the existing SELECT list or if a different extension occurs, it must be given an alternative element name using AS.
    

Restrictions

-   CDS views with an explicit [name list](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_name_list_v1.htm) cannot currently be extended.
-   CDS view extensions themselves cannot be extended.
-   It is not possible to specify new input parameters in a view extension.
-   No addition [ROOT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_define_root_view_v1.htm) can be specified in the statement EXTEND VIEW to transform a regular view to a [root entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenroot_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
-   An appended field cannot be defined as a key field using KEY.
-   It is not allowed to define new to-parent or composition associations in a view extension.
-   For views that have an element of data type LRAW or LCHR in the SELECT list, no view extension is possible and the annotation AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory\[#NONE\] is enforced. The reason is that elements of data types LRAW or LCHR must always be in the last position of the SELECT list.

Naming

Two repository objects are created for a CDS view extension that is defined using EXTEND VIEW. A name must be specified for each of the two objects:

-   The actual name cds\_view\_extension of the CDS view extension is specified after the keywords EXTEND VIEW. This name follows the same rules as the name of an [DDIC append view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_append_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), but can have up to 30 characters.
-   The name CDS\_APPEND\_VIEW for an [append view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_append_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in ABAP Dictionary must be specified in quotation marks after the annotation [@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm). This name is subject to the same rules as the name of a [DDIC database view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abendatabase_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in ABAP Dictionary, see topic [DDIC - Naming Rules for DDIC Views](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_view_names.htm). The new DDIC append view extends the [CDS-managed DDIC view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_mngdddic_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the extended CDS view. The name given to the DDIC append view can no longer be changed after the CDS view extension is transported into a follow-on system.

The name of the new DDIC append view and of the actual CDS view extension should be located in the customer namespace (or in the namespace of a partner or special development) to protect it against being overwritten by upgrades or new releases.

-   Once the DDL source code of a CDS view extension has been transported, the actual name cds\_view\_extension and the name of the DDIC append view CDS\_APPEND\_VIEW can no longer be changed. The extended view ddic\_based\_view can also no longer be changed.

Note: The DDL source code of a CDS view extension does not need to have the same name as the CDS view extension entity, but it is advisable to use the name of the entity.

Hints

-   Currently it is not possible to define extension categories for CDS views. The following restrictions apply for this reason:
    -   CDS views have the property can be extended in any way with respect to the [extension category of DDIC structures](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_structures_enh_cat.htm). The consequences of this must be respected when extending a CDS view.
    -   The attributes of a CDS view defined using [annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_anno_v1.htm), such as switching on [table buffering](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abentable_buffering_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), cannot currently be modified using extensions.
-   CDS view extensions specified with EXTEND ENTITY are recommended for CDS DDIC-based views only. However, for compatibility and migration reasons, it is also possible to extend [CDS projection views](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_projection_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or [CDS view entities](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_v2_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") with the statement EXTEND VIEW. However, view extends defined using EXTEND VIEW don't support the syntax elements specific to projection views and CDS view entities. Therefore, it is recommended to use the statement [EXTEND VIEW ENTITY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_extend_view_entity.htm) for extensions of CDS projection views and CDS view entities instead.
-   If, for some reason, a CDS projection view or a CDS view entity is extended with EXTEND VIEW, the [CDS-managed DDIC view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_mngdddic_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is deleted (as CDS projection views and CDS view entities do not have any DDIC artefacts), and entity annotations referring to the CDS-managed DDIC view are ignored.

Example

The following CDS view extension

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_EXTENS'
extend view demo\_cds\_original\_view with demo\_cds\_view\_extension  
  {
    spfli.distance,
    spfli.distid as unit
  };

adds two view fields to the existing CDS view

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_ORIG'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
@AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory: \[#PROJECTION\_LIST\]
@EndUserText.label: 'Further information about the CDS entity'
define view demo\_cds\_original\_view  
  as select from
           spfli
      join scarr on
        scarr.carrid = spfli.carrid
    {
      key scarr.carrname     as carrier,
      key spfli.connid       as flight,
          spfli.cityfrom     as departure,
          spfli.cityto       as destination
    }; .

The DDIC append view DEMO\_CDS\_EXTENS is created in ABAP Dictionary. The program DEMO\_CDS\_VIEW\_EXTENSION uses the statement [SELECT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abapselect.htm) to access the enhanced view and also displays the components of the dictionary structures in question.

Addition 1   

... GROUP BY field1, field2, ...

Effect

This addition must be specified if elements not defined using aggregate expressions are added to a view with [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm). These elements must be specified after GROUP BY add extend the [GROUP-BY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_group_by_v1.htm) clause of the original view. With respect to the extended view, the extended GROUP-BY clause must follow the general rules for a GROUP-BY clause.

The addition cannot be specified if the definition of the original view does not contain any aggregate expressions in its SELECT list.

Hint

Extensions of a view with aggregate expressions require it to contain the annotation array viewEnhancementCategory\[ \] with the value #GROUP\_BY.

Example

The following CDS view extension

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_EXTAGG'
extend view demo\_cds\_aggregate with demo\_cds\_extend\_aggregate
  {
    connid,  
    sum(distance) as sum\_distance
  }
  group by
    connid;

extends the existing CDS view

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_AGG'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
@AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory: \[#PROJECTION\_LIST,#GROUP\_BY\]
define view demo\_cds\_aggregate
  as select from
    spfli  
    {
      carrid,
      sum(fltime) as sum\_fltime
    }
    group by
      carrid; .

A database field connid and an aggregate expression sum(distance) are added to the SELECT list. Accordingly, the addition GROUP BY must be used to add the database field to the GROUP-BY clause of the original view.

Addition 2   

... UNION *\[*ALL*\]* { ... }

Effect

This addition must be specified when a view with [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm) clauses is extended. A corresponding UNION addition must be specified for each UNION clause of the original view. The addition ALL must be specified each time it is specified in the associated UNION clause of the original view. The curly brackets can contain elements that extend the SELECT list of the associated UNION clause of the original view. As specified by the SELECT list extended using select\_list\_extension, the UNION clauses must be extended so that the rules for UNION clauses are not broken in the extended view.

The addition cannot be specified if the definition of the original view does not have a UNION clause.

Hint

Extensions of a view with UNION clauses require it to contain the annotation array viewEnhancementCategory\[ \] with the value #UNION.

Example

The following CDS view extension

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_EXTUNI'
extend view demo\_cds\_union with demo\_cds\_extend\_union
  {
    c as c3,
    d as c4
  }
union
  {
    f as c3,
    g as c4
  }
union all
  {
    k as c3,
    l as c4
  };

extends the existing CDS view

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_UIO'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
@AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory: \[#PROJECTION\_LIST,#UNION\]
define view demo\_cds\_union
  as select from
    demo\_join1
    {
      a as c1,
      b as c2
    }
union select from
  demo\_join2
    {
      d as c1,
      e as c2
    }
union all select from
  demo\_join3
    {
      i as c1,
      j as c2
    }; .

The original view has two UNION clauses represented using corresponding UNION additions in the definition of the CDS view extension. Two elements with matching types are added to the three SELECT lists of the original view.

Specifies an [annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_syntax.htm) as an extension annotation in the definition of a [CDS view extension](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_extend_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") before the statement [EXTEND VIEW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_extend_view.htm). The character @ must be placed in front of the name annotation of the annotation. The annotation should be defined as a CDS object in a [CDS annotation definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_anno_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and the annotation definition annotation [@Scope](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_anno_annos.htm) should be specified here using the value #EXTEND\_VIEW.

The following tables show the possible [ABAP annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenabap_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that can be specified and their meanings. The ABAP annotations are evaluated by the ABAP runtime framework for every CDS entity. Annotations with other identifiers are usually [framework-specific annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_frmwrk.htm). These are not evaluated by the ABAP runtime framework but by other SAP frameworks instead.

The first column of the table shows the (possibly structured) name annotation of an ABAP annotation and the second column shows its meaning. The third column shows the possible [annotation values](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenannotation_value_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The fourth column shows the default value which is used if the annotation is not used at all. The fifth column shows the default value set implicitly for value in accordance with the [annotation definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_anno_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") if the annotation is specified without a value. If nothing is specified for the annotation value, the annotation should be specified without a value.

Effect

Extends an existing [CDS DDIC-based view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_v1_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") ddic\_based\_view using a [CDS view extension](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_extend_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") cds\_view\_extension in the [CDS DDL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_ddl_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). An existing CDS DDIC-based view can have one or more CDS view extensions.

The extended CDS view ddic\_based\_view must be specified under the name of its [CDS entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The name of the [CDS-managed DDIC view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_mngdddic_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") cannot be specified.

Prerequisite

As a prerequisite for the enhancement of the CDS view with the statement EXTEND VIEW, the elements of the [annotation array](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenannotation_array_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory\[ \]](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_anno_v1.htm) must be specified accordingly in its definition with [DEFINE VIEW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_define_view_v1.htm):

-   By default or if only the value #PROJECTION\_LIST is specified, views without [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm) in the SELECT list and without a [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm) clause can be extended.
-   In order to extend views that have [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm) in the SELECT list, the annotation array must contain the value #GROUP\_BY alongside #PROJECTION\_LIST.
-   In order to extend views that contain [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm) clauses, the annotation array must contain the value #UNION alongside #PROJECTION\_LIST.
-   If the annotation array contains the value #NONE, the view cannot be extended.

Components of a view extension

View extensions can make additions to the original view, but it can't modify, overwrite, or delete elements from the original view. The following components are possible in a CDS view extension:

-   The annotation [AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm) is mandatory. Further annotations [extension\_annot1](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm), [extension\_annot2](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm), ... can also be specified. This is optional.
-   New associations association1, association2 can be defined and exposed in the CDS view extension. The same rules apply that are described in topic [CDS DDL - DDIC-based view, ASSOCIATION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_simple_association_v1.htm).
    
    Note: It is not allowed to define new [CDS compositions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_composition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or [CDS to-parent associations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abento_parent_association_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in a view extension.
    
-   The elements of the extension list select\_list\_extension specified after EXTEND VIEW are added to the existing SELECT list. At least one element must be added. It is possible to access all fields of all data sources of the extended view in the extension list select\_list\_extension. The list can have all [elements](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_entry_v1.htm) of a [SELECT list](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_v1.htm), namely:
    -   [field](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_field_v2.htm) of a data source
    -   [Input parameters](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_parameter_v1.htm) of the extended CDS view. It is not possible to specify new input parameters in a view extension.
    -   It can expose a [CDS association](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_select_list_association_v2.htm) of the extended view or a newly defined association
    -   Using a [path expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_path_expression_v1.htm), a field of an association target can be included. Path expressions are possible for associations of the extended view or for newly defined associations.
    -   [literals, session variables, expressions and functions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_operands_and_expr_v1.htm)
        
        Note: To add aggregate expressions to a view extension, special rules apply. See below.
        
-   Aggregate expressions are possible in the SELECT list of a view extension only if the following conditions are met:
    -   The original view must contain [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm). If the original view does not contain any aggregate expressions, this is not possible.
    -   The extended view must be annotated with AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory \[#PROJECTION\_LIST, #GROUP\_BY\]
    -   If non-aggregated elements are added to a CDS view with aggregate expressions, then the [GROUP-BY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_group_by_v1.htm) clause must be extended using the addition GROUP BY
-   If the original view contains [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm), equivalent UNION additions must be used in the statement EXTEND VIEW. As a prerequisite, the extended view must be annotated with AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory \[#PROJECTION\_LIST, #UNION\]
    
    If an appended element already occurs in the existing SELECT list or if a different extension occurs, it must be given an alternative element name using AS.
    

Restrictions

-   CDS views with an explicit [name list](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_name_list_v1.htm) cannot currently be extended.
-   CDS view extensions themselves cannot be extended.
-   It is not possible to specify new input parameters in a view extension.
-   No addition [ROOT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_define_root_view_v1.htm) can be specified in the statement EXTEND VIEW to transform a regular view to a [root entity](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenroot_entity_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
-   An appended field cannot be defined as a key field using KEY.
-   It is not allowed to define new to-parent or composition associations in a view extension.
-   For views that have an element of data type LRAW or LCHR in the SELECT list, no view extension is possible and the annotation AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory\[#NONE\] is enforced. The reason is that elements of data types LRAW or LCHR must always be in the last position of the SELECT list.

Naming

Two repository objects are created for a CDS view extension that is defined using EXTEND VIEW. A name must be specified for each of the two objects:

-   The actual name cds\_view\_extension of the CDS view extension is specified after the keywords EXTEND VIEW. This name follows the same rules as the name of an [DDIC append view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_append_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), but can have up to 30 characters.
-   The name CDS\_APPEND\_VIEW for an [append view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_append_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in ABAP Dictionary must be specified in quotation marks after the annotation [@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_extend_view_annotations.htm). This name is subject to the same rules as the name of a [DDIC database view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abendatabase_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in ABAP Dictionary, see topic [DDIC - Naming Rules for DDIC Views](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_view_names.htm). The new DDIC append view extends the [CDS-managed DDIC view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_mngdddic_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of the extended CDS view. The name given to the DDIC append view can no longer be changed after the CDS view extension is transported into a follow-on system.

The name of the new DDIC append view and of the actual CDS view extension should be located in the customer namespace (or in the namespace of a partner or special development) to protect it against being overwritten by upgrades or new releases.

-   Once the DDL source code of a CDS view extension has been transported, the actual name cds\_view\_extension and the name of the DDIC append view CDS\_APPEND\_VIEW can no longer be changed. The extended view ddic\_based\_view can also no longer be changed.

Note: The DDL source code of a CDS view extension does not need to have the same name as the CDS view extension entity, but it is advisable to use the name of the entity.

Hints

-   Currently it is not possible to define extension categories for CDS views. The following restrictions apply for this reason:
    -   CDS views have the property can be extended in any way with respect to the [extension category of DDIC structures](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenddic_structures_enh_cat.htm). The consequences of this must be respected when extending a CDS view.
    -   The attributes of a CDS view defined using [annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_anno_v1.htm), such as switching on [table buffering](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abentable_buffering_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), cannot currently be modified using extensions.
-   CDS view extensions specified with EXTEND ENTITY are recommended for CDS DDIC-based views only. However, for compatibility and migration reasons, it is also possible to extend [CDS projection views](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_projection_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or [CDS view entities](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_v2_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") with the statement EXTEND VIEW. However, view extends defined using EXTEND VIEW don't support the syntax elements specific to projection views and CDS view entities. Therefore, it is recommended to use the statement [EXTEND VIEW ENTITY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_extend_view_entity.htm) for extensions of CDS projection views and CDS view entities instead.
-   If, for some reason, a CDS projection view or a CDS view entity is extended with EXTEND VIEW, the [CDS-managed DDIC view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_mngdddic_view_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is deleted (as CDS projection views and CDS view entities do not have any DDIC artefacts), and entity annotations referring to the CDS-managed DDIC view are ignored.

Example

The following CDS view extension

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_EXTENS'
extend view demo\_cds\_original\_view with demo\_cds\_view\_extension  
  {
    spfli.distance,
    spfli.distid as unit
  };

adds two view fields to the existing CDS view

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_ORIG'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
@AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory: \[#PROJECTION\_LIST\]
@EndUserText.label: 'Further information about the CDS entity'
define view demo\_cds\_original\_view  
  as select from
           spfli
      join scarr on
        scarr.carrid = spfli.carrid
    {
      key scarr.carrname     as carrier,
      key spfli.connid       as flight,
          spfli.cityfrom     as departure,
          spfli.cityto       as destination
    }; .

The DDIC append view DEMO\_CDS\_EXTENS is created in ABAP Dictionary. The program DEMO\_CDS\_VIEW\_EXTENSION uses the statement [SELECT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abapselect.htm) to access the enhanced view and also displays the components of the dictionary structures in question.

Addition 1   

... GROUP BY field1, field2, ...

Effect

This addition must be specified if elements not defined using aggregate expressions are added to a view with [aggregate expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_aggregate_functions_v1.htm). These elements must be specified after GROUP BY add extend the [GROUP-BY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_group_by_v1.htm) clause of the original view. With respect to the extended view, the extended GROUP-BY clause must follow the general rules for a GROUP-BY clause.

The addition cannot be specified if the definition of the original view does not contain any aggregate expressions in its SELECT list.

Hint

Extensions of a view with aggregate expressions require it to contain the annotation array viewEnhancementCategory\[ \] with the value #GROUP\_BY.

Example

The following CDS view extension

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_EXTAGG'
extend view demo\_cds\_aggregate with demo\_cds\_extend\_aggregate
  {
    connid,  
    sum(distance) as sum\_distance
  }
  group by
    connid;

extends the existing CDS view

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_AGG'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
@AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory: \[#PROJECTION\_LIST,#GROUP\_BY\]
define view demo\_cds\_aggregate
  as select from
    spfli  
    {
      carrid,
      sum(fltime) as sum\_fltime
    }
    group by
      carrid; .

A database field connid and an aggregate expression sum(distance) are added to the SELECT list. Accordingly, the addition GROUP BY must be used to add the database field to the GROUP-BY clause of the original view.

Addition 2   

... UNION *\[*ALL*\]* { ... }

Effect

This addition must be specified when a view with [UNION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_union_v1.htm) clauses is extended. A corresponding UNION addition must be specified for each UNION clause of the original view. The addition ALL must be specified each time it is specified in the associated UNION clause of the original view. The curly brackets can contain elements that extend the SELECT list of the associated UNION clause of the original view. As specified by the SELECT list extended using select\_list\_extension, the UNION clauses must be extended so that the rules for UNION clauses are not broken in the extended view.

The addition cannot be specified if the definition of the original view does not have a UNION clause.

Hint

Extensions of a view with UNION clauses require it to contain the annotation array viewEnhancementCategory\[ \] with the value #UNION.

Example

The following CDS view extension

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewAppendName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_EXTUNI'
extend view demo\_cds\_union with demo\_cds\_extend\_union
  {
    c as c3,
    d as c4
  }
union
  {
    f as c3,
    g as c4
  }
union all
  {
    k as c3,
    l as c4
  };

extends the existing CDS view

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMO\_CDS\_UIO'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT\_REQUIRED
@AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory: \[#PROJECTION\_LIST,#UNION\]
define view demo\_cds\_union
  as select from
    demo\_join1
    {
      a as c1,
      b as c2
    }
union select from
  demo\_join2
    {
      d as c1,
      e as c2
    }
union all select from
  demo\_join3
    {
      i as c1,
      j as c2
    }; .

The original view has two UNION clauses represented using corresponding UNION additions in the definition of the CDS view extension. Two elements with matching types are added to the three SELECT lists of the original view.

Specifies an [annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_syntax.htm) as an extension annotation in the definition of a [CDS view extension](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_view_extend_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") before the statement [EXTEND VIEW](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_extend_view.htm). The character @ must be placed in front of the name annotation of the annotation. The annotation should be defined as a CDS object in a [CDS annotation definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_anno_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and the annotation definition annotation [@Scope](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_anno_annos.htm) should be specified here using the value #EXTEND\_VIEW.

The following tables show the possible [ABAP annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenabap_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that can be specified and their meanings. The ABAP annotations are evaluated by the ABAP runtime framework for every CDS entity. Annotations with other identifiers are usually [framework-specific annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_frmwrk.htm). These are not evaluated by the ABAP runtime framework but by other SAP frameworks instead.

The first column of the table shows the (possibly structured) name annotation of an ABAP annotation and the second column shows its meaning. The third column shows the possible [annotation values](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenannotation_value_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The fourth column shows the default value which is used if the annotation is not used at all. The fifth column shows the default value set implicitly for value in accordance with the [annotation definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_anno_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") if the annotation is specified without a value. If nothing is specified for the annotation value, the annotation should be specified without a value.

Effect

Defines a [CDS access policy](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_access_policy_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") access\_policy in the [CDS DCL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_dcl_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") to be used as a medium for further definitions.

An ACCESSPOLICY contains the definition of one of the following objects (which must have the same name as the access policy):

-   A [PFCG mapping](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_pfcg_mapping_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [DEFINE PFCG\_MAPPING](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_pfcg_mapping.htm)
-   A self-defined aspect [DEFINE ASPECT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_generic_aspect.htm).

DEFINE ACCESSPOLICY can be used to specify the optional annotation [@access\_policy\_annot](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_dcl_ap_annotations.htm) in front of the actual definition of the access policy.

Hints

-   Separate [DCL source code](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abendcl_source_code_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") must be created for each CDS access policy.

Effect

Defines a [PFCG mapping](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_pfcg_mapping_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") pfcg\_mapping as part of a [CDS access policy](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_access_policy_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") defined using [DEFINE ACCESSPOLICY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_accesspolicy.htm). The name of the PFCG mapping must match the name of the CDS access policy.

The definition of a PCFG mapping contains the following:

-   A comma-separated list after the name pfcg\_mapping in which the output fields of the PFCG mapping are defined. These fields must be elements of the CDS entity mapping\_entity specified after BETWEEN. The specified order is relevant.
-   A CDS entity mapping\_entity specified after the keyword BETWEEN to define the fields used in the mapping. This definition specifies the input and output fields of the mapping.
-   An [authorization object](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenauthorization_object_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") auth\_object specified after the keyword AND. The PFCG mapping can be [used](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_cond_pfcg_mapping.htm) in exactly those [PFCG conditions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_cond_pfcg.htm) in which this authorization object is specified after ASPECT pfcg\_auth.
-   A comma-separated unordered list in curly brackets that associates the input fields input1, input2, ... of the mapping with [authorization fields](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenauthorization_field_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") auth\_field of the authorization object auth\_object.
    -   The input fields on the left sides must be elements of the CDS entity mapping\_entity specified after BETWEEN.
    -   Authorization fields of the authorization object auth\_object must be specified on the right sides.
    -   Any number of optional assignments can be flagged using the addition CONSTRAINT ID.

A PFCG mapping can be [used](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_cond_pfcg_mapping.htm) in a [PFCG](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_cond_pfcg.htm) condition of the same authorization object. It is transformed to specific access conditions as follows when the condition is evaluated:

-   The values of the current user for the authorization fields assigned to the input fields fill the input fields of the mapping.
-   The output fields of the mapping are assigned to the elements within the [curly brackets](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_cond_pfcg_mapping.htm) of the PFCG condition in the specified order.
-   The following applies to the input fields flagged with CONSTRAINT ID:
    -   Only those authorization fields of the authorization object can be assigned that contain a single value in a specific authorization. Multiple values or patterns are not allowed (with the exception of full authorization using the value "\*"). Otherwise the PFCG mapping in the PFCG condition returns the value "false" for the authorization in question.
    -   Full authorization can be assigned only when applied to all input fields of the PFCG mapping.
-   If full authorization exists for all input fields of the PFCG mapping (value "\*"), the PFCG mapping in the PFCG condition returns the value "true" when evaluated. This makes it possible to read entries of the protected entity for which there are no output fields in the mapping.

Addition   

... IN SCENARIO

Effect

To use a PFCG mapping in a PFCG condition where the authorization object is subject to the switchable authorization check, the PFCG mapping must also name the same scenario (as well as the same authorization object). For more information, see the [PFCG condition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_cond_pfcg.htm) of the statement DEFINE ROLE.

Hint

In ABAP SQL access to a CDS entity assigned a role of this type, PFCG mappings are defined internally using a subquery after EXISTS.

Example

The following example shows the definition of a PFCG mapping demo\_cds\_auth\_pfcg\_mapping based on the CDS entity demo\_cds\_mapping\_entity below. The output fields of the PFCG mapping are the authorization fields OBJECT, OBJ\_NAME, and DEVCLASS of the authorization object S\_DEVELOP. The input fields of the PFCG mapping are the elements of the CDS entity to which the output fields are assigned. The [example](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_cond_pfcg_mapping.htm) that demonstrates how a PFCG mapping is specified in a role shows how the mapping is used.

-   PFCG Mapping
    
    define accesspolicy demo\_cds\_pfcg\_mapping  {
      define pfcg\_mapping demo\_cds\_pfcg\_mapping( map\_object,  
                                                 map\_obj\_name,  
                                                 map\_devclass )
        between demo\_cds\_mapping\_entity
          and S\_DEVELOP
          { map\_devclass = devclass,
            map\_object   = objtype,
            map\_obj\_name = objname } }
    
-   CDS Entity
    
    @AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMOCDSMAPPENT'
    define view demo\_cds\_mapping\_entity
      as select from
        tadir
        {
          devclass as map\_devclass,
          object   as map\_object,
          obj\_name as map\_obj\_name
        }
        where
              devclass =    'SABAPDEMOS'
          and object   =    'PROG'
          and obj\_name like 'DEMO%'

Effect

Defines a [PFCG mapping](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_pfcg_mapping_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") pfcg\_mapping as part of a [CDS access policy](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_access_policy_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") defined using [DEFINE ACCESSPOLICY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_accesspolicy.htm). The name of the PFCG mapping must match the name of the CDS access policy.

The definition of a PCFG mapping contains the following:

-   A comma-separated list after the name pfcg\_mapping in which the output fields of the PFCG mapping are defined. These fields must be elements of the CDS entity mapping\_entity specified after BETWEEN. The specified order is relevant.
-   A CDS entity mapping\_entity specified after the keyword BETWEEN to define the fields used in the mapping. This definition specifies the input and output fields of the mapping.
-   An [authorization object](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenauthorization_object_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") auth\_object specified after the keyword AND. The PFCG mapping can be [used](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_cond_pfcg_mapping.htm) in exactly those [PFCG conditions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_cond_pfcg.htm) in which this authorization object is specified after ASPECT pfcg\_auth.
-   A comma-separated unordered list in curly brackets that associates the input fields input1, input2, ... of the mapping with [authorization fields](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenauthorization_field_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") auth\_field of the authorization object auth\_object.
    -   The input fields on the left sides must be elements of the CDS entity mapping\_entity specified after BETWEEN.
    -   Authorization fields of the authorization object auth\_object must be specified on the right sides.
    -   Any number of optional assignments can be flagged using the addition CONSTRAINT ID.

A PFCG mapping can be [used](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_cond_pfcg_mapping.htm) in a [PFCG](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_cond_pfcg.htm) condition of the same authorization object. It is transformed to specific access conditions as follows when the condition is evaluated:

-   The values of the current user for the authorization fields assigned to the input fields fill the input fields of the mapping.
-   The output fields of the mapping are assigned to the elements within the [curly brackets](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_cond_pfcg_mapping.htm) of the PFCG condition in the specified order.
-   The following applies to the input fields flagged with CONSTRAINT ID:
    -   Only those authorization fields of the authorization object can be assigned that contain a single value in a specific authorization. Multiple values or patterns are not allowed (with the exception of full authorization using the value "\*"). Otherwise the PFCG mapping in the PFCG condition returns the value "false" for the authorization in question.
    -   Full authorization can be assigned only when applied to all input fields of the PFCG mapping.
-   If full authorization exists for all input fields of the PFCG mapping (value "\*"), the PFCG mapping in the PFCG condition returns the value "true" when evaluated. This makes it possible to read entries of the protected entity for which there are no output fields in the mapping.

Addition   

... IN SCENARIO

Effect

To use a PFCG mapping in a PFCG condition where the authorization object is subject to the switchable authorization check, the PFCG mapping must also name the same scenario (as well as the same authorization object). For more information, see the [PFCG condition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_cond_pfcg.htm) of the statement DEFINE ROLE.

Hint

In ABAP SQL access to a CDS entity assigned a role of this type, PFCG mappings are defined internally using a subquery after EXISTS.

Example

The following example shows the definition of a PFCG mapping demo\_cds\_auth\_pfcg\_mapping based on the CDS entity demo\_cds\_mapping\_entity below. The output fields of the PFCG mapping are the authorization fields OBJECT, OBJ\_NAME, and DEVCLASS of the authorization object S\_DEVELOP. The input fields of the PFCG mapping are the elements of the CDS entity to which the output fields are assigned. The [example](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_cond_pfcg_mapping.htm) that demonstrates how a PFCG mapping is specified in a role shows how the mapping is used.

-   PFCG Mapping
    
    define accesspolicy demo\_cds\_pfcg\_mapping  {
      define pfcg\_mapping demo\_cds\_pfcg\_mapping( map\_object,  
                                                 map\_obj\_name,  
                                                 map\_devclass )
        between demo\_cds\_mapping\_entity
          and S\_DEVELOP
          { map\_devclass = devclass,
            map\_object   = objtype,
            map\_obj\_name = objname } }
    
-   CDS Entity
    
    @AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'DEMOCDSMAPPENT'
    define view demo\_cds\_mapping\_entity
      as select from
        tadir
        {
          devclass as map\_devclass,
          object   as map\_object,
          obj\_name as map\_obj\_name
        }
        where
              devclass =    'SABAPDEMOS'
          and object   =    'PROG'
          and obj\_name like 'DEMO%'

        filter\_element2... ) *\]*
{
    output1 *\[*BYPASS WHEN aspect\_bypass\_condition*\]*
    *\[*, ... *\]*
}

Effect

Defines a self-defined aspect aspect as part of a [CDS access policy](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_access_policy_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") defined using [DEFINE ACCESSPOLICY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_accesspolicy.htm). The name of the self-defined aspect must be the same as the name of the CDS access policy.

The definition of a self-defined aspect contains the following:

-   An aspect entity aspect\_entity, specified after the name aspect, which is used as a data source.
-   An element user\_element of the aspect entity that is used as the input field for the user name of the logged on user.
-   An optional list of elements filter\_element of the aspect entity. With filter elements the rows of the aspect entity can be reduced specifically for a usage location in an access role ( ( ...) = ASPECT ... FILTER BY condition>). Filter elements are addressed in the filter condition using the last component of their path expression, optionally an alias can be specified by the AS addition. Adding filter elements is a compatible change from the perspective of access roles using the aspect, that is, they offer a filtering possibility, but do not mandate that filtering is in fact done.
-   A comma-separated list that specifies the output elements output1, output2, ... of the generic aspect. The specified order applies.
-   Any number of the output fields can be tagged with a condition using the addition BYPASS WHEN aspect\_bypass\_condition. Typical bypass values are \* or an empty value.

The following are possible as bypass conditions aspect\_bypass\_condition:

-   [IS *\[*NOT*\]* NULL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_cond_expr_null_v2.htm)
-   [IS *\[*NOT*\]* INITIAL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_cond_expr_initial_v2.htm)
-   IS INITIAL OR NULL
    
    Is met if the value of the aspect is NULL or the type-compliant initial value.
    
-   \= [literal](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_literal_v2.htm)

At runtime, the field user\_element is filled with the user name of the current user. The rows produced in the aspect entity are matched with their output fields in the specified order and with the elements on the left side of the access condition to which the self-defined aspect is assigned. This means those rows in the protected entity meet the condition for which a row exists for the current user in the aspect entity.

When the bypass condition is used, the match with this field is not used if this condition exists in a row of the aspect entity. A specified value, therefore, (such as an asterisk \*) can be used to indicate that any values of the protected entity are allowed.

Special Requirements in the Aspect Entity

The content of the aspect entity has a particular relevance for audits by being used in a self-defined aspect in access control.

To determine which user had access to particular data at a particular time in a system, it must be possible to reconstruct the state of the data of the aspect entity. Existing mechanisms (such as version management or change documents) cover this requirement in the case of development objects or PFCG roles, whereas aspect entities may freely specify their data sources and cannot control whether these sources are themselves auditable.

The development and runtime systems for CDS access control cannot check whether data sources are auditable. To emphasize this requirement, however, the aspect entity must have the following annotations:

-   An auditing type with the annotation @AccessControl.auditing.type. Currently only the value #CUSTOM is possible.
-   A component with the annotation @AccessControl.auditing.specification specifying (as text) how the content of the entity is audited.

Hints

-   Just adding the annotations, however, does not activate auditing. This annotation should only be set if it is ensured that auditing takes place.
-   Auditing must respect all data sources of the aspect entity.
-   If auditing cannot be ensured, the aspect entity cannot be used in a self-defined aspect.
-   In ABAP SQL access to a CDS entity assigned a role of this type, self-defined aspects are defined internally using a [subquery](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abensubquery_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") after EXISTS.

Currently only the value #CUSTOM is possible.
-   A component with the annotation @AccessControl.auditing.specification specifying (as text) how the content of the entity is audited.

Hints

-   Just adding the annotations, however, does not activate auditing. This annotation should only be set if it is ensured that auditing takes place.
-   Auditing must respect all data sources of the aspect entity.
-   If auditing cannot be ensured, the aspect entity cannot be used in a self-defined aspect.
-   In ABAP SQL access to a CDS entity assigned a role of this type, self-defined aspects are defined internally using a [subquery](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abensubquery_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") after EXISTS.

}

Effect

Defines a [CDS access policy](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_access_policy_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") access\_policy in the [CDS DCL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_dcl_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") to be used as a medium for further definitions.

An ACCESSPOLICY contains the definition of one of the following objects (which must have the same name as the access policy):

-   A [PFCG mapping](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_pfcg_mapping_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [DEFINE PFCG\_MAPPING](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_pfcg_mapping.htm)
-   A self-defined aspect [DEFINE ASPECT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_generic_aspect.htm).

DEFINE ACCESSPOLICY can be used to specify the optional annotation [@access\_policy\_annot](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_dcl_ap_annotations.htm) in front of the actual definition of the access policy.

Hints

-   Separate [DCL source code](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abendcl_source_code_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") must be created for each CDS access policy.
-   The [DCL source code](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abendcl_source_code_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of a CDS access policy must have the same name as this policy.

Effect

Specifies an [annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_syntax.htm) as an access policy annotation in the definition of a [CDS access policy](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_access_policy_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in front of the statement [DEFINE ACCESSPOLICY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_accesspolicy.htm). The character @ must be placed directly in front of the name annotation of the annotation.

The table below shows the possible [ABAP annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenabap_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that can be specified, and their meanings. No other annotations can be specified.

The first column of the table shows the (possibly structured) name annotation of an ABAP annotation and the second column shows its meaning. The third column shows the possible [annotation values](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenannotation_value_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The fourth column shows the default value which is used if the annotation is not used at all. The fifth column shows the default value set implicitly for value in accordance with the [annotation definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_anno_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") if the annotation is specified without a value. If nothing is specified for the annotation value, the annotation should be specified without a value.

Hint

The EndUserText.label annotation is not recommended for CDS access policies, since its value is overwritten by the identically named annotation of the [PFCG mapping](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_dcl_pm_annotations.htm) or [aspect](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_dcl_as_annotations.htm) in question.

This means that the short text for these objects should be entered here directly and not in the CDS access policy.

[... IN SCENARIO](#!ABAP_ONE_ADD@1@)

Effect

Defines a [PFCG mapping](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_pfcg_mapping_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") pfcg\_mapping as part of a [CDS access policy](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_access_policy_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") defined using [DEFINE ACCESSPOLICY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_accesspolicy.htm). The name of the PFCG mapping must match the name of the CDS access policy.

The definition of a PCFG mapping contains the following:

-   A comma-separated list after the name pfcg\_mapping in which the output fields of the PFCG mapping are defined. These fields must be elements of the CDS entity mapping\_entity specified after BETWEEN. The specified order is relevant.
-   A CDS entity mapping\_entity specified after the keyword BETWEEN to define the fields used in the mapping. This definition specifies the input and output fields of the mapping.
-   An [authorization object](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenauthorization_object_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") auth\_object specified after the keyword AND. The PFCG mapping can be [used](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_cond_pfcg_mapping.htm) in exactly those [PFCG conditions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_cond_pfcg.htm) in which this authorization object is specified after ASPECT pfcg\_auth.
-   A comma-separated unordered list in curly brackets that associates the input fields input1, input2, ... of the mapping with [authorization fields](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenauthorization_field_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") auth\_field of the authorization object auth\_object.
    -   The input fields on the left sides must be elements of the CDS entity mapping\_entity specified after BETWEEN.
    -   Authorization fields of the authorization object auth\_object must be specified on the right sides.
    -   Any number of optional assignments can be flagged using the addition CONSTRAINT ID.

A PFCG mapping can be [used](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_cond_pfcg_mapping.htm) in a [PFCG](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_cond_pfcg.htm) condition of the same authorization object. It is transformed to specific access conditions as follows when the condition is evaluated:

-   The values of the current user for the authorization fields assigned to the input fields fill the input fields of the mapping.
-   The output fields of the mapping are assigned to the elements within the [curly brackets](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_cond_pfcg_mapping.htm) of the PFCG condition in the specified order.
-   The following applies to the input fields flagged with CONSTRAINT ID:
    -   Only those authorization fields of the authorization object can be assigned that contain a single value in a specific authorization. Multiple values or patterns are not allowed (with the exception of full authorization using the value "\*"). Otherwise the PFCG mapping in the PFCG condition returns the value "false" for the authorization in question.
    -   Full authorization can be assigned only when applied to all input fields of the PFCG mapping.
-   If full authorization exists for all input fields of the PFCG mapping (value "\*"), the PFCG mapping in the PFCG condition returns the value "true" when evaluated. This makes it possible to read entries of the protected entity for which there are no output fields in the mapping.

Addition   

... IN SCENARIO

Effect

To use a PFCG mapping in a PFCG condition where the authorization object is subject to the switchable authorization check, the PFCG mapping must also name the same scenario (as well as the same authorization object). For more information, see the [PFCG condition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_cond_pfcg.htm) of the statement DEFINE ROLE.

Hint

In ABAP SQL access to a CDS entity assigned a role of this type, PFCG mappings are defined internally using a subquery after EXISTS.

Example

The following example shows the definition of a PFCG mapping demo\_cds\_auth\_pfcg\_mapping based on the CDS entity demo\_cds\_mapping\_entity below. The output fields of the PFCG mapping are the authorization fields OBJECT, OBJ\_NAME, and DEVCLASS of the authorization object S\_DEVELOP. The input fields of the PFCG mapping are the elements of the CDS entity to which the output fields are assigned. The [example](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_cond_pfcg_mapping.htm) that demonstrates how a PFCG mapping is specified in a role shows how the mapping is used.

Effect

Defines a [PFCG mapping](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_pfcg_mapping_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") pfcg\_mapping as part of a [CDS access policy](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_access_policy_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") defined using [DEFINE ACCESSPOLICY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_accesspolicy.htm). The name of the PFCG mapping must match the name of the CDS access policy.

The definition of a PCFG mapping contains the following:

-   A comma-separated list after the name pfcg\_mapping in which the output fields of the PFCG mapping are defined. These fields must be elements of the CDS entity mapping\_entity specified after BETWEEN. The specified order is relevant.
-   A CDS entity mapping\_entity specified after the keyword BETWEEN to define the fields used in the mapping. This definition specifies the input and output fields of the mapping.
-   An [authorization object](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenauthorization_object_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") auth\_object specified after the keyword AND. The PFCG mapping can be [used](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_cond_pfcg_mapping.htm) in exactly those [PFCG conditions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_cond_pfcg.htm) in which this authorization object is specified after ASPECT pfcg\_auth.
-   A comma-separated unordered list in curly brackets that associates the input fields input1, input2, ... of the mapping with [authorization fields](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenauthorization_field_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") auth\_field of the authorization object auth\_object.
    -   The input fields on the left sides must be elements of the CDS entity mapping\_entity specified after BETWEEN.
    -   Authorization fields of the authorization object auth\_object must be specified on the right sides.
    -   Any number of optional assignments can be flagged using the addition CONSTRAINT ID.

A PFCG mapping can be [used](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_cond_pfcg_mapping.htm) in a [PFCG](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_cond_pfcg.htm) condition of the same authorization object. It is transformed to specific access conditions as follows when the condition is evaluated:

-   The values of the current user for the authorization fields assigned to the input fields fill the input fields of the mapping.
-   The output fields of the mapping are assigned to the elements within the [curly brackets](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_cond_pfcg_mapping.htm) of the PFCG condition in the specified order.
-   The following applies to the input fields flagged with CONSTRAINT ID:
    -   Only those authorization fields of the authorization object can be assigned that contain a single value in a specific authorization. Multiple values or patterns are not allowed (with the exception of full authorization using the value "\*"). Otherwise the PFCG mapping in the PFCG condition returns the value "false" for the authorization in question.
    -   Full authorization can be assigned only when applied to all input fields of the PFCG mapping.
-   If full authorization exists for all input fields of the PFCG mapping (value "\*"), the PFCG mapping in the PFCG condition returns the value "true" when evaluated. This makes it possible to read entries of the protected entity for which there are no output fields in the mapping.

Addition   

... IN SCENARIO

Effect

To use a PFCG mapping in a PFCG condition where the authorization object is subject to the switchable authorization check, the PFCG mapping must also name the same scenario (as well as the same authorization object). For more information, see the [PFCG condition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_cond_pfcg.htm) of the statement DEFINE ROLE.

Hint

In ABAP SQL access to a CDS entity assigned a role of this type, PFCG mappings are defined internally using a subquery after EXISTS.

Example

The following example shows the definition of a PFCG mapping demo\_cds\_auth\_pfcg\_mapping based on the CDS entity demo\_cds\_mapping\_entity below. The output fields of the PFCG mapping are the authorization fields OBJECT, OBJ\_NAME, and DEVCLASS of the authorization object S\_DEVELOP. The input fields of the PFCG mapping are the elements of the CDS entity to which the output fields are assigned. The [example](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_cond_pfcg_mapping.htm) that demonstrates how a PFCG mapping is specified in a role shows how the mapping is used.

{
    output1 *\[*BYPASS WHEN aspect\_bypass\_condition*\]*
    *\[*, ... *\]*
}

Effect

Defines a self-defined aspect aspect as part of a [CDS access policy](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_access_policy_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") defined using [DEFINE ACCESSPOLICY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_accesspolicy.htm). The name of the self-defined aspect must be the same as the name of the CDS access policy.

The definition of a self-defined aspect contains the following:

-   An aspect entity aspect\_entity, specified after the name aspect, which is used as a data source.
-   An element user\_element of the aspect entity that is used as the input field for the user name of the logged on user.
-   An optional list of elements filter\_element of the aspect entity. With filter elements the rows of the aspect entity can be reduced specifically for a usage location in an access role ( ( ...) = ASPECT ... FILTER BY condition>). Filter elements are addressed in the filter condition using the last component of their path expression, optionally an alias can be specified by the AS addition. Adding filter elements is a compatible change from the perspective of access roles using the aspect, that is, they offer a filtering possibility, but do not mandate that filtering is in fact done.
-   A comma-separated list that specifies the output elements output1, output2, ... of the generic aspect. The specified order applies.
-   Any number of the output fields can be tagged with a condition using the addition BYPASS WHEN aspect\_bypass\_condition. Typical bypass values are \* or an empty value.

The following are possible as bypass conditions aspect\_bypass\_condition:

-   [IS *\[*NOT*\]* NULL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_cond_expr_null_v2.htm)
-   [IS *\[*NOT*\]* INITIAL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_cond_expr_initial_v2.htm)
-   IS INITIAL OR NULL
    
    Is met if the value of the aspect is NULL or the type-compliant initial value.
    
-   \= [literal](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_literal_v2.htm)

At runtime, the field user\_element is filled with the user name of the current user. The rows produced in the aspect entity are matched with their output fields in the specified order and with the elements on the left side of the access condition to which the self-defined aspect is assigned. This means those rows in the protected entity meet the condition for which a row exists for the current user in the aspect entity.

When the bypass condition is used, the match with this field is not used if this condition exists in a row of the aspect entity. A specified value, therefore, (such as an asterisk \*) can be used to indicate that any values of the protected entity are allowed.

Special Requirements in the Aspect Entity

The content of the aspect entity has a particular relevance for audits by being used in a self-defined aspect in access control.

To determine which user had access to particular data at a particular time in a system, it must be possible to reconstruct the state of the data of the aspect entity. Existing mechanisms (such as version management or change documents) cover this requirement in the case of development objects or PFCG roles, whereas aspect entities may freely specify their data sources and cannot control whether these sources are themselves auditable.

The development and runtime systems for CDS access control cannot check whether data sources are auditable. To emphasize this requirement, however, the aspect entity must have the following annotations:

-   An auditing type with the annotation @AccessControl.auditing.type. Currently only the value #CUSTOM is possible.
-   A component with the annotation @AccessControl.auditing.specification specifying (as text) how the content of the entity is audited.

Hints

-   Just adding the annotations, however, does not activate auditing. This annotation should only be set if it is ensured that auditing takes place.
-   Auditing must respect all data sources of the aspect entity.
-   If auditing cannot be ensured, the aspect entity cannot be used in a self-defined aspect.
-   In ABAP SQL access to a CDS entity assigned a role of this type, self-defined aspects are defined internally using a [subquery](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abensubquery_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") after EXISTS.

Currently only the value #CUSTOM is possible.
-   A component with the annotation @AccessControl.auditing.specification specifying (as text) how the content of the entity is audited.

Hints

-   Just adding the annotations, however, does not activate auditing. This annotation should only be set if it is ensured that auditing takes place.
-   Auditing must respect all data sources of the aspect entity.
-   If auditing cannot be ensured, the aspect entity cannot be used in a self-defined aspect.
-   In ABAP SQL access to a CDS entity assigned a role of this type, self-defined aspects are defined internally using a [subquery](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abensubquery_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") after EXISTS.

}

Effect

Defines a [CDS access policy](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_access_policy_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") access\_policy in the [CDS DCL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_dcl_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") to be used as a medium for further definitions.

An ACCESSPOLICY contains the definition of one of the following objects (which must have the same name as the access policy):

-   A [PFCG mapping](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_pfcg_mapping_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [DEFINE PFCG\_MAPPING](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_pfcg_mapping.htm)
-   A self-defined aspect [DEFINE ASPECT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_generic_aspect.htm).

DEFINE ACCESSPOLICY can be used to specify the optional annotation [@access\_policy\_annot](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_dcl_ap_annotations.htm) in front of the actual definition of the access policy.

Hints

-   Separate [DCL source code](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abendcl_source_code_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") must be created for each CDS access policy.
-   The [DCL source code](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abendcl_source_code_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of a CDS access policy must have the same name as this policy.

Effect

Specifies an [annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_syntax.htm) as an access policy annotation in the definition of a [CDS access policy](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_access_policy_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in front of the statement [DEFINE ACCESSPOLICY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_accesspolicy.htm). The character @ must be placed directly in front of the name annotation of the annotation.

The table below shows the possible [ABAP annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenabap_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that can be specified, and their meanings. No other annotations can be specified.

The first column of the table shows the (possibly structured) name annotation of an ABAP annotation and the second column shows its meaning. The third column shows the possible [annotation values](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenannotation_value_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The fourth column shows the default value which is used if the annotation is not used at all. The fifth column shows the default value set implicitly for value in accordance with the [annotation definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_anno_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") if the annotation is specified without a value. If nothing is specified for the annotation value, the annotation should be specified without a value.

Hint

The EndUserText.label annotation is not recommended for CDS access policies, since its value is overwritten by the identically named annotation of the [PFCG mapping](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_dcl_pm_annotations.htm) or [aspect](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_dcl_as_annotations.htm) in question.

This means that the short text for these objects should be entered here directly and not in the CDS access policy.

[... IN SCENARIO](#!ABAP_ONE_ADD@1@)

Effect

Defines a [PFCG mapping](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_pfcg_mapping_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") pfcg\_mapping as part of a [CDS access policy](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_access_policy_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") defined using [DEFINE ACCESSPOLICY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_accesspolicy.htm). The name of the PFCG mapping must match the name of the CDS access policy.

The definition of a PCFG mapping contains the following:

-   A comma-separated list after the name pfcg\_mapping in which the output fields of the PFCG mapping are defined. These fields must be elements of the CDS entity mapping\_entity specified after BETWEEN. The specified order is relevant.
-   A CDS entity mapping\_entity specified after the keyword BETWEEN to define the fields used in the mapping. This definition specifies the input and output fields of the mapping.
-   An [authorization object](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenauthorization_object_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") auth\_object specified after the keyword AND. The PFCG mapping can be [used](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_cond_pfcg_mapping.htm) in exactly those [PFCG conditions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_cond_pfcg.htm) in which this authorization object is specified after ASPECT pfcg\_auth.
-   A comma-separated unordered list in curly brackets that associates the input fields input1, input2, ... of the mapping with [authorization fields](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenauthorization_field_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") auth\_field of the authorization object auth\_object.
    -   The input fields on the left sides must be elements of the CDS entity mapping\_entity specified after BETWEEN.
    -   Authorization fields of the authorization object auth\_object must be specified on the right sides.
    -   Any number of optional assignments can be flagged using the addition CONSTRAINT ID.

A PFCG mapping can be [used](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_cond_pfcg_mapping.htm) in a [PFCG](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_cond_pfcg.htm) condition of the same authorization object. It is transformed to specific access conditions as follows when the condition is evaluated:

-   The values of the current user for the authorization fields assigned to the input fields fill the input fields of the mapping.
-   The output fields of the mapping are assigned to the elements within the [curly brackets](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_cond_pfcg_mapping.htm) of the PFCG condition in the specified order.
-   The following applies to the input fields flagged with CONSTRAINT ID:
    -   Only those authorization fields of the authorization object can be assigned that contain a single value in a specific authorization. Multiple values or patterns are not allowed (with the exception of full authorization using the value "\*"). Otherwise the PFCG mapping in the PFCG condition returns the value "false" for the authorization in question.
    -   Full authorization can be assigned only when applied to all input fields of the PFCG mapping.
-   If full authorization exists for all input fields of the PFCG mapping (value "\*"), the PFCG mapping in the PFCG condition returns the value "true" when evaluated. This makes it possible to read entries of the protected entity for which there are no output fields in the mapping.

Addition   

... IN SCENARIO

Effect

To use a PFCG mapping in a PFCG condition where the authorization object is subject to the switchable authorization check, the PFCG mapping must also name the same scenario (as well as the same authorization object). For more information, see the [PFCG condition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_cond_pfcg.htm) of the statement DEFINE ROLE.

Hint

In ABAP SQL access to a CDS entity assigned a role of this type, PFCG mappings are defined internally using a subquery after EXISTS.

Example

The following example shows the definition of a PFCG mapping demo\_cds\_auth\_pfcg\_mapping based on the CDS entity demo\_cds\_mapping\_entity below. The output fields of the PFCG mapping are the authorization fields OBJECT, OBJ\_NAME, and DEVCLASS of the authorization object S\_DEVELOP. The input fields of the PFCG mapping are the elements of the CDS entity to which the output fields are assigned. The [example](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_cond_pfcg_mapping.htm) that demonstrates how a PFCG mapping is specified in a role shows how the mapping is used.

Effect

Defines a [PFCG mapping](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_pfcg_mapping_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") pfcg\_mapping as part of a [CDS access policy](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_access_policy_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") defined using [DEFINE ACCESSPOLICY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_accesspolicy.htm). The name of the PFCG mapping must match the name of the CDS access policy.

The definition of a PCFG mapping contains the following:

-   A comma-separated list after the name pfcg\_mapping in which the output fields of the PFCG mapping are defined. These fields must be elements of the CDS entity mapping\_entity specified after BETWEEN. The specified order is relevant.
-   A CDS entity mapping\_entity specified after the keyword BETWEEN to define the fields used in the mapping. This definition specifies the input and output fields of the mapping.
-   An [authorization object](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenauthorization_object_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") auth\_object specified after the keyword AND. The PFCG mapping can be [used](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_cond_pfcg_mapping.htm) in exactly those [PFCG conditions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_cond_pfcg.htm) in which this authorization object is specified after ASPECT pfcg\_auth.
-   A comma-separated unordered list in curly brackets that associates the input fields input1, input2, ... of the mapping with [authorization fields](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenauthorization_field_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") auth\_field of the authorization object auth\_object.
    -   The input fields on the left sides must be elements of the CDS entity mapping\_entity specified after BETWEEN.
    -   Authorization fields of the authorization object auth\_object must be specified on the right sides.
    -   Any number of optional assignments can be flagged using the addition CONSTRAINT ID.

A PFCG mapping can be [used](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_cond_pfcg_mapping.htm) in a [PFCG](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_cond_pfcg.htm) condition of the same authorization object. It is transformed to specific access conditions as follows when the condition is evaluated:

-   The values of the current user for the authorization fields assigned to the input fields fill the input fields of the mapping.
-   The output fields of the mapping are assigned to the elements within the [curly brackets](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_cond_pfcg_mapping.htm) of the PFCG condition in the specified order.
-   The following applies to the input fields flagged with CONSTRAINT ID:
    -   Only those authorization fields of the authorization object can be assigned that contain a single value in a specific authorization. Multiple values or patterns are not allowed (with the exception of full authorization using the value "\*"). Otherwise the PFCG mapping in the PFCG condition returns the value "false" for the authorization in question.
    -   Full authorization can be assigned only when applied to all input fields of the PFCG mapping.
-   If full authorization exists for all input fields of the PFCG mapping (value "\*"), the PFCG mapping in the PFCG condition returns the value "true" when evaluated. This makes it possible to read entries of the protected entity for which there are no output fields in the mapping.

Addition   

... IN SCENARIO

Effect

To use a PFCG mapping in a PFCG condition where the authorization object is subject to the switchable authorization check, the PFCG mapping must also name the same scenario (as well as the same authorization object). For more information, see the [PFCG condition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_cond_pfcg.htm) of the statement DEFINE ROLE.

Hint

In ABAP SQL access to a CDS entity assigned a role of this type, PFCG mappings are defined internally using a subquery after EXISTS.

Example

The following example shows the definition of a PFCG mapping demo\_cds\_auth\_pfcg\_mapping based on the CDS entity demo\_cds\_mapping\_entity below. The output fields of the PFCG mapping are the authorization fields OBJECT, OBJ\_NAME, and DEVCLASS of the authorization object S\_DEVELOP. The input fields of the PFCG mapping are the elements of the CDS entity to which the output fields are assigned. The [example](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_cond_pfcg_mapping.htm) that demonstrates how a PFCG mapping is specified in a role shows how the mapping is used.

{
    output1 *\[*BYPASS WHEN aspect\_bypass\_condition*\]*
    *\[*, ... *\]*
}

Effect

Defines a self-defined aspect aspect as part of a [CDS access policy](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_access_policy_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") defined using [DEFINE ACCESSPOLICY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_accesspolicy.htm). The name of the self-defined aspect must be the same as the name of the CDS access policy.

The definition of a self-defined aspect contains the following:

-   An aspect entity aspect\_entity, specified after the name aspect, which is used as a data source.
-   An element user\_element of the aspect entity that is used as the input field for the user name of the logged on user.
-   An optional list of elements filter\_element of the aspect entity. With filter elements the rows of the aspect entity can be reduced specifically for a usage location in an access role ( ( ...) = ASPECT ... FILTER BY condition>). Filter elements are addressed in the filter condition using the last component of their path expression, optionally an alias can be specified by the AS addition. Adding filter elements is a compatible change from the perspective of access roles using the aspect, that is, they offer a filtering possibility, but do not mandate that filtering is in fact done.
-   A comma-separated list that specifies the output elements output1, output2, ... of the generic aspect. The specified order applies.
-   Any number of the output fields can be tagged with a condition using the addition BYPASS WHEN aspect\_bypass\_condition. Typical bypass values are \* or an empty value.

The following are possible as bypass conditions aspect\_bypass\_condition:

-   [IS *\[*NOT*\]* NULL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_cond_expr_null_v2.htm)
-   [IS *\[*NOT*\]* INITIAL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_cond_expr_initial_v2.htm)
-   IS INITIAL OR NULL
    
    Is met if the value of the aspect is NULL or the type-compliant initial value.
    
-   \= [literal](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_literal_v2.htm)

At runtime, the field user\_element is filled with the user name of the current user. The rows produced in the aspect entity are matched with their output fields in the specified order and with the elements on the left side of the access condition to which the self-defined aspect is assigned. This means those rows in the protected entity meet the condition for which a row exists for the current user in the aspect entity.

When the bypass condition is used, the match with this field is not used if this condition exists in a row of the aspect entity. A specified value, therefore, (such as an asterisk \*) can be used to indicate that any values of the protected entity are allowed.

Special Requirements in the Aspect Entity

The content of the aspect entity has a particular relevance for audits by being used in a self-defined aspect in access control.

To determine which user had access to particular data at a particular time in a system, it must be possible to reconstruct the state of the data of the aspect entity. Existing mechanisms (such as version management or change documents) cover this requirement in the case of development objects or PFCG roles, whereas aspect entities may freely specify their data sources and cannot control whether these sources are themselves auditable.

The development and runtime systems for CDS access control cannot check whether data sources are auditable. To emphasize this requirement, however, the aspect entity must have the following annotations:

-   An auditing type with the annotation @AccessControl.auditing.type. Currently only the value #CUSTOM is possible.
-   A component with the annotation @AccessControl.auditing.specification specifying (as text) how the content of the entity is audited.

Hints

-   Just adding the annotations, however, does not activate auditing. This annotation should only be set if it is ensured that auditing takes place.
-   Auditing must respect all data sources of the aspect entity.
-   If auditing cannot be ensured, the aspect entity cannot be used in a self-defined aspect.
-   In ABAP SQL access to a CDS entity assigned a role of this type, self-defined aspects are defined internally using a [subquery](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abensubquery_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") after EXISTS.

Currently only the value #CUSTOM is possible.
-   A component with the annotation @AccessControl.auditing.specification specifying (as text) how the content of the entity is audited.

Hints

-   Just adding the annotations, however, does not activate auditing. This annotation should only be set if it is ensured that auditing takes place.
-   Auditing must respect all data sources of the aspect entity.
-   If auditing cannot be ensured, the aspect entity cannot be used in a self-defined aspect.
-   In ABAP SQL access to a CDS entity assigned a role of this type, self-defined aspects are defined internally using a [subquery](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abensubquery_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") after EXISTS.

}

Effect

Defines a [CDS access policy](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_access_policy_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") access\_policy in the [CDS DCL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_dcl_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") to be used as a medium for further definitions.

An ACCESSPOLICY contains the definition of one of the following objects (which must have the same name as the access policy):

-   A [PFCG mapping](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_pfcg_mapping_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [DEFINE PFCG\_MAPPING](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_pfcg_mapping.htm)
-   A self-defined aspect [DEFINE ASPECT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_generic_aspect.htm).

DEFINE ACCESSPOLICY can be used to specify the optional annotation [@access\_policy\_annot](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_dcl_ap_annotations.htm) in front of the actual definition of the access policy.

Hints

-   Separate [DCL source code](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abendcl_source_code_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") must be created for each CDS access policy.
-   The [DCL source code](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abendcl_source_code_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of a CDS access policy must have the same name as this policy.

Effect

Specifies an [annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_syntax.htm) as an access policy annotation in the definition of a [CDS access policy](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_access_policy_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in front of the statement [DEFINE ACCESSPOLICY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_accesspolicy.htm). The character @ must be placed directly in front of the name annotation of the annotation.

The table below shows the possible [ABAP annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenabap_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that can be specified, and their meanings. No other annotations can be specified.

The first column of the table shows the (possibly structured) name annotation of an ABAP annotation and the second column shows its meaning. The third column shows the possible [annotation values](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenannotation_value_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The fourth column shows the default value which is used if the annotation is not used at all. The fifth column shows the default value set implicitly for value in accordance with the [annotation definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_anno_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") if the annotation is specified without a value. If nothing is specified for the annotation value, the annotation should be specified without a value.

Hint

The EndUserText.label annotation is not recommended for CDS access policies, since its value is overwritten by the identically named annotation of the [PFCG mapping](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_dcl_pm_annotations.htm) or [aspect](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_dcl_as_annotations.htm) in question.

This means that the short text for these objects should be entered here directly and not in the CDS access policy.

[... IN SCENARIO](#!ABAP_ONE_ADD@1@)

Effect

Defines a [PFCG mapping](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_pfcg_mapping_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") pfcg\_mapping as part of a [CDS access policy](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_access_policy_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") defined using [DEFINE ACCESSPOLICY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_accesspolicy.htm). The name of the PFCG mapping must match the name of the CDS access policy.

The definition of a PCFG mapping contains the following:

-   A comma-separated list after the name pfcg\_mapping in which the output fields of the PFCG mapping are defined. These fields must be elements of the CDS entity mapping\_entity specified after BETWEEN. The specified order is relevant.
-   A CDS entity mapping\_entity specified after the keyword BETWEEN to define the fields used in the mapping. This definition specifies the input and output fields of the mapping.
-   An [authorization object](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenauthorization_object_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") auth\_object specified after the keyword AND. The PFCG mapping can be [used](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_cond_pfcg_mapping.htm) in exactly those [PFCG conditions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_cond_pfcg.htm) in which this authorization object is specified after ASPECT pfcg\_auth.
-   A comma-separated unordered list in curly brackets that associates the input fields input1, input2, ... of the mapping with [authorization fields](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenauthorization_field_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") auth\_field of the authorization object auth\_object.
    -   The input fields on the left sides must be elements of the CDS entity mapping\_entity specified after BETWEEN.
    -   Authorization fields of the authorization object auth\_object must be specified on the right sides.
    -   Any number of optional assignments can be flagged using the addition CONSTRAINT ID.

A PFCG mapping can be [used](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_cond_pfcg_mapping.htm) in a [PFCG](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_cond_pfcg.htm) condition of the same authorization object. It is transformed to specific access conditions as follows when the condition is evaluated:

-   The values of the current user for the authorization fields assigned to the input fields fill the input fields of the mapping.
-   The output fields of the mapping are assigned to the elements within the [curly brackets](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_cond_pfcg_mapping.htm) of the PFCG condition in the specified order.
-   The following applies to the input fields flagged with CONSTRAINT ID:
    -   Only those authorization fields of the authorization object can be assigned that contain a single value in a specific authorization. Multiple values or patterns are not allowed (with the exception of full authorization using the value "\*"). Otherwise the PFCG mapping in the PFCG condition returns the value "false" for the authorization in question.
    -   Full authorization can be assigned only when applied to all input fields of the PFCG mapping.
-   If full authorization exists for all input fields of the PFCG mapping (value "\*"), the PFCG mapping in the PFCG condition returns the value "true" when evaluated. This makes it possible to read entries of the protected entity for which there are no output fields in the mapping.

Addition   

... IN SCENARIO

Effect

To use a PFCG mapping in a PFCG condition where the authorization object is subject to the switchable authorization check, the PFCG mapping must also name the same scenario (as well as the same authorization object). For more information, see the [PFCG condition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_cond_pfcg.htm) of the statement DEFINE ROLE.

Hint

In ABAP SQL access to a CDS entity assigned a role of this type, PFCG mappings are defined internally using a subquery after EXISTS.

Example

The following example shows the definition of a PFCG mapping demo\_cds\_auth\_pfcg\_mapping based on the CDS entity demo\_cds\_mapping\_entity below. The output fields of the PFCG mapping are the authorization fields OBJECT, OBJ\_NAME, and DEVCLASS of the authorization object S\_DEVELOP. The input fields of the PFCG mapping are the elements of the CDS entity to which the output fields are assigned. The [example](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_cond_pfcg_mapping.htm) that demonstrates how a PFCG mapping is specified in a role shows how the mapping is used.

Effect

Defines a [PFCG mapping](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_pfcg_mapping_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") pfcg\_mapping as part of a [CDS access policy](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_access_policy_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") defined using [DEFINE ACCESSPOLICY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_accesspolicy.htm). The name of the PFCG mapping must match the name of the CDS access policy.

The definition of a PCFG mapping contains the following:

-   A comma-separated list after the name pfcg\_mapping in which the output fields of the PFCG mapping are defined. These fields must be elements of the CDS entity mapping\_entity specified after BETWEEN. The specified order is relevant.
-   A CDS entity mapping\_entity specified after the keyword BETWEEN to define the fields used in the mapping. This definition specifies the input and output fields of the mapping.
-   An [authorization object](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenauthorization_object_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") auth\_object specified after the keyword AND. The PFCG mapping can be [used](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_cond_pfcg_mapping.htm) in exactly those [PFCG conditions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_cond_pfcg.htm) in which this authorization object is specified after ASPECT pfcg\_auth.
-   A comma-separated unordered list in curly brackets that associates the input fields input1, input2, ... of the mapping with [authorization fields](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenauthorization_field_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") auth\_field of the authorization object auth\_object.
    -   The input fields on the left sides must be elements of the CDS entity mapping\_entity specified after BETWEEN.
    -   Authorization fields of the authorization object auth\_object must be specified on the right sides.
    -   Any number of optional assignments can be flagged using the addition CONSTRAINT ID.

A PFCG mapping can be [used](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_cond_pfcg_mapping.htm) in a [PFCG](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_cond_pfcg.htm) condition of the same authorization object. It is transformed to specific access conditions as follows when the condition is evaluated:

-   The values of the current user for the authorization fields assigned to the input fields fill the input fields of the mapping.
-   The output fields of the mapping are assigned to the elements within the [curly brackets](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_cond_pfcg_mapping.htm) of the PFCG condition in the specified order.
-   The following applies to the input fields flagged with CONSTRAINT ID:
    -   Only those authorization fields of the authorization object can be assigned that contain a single value in a specific authorization. Multiple values or patterns are not allowed (with the exception of full authorization using the value "\*"). Otherwise the PFCG mapping in the PFCG condition returns the value "false" for the authorization in question.
    -   Full authorization can be assigned only when applied to all input fields of the PFCG mapping.
-   If full authorization exists for all input fields of the PFCG mapping (value "\*"), the PFCG mapping in the PFCG condition returns the value "true" when evaluated. This makes it possible to read entries of the protected entity for which there are no output fields in the mapping.

Addition   

... IN SCENARIO

Effect

To use a PFCG mapping in a PFCG condition where the authorization object is subject to the switchable authorization check, the PFCG mapping must also name the same scenario (as well as the same authorization object). For more information, see the [PFCG condition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_cond_pfcg.htm) of the statement DEFINE ROLE.

Hint

In ABAP SQL access to a CDS entity assigned a role of this type, PFCG mappings are defined internally using a subquery after EXISTS.

Example

The following example shows the definition of a PFCG mapping demo\_cds\_auth\_pfcg\_mapping based on the CDS entity demo\_cds\_mapping\_entity below. The output fields of the PFCG mapping are the authorization fields OBJECT, OBJ\_NAME, and DEVCLASS of the authorization object S\_DEVELOP. The input fields of the PFCG mapping are the elements of the CDS entity to which the output fields are assigned. The [example](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_cond_pfcg_mapping.htm) that demonstrates how a PFCG mapping is specified in a role shows how the mapping is used.

{
    output1 *\[*BYPASS WHEN aspect\_bypass\_condition*\]*
    *\[*, ... *\]*
}

Effect

Defines a self-defined aspect aspect as part of a [CDS access policy](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_access_policy_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") defined using [DEFINE ACCESSPOLICY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_accesspolicy.htm). The name of the self-defined aspect must be the same as the name of the CDS access policy.

The definition of a self-defined aspect contains the following:

-   An aspect entity aspect\_entity, specified after the name aspect, which is used as a data source.
-   An element user\_element of the aspect entity that is used as the input field for the user name of the logged on user.
-   An optional list of elements filter\_element of the aspect entity. With filter elements the rows of the aspect entity can be reduced specifically for a usage location in an access role ( ( ...) = ASPECT ... FILTER BY condition>). Filter elements are addressed in the filter condition using the last component of their path expression, optionally an alias can be specified by the AS addition. Adding filter elements is a compatible change from the perspective of access roles using the aspect, that is, they offer a filtering possibility, but do not mandate that filtering is in fact done.
-   A comma-separated list that specifies the output elements output1, output2, ... of the generic aspect. The specified order applies.
-   Any number of the output fields can be tagged with a condition using the addition BYPASS WHEN aspect\_bypass\_condition. Typical bypass values are \* or an empty value.

The following are possible as bypass conditions aspect\_bypass\_condition:

-   [IS *\[*NOT*\]* NULL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_cond_expr_null_v2.htm)
-   [IS *\[*NOT*\]* INITIAL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_cond_expr_initial_v2.htm)
-   IS INITIAL OR NULL
    
    Is met if the value of the aspect is NULL or the type-compliant initial value.
    
-   \= [literal](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_literal_v2.htm)

At runtime, the field user\_element is filled with the user name of the current user. The rows produced in the aspect entity are matched with their output fields in the specified order and with the elements on the left side of the access condition to which the self-defined aspect is assigned. This means those rows in the protected entity meet the condition for which a row exists for the current user in the aspect entity.

When the bypass condition is used, the match with this field is not used if this condition exists in a row of the aspect entity. A specified value, therefore, (such as an asterisk \*) can be used to indicate that any values of the protected entity are allowed.

Special Requirements in the Aspect Entity

The content of the aspect entity has a particular relevance for audits by being used in a self-defined aspect in access control.

To determine which user had access to particular data at a particular time in a system, it must be possible to reconstruct the state of the data of the aspect entity. Existing mechanisms (such as version management or change documents) cover this requirement in the case of development objects or PFCG roles, whereas aspect entities may freely specify their data sources and cannot control whether these sources are themselves auditable.

The development and runtime systems for CDS access control cannot check whether data sources are auditable. To emphasize this requirement, however, the aspect entity must have the following annotations:

-   An auditing type with the annotation @AccessControl.auditing.type. Currently only the value #CUSTOM is possible.
-   A component with the annotation @AccessControl.auditing.specification specifying (as text) how the content of the entity is audited.

Hints

-   Just adding the annotations, however, does not activate auditing. This annotation should only be set if it is ensured that auditing takes place.
-   Auditing must respect all data sources of the aspect entity.
-   If auditing cannot be ensured, the aspect entity cannot be used in a self-defined aspect.
-   In ABAP SQL access to a CDS entity assigned a role of this type, self-defined aspects are defined internally using a [subquery](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abensubquery_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") after EXISTS.

Currently only the value #CUSTOM is possible.
-   A component with the annotation @AccessControl.auditing.specification specifying (as text) how the content of the entity is audited.

Hints

-   Just adding the annotations, however, does not activate auditing. This annotation should only be set if it is ensured that auditing takes place.
-   Auditing must respect all data sources of the aspect entity.
-   If auditing cannot be ensured, the aspect entity cannot be used in a self-defined aspect.
-   In ABAP SQL access to a CDS entity assigned a role of this type, self-defined aspects are defined internally using a [subquery](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abensubquery_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") after EXISTS.

}

Effect

Defines a [CDS access policy](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_access_policy_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") access\_policy in the [CDS DCL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_dcl_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") to be used as a medium for further definitions.

An ACCESSPOLICY contains the definition of one of the following objects (which must have the same name as the access policy):

-   A [PFCG mapping](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_pfcg_mapping_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [DEFINE PFCG\_MAPPING](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_pfcg_mapping.htm)
-   A self-defined aspect [DEFINE ASPECT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_generic_aspect.htm).

DEFINE ACCESSPOLICY can be used to specify the optional annotation [@access\_policy\_annot](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_dcl_ap_annotations.htm) in front of the actual definition of the access policy.

Hints

-   Separate [DCL source code](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abendcl_source_code_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") must be created for each CDS access policy.

Effect

Specifies an [annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [annotation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_annotations_syntax.htm) as an access policy annotation in the definition of a [CDS access policy](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_access_policy_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in front of the statement [DEFINE ACCESSPOLICY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_accesspolicy.htm). The character @ must be placed directly in front of the name annotation of the annotation.

The table below shows the possible [ABAP annotations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenabap_annotation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that can be specified, and their meanings. No other annotations can be specified.

The first column of the table shows the (possibly structured) name annotation of an ABAP annotation and the second column shows its meaning. The third column shows the possible [annotation values](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenannotation_value_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The fourth column shows the default value which is used if the annotation is not used at all. The fifth column shows the default value set implicitly for value in accordance with the [annotation definition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_anno_definition_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") if the annotation is specified without a value. If nothing is specified for the annotation value, the annotation should be specified without a value.

The EndUserText.label annotation is not recommended for CDS access policies, since its value is overwritten by the identically named annotation of the [PFCG mapping](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_dcl_pm_annotations.htm) or [aspect](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_dcl_as_annotations.htm) in question.

This means that the short text for these objects should be entered here directly and not in the CDS access policy.

[... IN SCENARIO](#!ABAP_ONE_ADD@1@)

Effect

Defines a [PFCG mapping](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_pfcg_mapping_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") pfcg\_mapping as part of a [CDS access policy](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_access_policy_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") defined using [DEFINE ACCESSPOLICY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_accesspolicy.htm). The name of the PFCG mapping must match the name of the CDS access policy.

The definition of a PCFG mapping contains the following:

-   A comma-separated list after the name pfcg\_mapping in which the output fields of the PFCG mapping are defined. These fields must be elements of the CDS entity mapping\_entity specified after BETWEEN. The specified order is relevant.
-   A CDS entity mapping\_entity specified after the keyword BETWEEN to define the fields used in the mapping. This definition specifies the input and output fields of the mapping.
-   An [authorization object](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenauthorization_object_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") auth\_object specified after the keyword AND. The PFCG mapping can be [used](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_cond_pfcg_mapping.htm) in exactly those [PFCG conditions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_cond_pfcg.htm) in which this authorization object is specified after ASPECT pfcg\_auth.
-   A comma-separated unordered list in curly brackets that associates the input fields input1, input2, ... of the mapping with [authorization fields](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenauthorization_field_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") auth\_field of the authorization object auth\_object.
    -   The input fields on the left sides must be elements of the CDS entity mapping\_entity specified after BETWEEN.
    -   Authorization fields of the authorization object auth\_object must be specified on the right sides.
    -   Any number of optional assignments can be flagged using the addition CONSTRAINT ID.

A PFCG mapping can be [used](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_cond_pfcg_mapping.htm) in a [PFCG](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_cond_pfcg.htm) condition of the same authorization object. It is transformed to specific access conditions as follows when the condition is evaluated:

-   The values of the current user for the authorization fields assigned to the input fields fill the input fields of the mapping.
-   The output fields of the mapping are assigned to the elements within the [curly brackets](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_cond_pfcg_mapping.htm) of the PFCG condition in the specified order.
-   The following applies to the input fields flagged with CONSTRAINT ID:
    -   Only those authorization fields of the authorization object can be assigned that contain a single value in a specific authorization. Multiple values or patterns are not allowed (with the exception of full authorization using the value "\*"). Otherwise the PFCG mapping in the PFCG condition returns the value "false" for the authorization in question.
    -   Full authorization can be assigned only when applied to all input fields of the PFCG mapping.
-   If full authorization exists for all input fields of the PFCG mapping (value "\*"), the PFCG mapping in the PFCG condition returns the value "true" when evaluated. This makes it possible to read entries of the protected entity for which there are no output fields in the mapping.

Addition   

... IN SCENARIO

Effect

To use a PFCG mapping in a PFCG condition where the authorization object is subject to the switchable authorization check, the PFCG mapping must also name the same scenario (as well as the same authorization object). For more information, see the [PFCG condition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_cond_pfcg.htm) of the statement DEFINE ROLE.

Hint

In ABAP SQL access to a CDS entity assigned a role of this type, PFCG mappings are defined internally using a subquery after EXISTS.

Example

The following example shows the definition of a PFCG mapping demo\_cds\_auth\_pfcg\_mapping based on the CDS entity demo\_cds\_mapping\_entity below. The output fields of the PFCG mapping are the authorization fields OBJECT, OBJ\_NAME, and DEVCLASS of the authorization object S\_DEVELOP. The input fields of the PFCG mapping are the elements of the CDS entity to which the output fields are assigned. The [example](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_cond_pfcg_mapping.htm) that demonstrates how a PFCG mapping is specified in a role shows how the mapping is used.

Effect

Defines a [PFCG mapping](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_pfcg_mapping_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") pfcg\_mapping as part of a [CDS access policy](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_access_policy_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") defined using [DEFINE ACCESSPOLICY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_accesspolicy.htm). The name of the PFCG mapping must match the name of the CDS access policy.

The definition of a PCFG mapping contains the following:

-   A comma-separated list after the name pfcg\_mapping in which the output fields of the PFCG mapping are defined. These fields must be elements of the CDS entity mapping\_entity specified after BETWEEN. The specified order is relevant.
-   A CDS entity mapping\_entity specified after the keyword BETWEEN to define the fields used in the mapping. This definition specifies the input and output fields of the mapping.
-   An [authorization object](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenauthorization_object_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") auth\_object specified after the keyword AND. The PFCG mapping can be [used](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_cond_pfcg_mapping.htm) in exactly those [PFCG conditions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_cond_pfcg.htm) in which this authorization object is specified after ASPECT pfcg\_auth.
-   A comma-separated unordered list in curly brackets that associates the input fields input1, input2, ... of the mapping with [authorization fields](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abenauthorization_field_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") auth\_field of the authorization object auth\_object.
    -   The input fields on the left sides must be elements of the CDS entity mapping\_entity specified after BETWEEN.
    -   Authorization fields of the authorization object auth\_object must be specified on the right sides.
    -   Any number of optional assignments can be flagged using the addition CONSTRAINT ID.

A PFCG mapping can be [used](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_cond_pfcg_mapping.htm) in a [PFCG](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_cond_pfcg.htm) condition of the same authorization object. It is transformed to specific access conditions as follows when the condition is evaluated:

-   The values of the current user for the authorization fields assigned to the input fields fill the input fields of the mapping.
-   The output fields of the mapping are assigned to the elements within the [curly brackets](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_cond_pfcg_mapping.htm) of the PFCG condition in the specified order.
-   The following applies to the input fields flagged with CONSTRAINT ID:
    -   Only those authorization fields of the authorization object can be assigned that contain a single value in a specific authorization. Multiple values or patterns are not allowed (with the exception of full authorization using the value "\*"). Otherwise the PFCG mapping in the PFCG condition returns the value "false" for the authorization in question.
    -   Full authorization can be assigned only when applied to all input fields of the PFCG mapping.
-   If full authorization exists for all input fields of the PFCG mapping (value "\*"), the PFCG mapping in the PFCG condition returns the value "true" when evaluated. This makes it possible to read entries of the protected entity for which there are no output fields in the mapping.

Addition   

... IN SCENARIO

Effect

To use a PFCG mapping in a PFCG condition where the authorization object is subject to the switchable authorization check, the PFCG mapping must also name the same scenario (as well as the same authorization object). For more information, see the [PFCG condition](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_cond_pfcg.htm) of the statement DEFINE ROLE.

Hint

In ABAP SQL access to a CDS entity assigned a role of this type, PFCG mappings are defined internally using a subquery after EXISTS.

Example

The following example shows the definition of a PFCG mapping demo\_cds\_auth\_pfcg\_mapping based on the CDS entity demo\_cds\_mapping\_entity below. The output fields of the PFCG mapping are the authorization fields OBJECT, OBJ\_NAME, and DEVCLASS of the authorization object S\_DEVELOP. The input fields of the PFCG mapping are the elements of the CDS entity to which the output fields are assigned. The [example](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_cond_pfcg_mapping.htm) that demonstrates how a PFCG mapping is specified in a role shows how the mapping is used.

{
    output1 *\[*BYPASS WHEN aspect\_bypass\_condition*\]*
    *\[*, ... *\]*
}

Effect

Defines a self-defined aspect aspect as part of a [CDS access policy](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_access_policy_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") defined using [DEFINE ACCESSPOLICY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_f1_define_accesspolicy.htm). The name of the self-defined aspect must be the same as the name of the CDS access policy.

The definition of a self-defined aspect contains the following:

-   An aspect entity aspect\_entity, specified after the name aspect, which is used as a data source.
-   An element user\_element of the aspect entity that is used as the input field for the user name of the logged on user.
-   An optional list of elements filter\_element of the aspect entity. With filter elements the rows of the aspect entity can be reduced specifically for a usage location in an access role ( ( ...) = ASPECT ... FILTER BY condition>). Filter elements are addressed in the filter condition using the last component of their path expression, optionally an alias can be specified by the AS addition. Adding filter elements is a compatible change from the perspective of access roles using the aspect, that is, they offer a filtering possibility, but do not mandate that filtering is in fact done.
-   A comma-separated list that specifies the output elements output1, output2, ... of the generic aspect. The specified order applies.
-   Any number of the output fields can be tagged with a condition using the addition BYPASS WHEN aspect\_bypass\_condition. Typical bypass values are \* or an empty value.

The following are possible as bypass conditions aspect\_bypass\_condition:

-   [IS *\[*NOT*\]* NULL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_cond_expr_null_v2.htm)
-   [IS *\[*NOT*\]* INITIAL](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_cond_expr_initial_v2.htm)
-   IS INITIAL OR NULL
    
    Is met if the value of the aspect is NULL or the type-compliant initial value.
    
-   \= [literal](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abencds_literal_v2.htm)

At runtime, the field user\_element is filled with the user name of the current user. The rows produced in the aspect entity are matched with their output fields in the specified order and with the elements on the left side of the access condition to which the self-defined aspect is assigned. This means those rows in the protected entity meet the condition for which a row exists for the current user in the aspect entity.

When the bypass condition is used, the match with this field is not used if this condition exists in a row of the aspect entity. A specified value, therefore, (such as an asterisk \*) can be used to indicate that any values of the protected entity are allowed.

Special Requirements in the Aspect Entity

The content of the aspect entity has a particular relevance for audits by being used in a self-defined aspect in access control.

To determine which user had access to particular data at a particular time in a system, it must be possible to reconstruct the state of the data of the aspect entity. Existing mechanisms (such as version management or change documents) cover this requirement in the case of development objects or PFCG roles, whereas aspect entities may freely specify their data sources and cannot control whether these sources are themselves auditable.

The development and runtime systems for CDS access control cannot check whether data sources are auditable. To emphasize this requirement, however, the aspect entity must have the following annotations:

-   An auditing type with the annotation @AccessControl.auditing.type. Currently only the value #CUSTOM is possible.
-   A component with the annotation @AccessControl.auditing.specification specifying (as text) how the content of the entity is audited.

Hints

-   Just adding the annotations, however, does not activate auditing. This annotation should only be set if it is ensured that auditing takes place.
-   Auditing must respect all data sources of the aspect entity.
-   If auditing cannot be ensured, the aspect entity cannot be used in a self-defined aspect.
-   In ABAP SQL access to a CDS entity assigned a role of this type, self-defined aspects are defined internally using a [subquery](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abensubquery_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") after EXISTS.

Currently only the value #CUSTOM is possible.
-   A component with the annotation @AccessControl.auditing.specification specifying (as text) how the content of the entity is audited.

Hints

-   Just adding the annotations, however, does not activate auditing. This annotation should only be set if it is ensured that auditing takes place.
-   Auditing must respect all data sources of the aspect entity.
-   If auditing cannot be ensured, the aspect entity cannot be used in a self-defined aspect.
-   In ABAP SQL access to a CDS entity assigned a role of this type, self-defined aspects are defined internally using a [subquery](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_756_index_htm/7.56/en-US/abensubquery_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") after EXISTS.
