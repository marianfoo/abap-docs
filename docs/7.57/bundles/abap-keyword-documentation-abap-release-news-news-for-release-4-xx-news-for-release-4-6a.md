-VERERBUNG, 757%0D%0A%0D%0AError:%0D%0A%0D%0A%0D%0A%0D%0ASuggestion for improvement:)

ABAP Objects - Inheritance and Nested Interfaces in Release 4.6A

In Release 4.6A the following components are added to the core ABAP Objects functions:

[1\. Inheritance](#!ABAP_MODIFICATION_1@1@)
[2\. Nested Interfaces](#!ABAP_MODIFICATION_2@2@)

Modification 1   

Inheritance

ABAP Objects enables [inheritance](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_757_index_htm/7.57/en-US/abeninheritance.htm). The addition INHERITING FROM of the statement [CLASS class DEFINITION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_757_index_htm/7.57/en-US/abapclass.htm) can be used to derive a class from a superclass. Each subclass inherits all components from all superclasses and enables specialization by adding its own components and by using the [REDEFINITION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_757_index_htm/7.57/en-US/abapmethods.htm) of previous methods. This makes it possible to define inheritance trees that become more and more specific from subclass to subclass, starting from the root node OBJECT.

The additions ABSTRACT and FINAL of the statements [CLASS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_757_index_htm/7.57/en-US/abapclass.htm) and [METHODS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_757_index_htm/7.57/en-US/abapmethods.htm) make it possible to define abstract and final classes and methods. Abstract classes cannot be instantiated. Abstract methods are not implemented in their class and can occur only in abstract classes. Abstract methods can be implemented in a subclass of the abstract class. Final classes cannot have any subclasses. Final methods cannot be redefined. All methods of final classes are automatically final.

Modification 2   

Nested Interfaces

Interfaces can be [nested](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_757_index_htm/7.57/en-US/abeninterface_composition.htm) by specifying other interfaces as components in the definition of an interface:
[INTERFACE i.](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_757_index_htm/7.57/en-US/abapinterface.htm)
...
[INTERFACES: i1, i2  ...](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_757_index_htm/7.57/en-US/abapinterfaces.htm)
...
[ENDINTERFACE.](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_757_index_htm/7.57/en-US/abapendinterface.htm)

ABAP Objects - Dynamic Method Calls in Release 4.6A

In Release 4.6A, the kernel functions of ABAP Objects are enhanced by dynamic method calls (or dynamic invoke).

Dynamic method call

In addition to the old static [access](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_757_index_htm/7.57/en-US/abenclass_components_addressing.htm), methods can now also be addressed dynamically using the usual ABAP parenthesis semantics.

-   Calling an instance method meth:
    
    CALL METHOD ref->(f)
    

-   Calling a static method meth:
    
    CALL METHOD class=>(f)
    CALL METHOD (c)=>meth
    CALL METHOD (c)=>(f)
    

-   Calling a method within the same class meth:
    
    CALL METHOD (f)
    CALL METHOD ME->(f)
    

f and c are fields containing the name of the method meth or class class.

In contrast to subroutines and function modules, the actual parameters can also be passed dynamically in dynamic [method calls](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_757_index_htm/7.57/en-US/abapcall_method_dynamic.htm).

ABAP Objects - Further Developments in Release 4.6A

In Release 4.6A the following components are added to the core ABAP Objects functions:

[1\. Creating Objects with Explicitly Specified Class](#!ABAP_MODIFICATION_1@1@)
[2\. Non-Public Instantiation](#!ABAP_MODIFICATION_2@2@)
[3\. Internal Tables as Collections](#!ABAP_MODIFICATION_3@3@)
[4\. Functional Methods in Expressions](#!ABAP_MODIFICATION_4@4@)
[5\. C Destructor](#!ABAP_MODIFICATION_5@5@)
[6\. Change Process for Global Interfaces](#!ABAP_MODIFICATION_6@6@)
[7\. Compiler Enhancements](#!ABAP_MODIFICATION_7@7@)
[8\. Internal Optimizations](#!ABAP_MODIFICATION_8@8@)

Modification 1   

Creating Objects with Explicitly Specified Class
The statement [CREATE OBJECT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_757_index_htm/7.57/en-US/abapcreate_object.htm) has two new variants that make it possible to specify the name of the class where the instance is created, both statically and dynamically. Previously, a reference variable with reference to the class had to be created before an object could be created. In the new variants of the statement CREATE OBJECT, any reference variables can be used that are compatible with the specified class.

Modification 2   

Non-Public Instantiation
The new additions CREATE PROTECTED and CREATE PRIVATE of the statement [CLASS class DEFINITION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_757_index_htm/7.57/en-US/abapclass.htm) can be used to ensure that only the class itself or its subclasses can create instances of the class class. This makes instance management non-ambiguous.

Modification 3   

Internal Tables as Collections
If the line type of internal tables contains reference variables as components comp, the attributes attr of the object to which the reference of a line points can be used as key values for reading, sorting, and changing table lines. This is possible in the following statements:

-   LOOP AT itab ... WHERE comp->attr ...
-   READ TABLE itab ... WITH *\[*TABLE*\]* KEY comp->attr = ...
-   SORT itab BY comp->attr ...
-   DELETE itab WHERE comp->attr ...
-   MODIFY itab ... TRANSPORTING ... WHERE comp->attr ...

If a table contains non-structured lines of the type of a reference variable, the attributes of the object to which a line points can be addressed using table\_line\->attr.

Modification 4   

Functional Methods in Expressions
[Functional method](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_757_index_htm/7.57/en-US/abenfunctional_method_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") calls are supported for the following statements and expressions:

-   In arithmetic expressions (COMPUTE)
-   In bit expressions (COMPUTE)
-   In relational expressions
-   In multiple queries (CASE, WHEN)
-   In loops (LOOP)
-   In assignments (\=)

Modification 5   

C Destructor

ABAP Objects does not support an instance destructor that can be implemented in ABAP. For special cases, and for internal use only, there is a destructor known as a [C destructor](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_757_index_htm/7.57/en-US/abenc_destructor.htm).

Modification 6   

Change Process for Global Interfaces

If a method is missing in the implementation, the syntax check produces a warning message instead of an error message. If the method is called at runtime, it is canceled.

If an implemented method is not used, a warning message is produced instead of an error message. The code of the method is ignored.

Modification 7   

Compiler Enhancements

The statement [CLASS class DEFINITION LOAD](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_757_index_htm/7.57/en-US/abapclass_deferred.htm) is no longer required with the following statements:

-   CALL METHOD global\_class=>method
-   SET HANDLER global\_class=>method
-   METHODS m FOR EVENT e OF CLASS global\_class

From within a global superclass, a subclass can be referenced provided that the superclass does not address components of the subclass.

Modification 8   

Internal Optimizations

-   Objects are now addressed indirectly using indexes instead of pointers. This makes the ABAP data layout platform-independent. In addition, this ensures object mobility as a basis for future developments such as:

-   Integrated persistence services
-   Shared memory objects
-   Destroy for objects
-   More compact memory management

-   Improved memory management is achieved because objects are managed without blocks. In addition, objects can be released individually.

-   [Garbage Collector](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_757_index_htm/7.57/en-US/abengarbage_collector_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") uses mark & sweep instead of reference counting, which enables cycles to be detected. This provides efficient support for the debugger in finding all references to a specific object.

-   Finally, a separate interface load has been introduced to relieve the load of the implementing classes from some of its tasks.

Data Objects and Data References in Release 4.6A

In Release 4.6A, references to data objects have been introduced in the following variants:

[1\. Reference Variables for Data Objects](#!ABAP_MODIFICATION_1@1@)
[2\. Creating Data Objects and Getting References](#!ABAP_MODIFICATION_2@2@)
[3\. Assignment of Referenced Fields](#!ABAP_MODIFICATION_3@3@)

Modification 1   

Reference Variables for Data Objects

Previously, reference variables were only available in [ABAP Objects](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_757_index_htm/7.57/en-US/abenabap_objects_oview.htm). In Release 4.6A, [DATA f TYPE REF TO DATA](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_757_index_htm/7.57/en-US/abapdata_simple.htm) can be used to declare f as a reference variable that points to a different data object.

Modification 2   

Creating Data Objects and Getting References

[CREATE DATA dref ...](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_757_index_htm/7.57/en-US/abapcreate_data.htm) can be used to create a new data object (field) at runtime, where dref can be any reference variable with type [REF TO DATA](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_757_index_htm/7.57/en-US/abapdata_simple.htm). Furthermore, [GET REFERENCE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_757_index_htm/7.57/en-US/abapget_reference.htm) can be used to get a reference to a data object (field).

Modification 3   

Assignment of Referenced Fields

The statement [ASSIGN dref->\* TO <fs>](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_757_index_htm/7.57/en-US/abapassign_mem_area_dynamic_dobj.htm) makes the field symbol <fs> point to the same content as the data reference dref at runtime. If the field symbol is typed, the type is checked when the assignment is made.

Description of Data Types and Object Types at Runtime in Release 4.6A

From Release 4.6A, types can be described dynamically.

Previously, the statement [DESCRIBE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_757_index_htm/7.57/en-US/abapdescribe_field.htm) could only describe some of the [ABAP types](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_757_index_htm/7.57/en-US/abentypes_objects_oview.htm). With the introduction of ABAP Objects, an [RTTI concept](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_757_index_htm/7.57/en-US/abenrtti.htm) based on system classes was implemented that enhances the description to include any data types and object types at runtime.

Example for the description of a field

tdescr =  cl\_abap\_typedescr=>describe\_by\_data( f ).

Example for the description of a data reference

tdescr ?= cl\_abap\_typedescr=>describe\_by\_data\_ref( dref ).

Example for the description of an object reference

tdescr ?= cl\_abap\_typedescr=>describe\_by\_object\_ref( oref ).

Examples for descriptions using type names

tdescr = cl\_abap\_typedescr=>describe\_by\_name( name ).

The type description classes contain all of the attributes and methods that can be assigned to the properties of the different types.

Named Includes in Release 4.6A

The statements [INCLUDE STRUCTURE rec.](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_757_index_htm/7.57/en-US/abapinclude_type.htm) and [INCLUDE TYPE type.](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_757_index_htm/7.57/en-US/abapinclude_type.htm) were enhanced so that symbolic accesses to groups of fields in structures are possible.

Variants:

-   The addition AS name causes the components of a type or structure included using INCLUDE to be accessed as a whole under the alias name.

-   The addition RENAMING WITH SUFFIX suff renames the component names by appending the ID suff. The structure type can then be included more than once.

Advantages:

-   [Flat](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_757_index_htm/7.57/en-US/abenflat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") structures and hierarchy views can be defined simultaneously.

-   There are no problems in [alignment](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_757_index_htm/7.57/en-US/abenalignment_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") because the flat structure is aligned automatically so that it can carry the hierarchical structure.

-   Flat and hierarchical views use the same memory, so that no exchange between the different memory areas is necessary.

-   Existing structures can be enhanced compatibly and are integrated in full into ABAP Dictionary.

ror:%0D%0A%0D%0A%0D%0A%0D%0ASuggestion for improvement:)

Casts to Any Data Type in Release 4.6A

The addition CASTING in Release 4.6A allows any memory area to be considered under the aspect of a particular type. This method of typing allows fields to be accessed symbolically instead of specifying offset and length, especially when implementing unions and containers. The following variants are possible:

-   Static cast with implicit type specification
-   Dynamic cast with explicit type specification

[1\. ASSIGN f TO <fs> CASTING](#!ABAP_MODIFICATION_1@1@)
[2\. ASSIGN f TO <fs> CASTING TYPE type](#!ABAP_MODIFICATION_2@2@)
[3\. ASSIGN f TO <fs> CASTING LIKE field](#!ABAP_MODIFICATION_3@3@)

Modification 1   

ASSIGN f TO <fs> CASTING
In this static variant, the field symbol must be completely typed. The content of field f is interpreted in accordance with the type of the field symbol.

Modification 2   

ASSIGN f TO <fs> CASTING TYPE type
Here, the field f is not handled in accordance with the type of the field symbol, but in accordance with the specified type (static variant). If the specified type CASTING TYPE (typename) is placed in parentheses, the content of the data object in the parentheses determines the data type at runtime (dynamic variant).

Modification 3   

ASSIGN f TO <fs> CASTING LIKE field
In this case, field f is handled in accordance with the type of the field field (static variant). This variant is used dynamically by specifying a typed field symbol instead of the field field. Another option is, for example, to pass an untyped parameter in a FORM call. Here, the type of the passed actual parameter would be used at runtime.

Hint

Typed field symbols should be used for performance reasons. The runtime of a typed ASSIGN statement is around 40 percent less than that required for an equivalent untyped ASSIGN statement.

Dynamic Access to Offsets and Lengths in Release 4.6A

Offsets/lengths specified dynamically enable a specific position to be accessed within a field or structure using values that are only known at runtime. This access type is available in Release 4.6A for all statements relating to fields.

Example:

g+off2(len2) = f+off1(len1).

Starting with offset off2 in length len2, the field g is assigned the content of field f starting with offset off1 in length len2. If the two field lengths are not identical, the remaining positions are cut off or padded with initial values. The fields f and g must have the type x, c, n, d, or t. Structures are also allowed.

Internal Tables in Release 4.6A

In Release 4.6A, the following new features have been introduced in internal tables:

[1\. New Keys Specified in Unstructured Internal Tables](#!ABAP_MODIFICATION_1@1@)
[2\. References as Table Keys](#!ABAP_MODIFICATION_2@2@)
[3\. Strings as Table Keys](#!ABAP_MODIFICATION_3@3@)
[4\. Key Definition for Tables in ABAP Dictionary](#!ABAP_MODIFICATION_4@4@)
[5\. Default Key of Unstructured Tables](#!ABAP_MODIFICATION_5@5@)
[6\. Changes to the Internal Structure](#!ABAP_MODIFICATION_6@6@)
[7\. Sorting without Sort Key Specified](#!ABAP_MODIFICATION_7@7@)
[8\. Access to Read-Only Tables](#!ABAP_MODIFICATION_8@8@)
[9\. Index Ranges in Table Extensions](#!ABAP_MODIFICATION_9@9@)
[10\. IS REQUESTED with TABLES Parameter](#!ABAP_MODIFICATION_10@10@)
[11\. Tables as Attributes of Objects](#!ABAP_MODIFICATION_11@11@)
[12\. References as Line Type](#!ABAP_MODIFICATION_12@12@)
[13\. Multiple Identical Keys Specified](#!ABAP_MODIFICATION_13@13@)

Modification 1   

New Keys Specified in Unstructured Internal Tables

If the line type of an internal table does not have a structure, the [pseudo component](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_757_index_htm/7.57/en-US/abenpseudo_component_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") table\_line can be used to specify or address the entire table line as the key. The previous form TABLE LINE is now obsolete. If a [structure](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_757_index_htm/7.57/en-US/abaptypes_struc.htm) contains a component called table\_line, this produces a warning in the syntax check.

Modification 2   

References as Table Keys

References are now allowed as the key of an internal table.

Modification 3   

Strings as Table Keys

[Strings](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_757_index_htm/7.57/en-US/abenstring.htm) are now allowed as the key of an internal table. This applies to all categories of tables.

Modification 4   

Key Definition for Tables in ABAP Dictionary

It is now possible to specify the table key explicitly for internal tables defined in ABAP Dictionary.

Modification 5   

Default Key of Unstructured Tables

The default key of an internal table without a line structure always consists of the whole line. An exception are tables of tables for which an empty key is defined.

Modification 6   

Changes to the Internal Structure

Previously, internal tables were represented at runtime using a structure 256 bytes long. This has now been replaced by a reference that is only 8 bytes long. This means that structures that contain tables as components or tables that include other tables can now be save much more efficiently. This is because tables without content now need only 8 bytes instead of 256 bytes. The benefits are particularly clear in thinly populated structures. Furthermore, the header of a filled table now only requires approximately half of the 256 bytes previously required (the actual figure depends on the platform).

In ABAP Dictionary, all structures containing a field of length 256 bytes intended to include a table header must be modified accordingly.

Modification 7   

Sorting without Sort Key Specified

Sorting an internal table with type >[STANDARD](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_757_index_htm/7.57/en-US/abaptypes_tabcat.htm) or [HASHED](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_757_index_htm/7.57/en-US/abaptypes_tabcat.htm) using the statement [SORT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_757_index_htm/7.57/en-US/abapsort_itab.htm) now returns a correct result, even if the sort key is not specified in the addition BY.

Modification 8   

Access to Read-Only Tables

If the statements [DELETE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_757_index_htm/7.57/en-US/abapdelete_itab.htm), [INSERT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_757_index_htm/7.57/en-US/abapinsert_itab.htm), and [MODIFY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_757_index_htm/7.57/en-US/abapmodify_itab.htm) are applied to read-only tables (for example, IMPORTING-REFERENCE parameters in function modules or READ-ONLY attributes of classes), the system returns a syntax error. This error used to produce a runtime error.

Modification 9   

Index Ranges in Table Extensions

The statements [INSERT LINES OF itab ...](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_757_index_htm/7.57/en-US/abapinsert_itab.htm) and [APPEND LINES OF  itab ...](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_757_index_htm/7.57/en-US/abapappend.htm) return syntax errors if the source table has the type HASHED or ANY and the additions FROM and TO are used to specify an index range. This error used to produce a runtime error.

Modification 10   

IS REQUESTED with TABLES Parameter

If the predicate operator [IS REQUESTED](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_757_index_htm/7.57/en-US/abenlogexp_requested.htm) is used with [TABLES](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_757_index_htm/7.57/en-US/abenfunction.htm) parameters in update modules, the syntax check produces a [warning](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_757_index_htm/7.57/en-US/abenwarning_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). These parameters are always supplied.

Modification 11   

Tables as Attributes of Objects

The statements [LOOP](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_757_index_htm/7.57/en-US/abaploop_at_itab.htm), [READ](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_757_index_htm/7.57/en-US/abapread_table.htm), [SORT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_757_index_htm/7.57/en-US/abapsort_itab.htm), [DELETE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_757_index_htm/7.57/en-US/abapdelete_itab.htm), and [MODIFY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_757_index_htm/7.57/en-US/abapmodify_itab.htm) now support access to the attributes of objects as the keys of internal tables.

If the line type of an internal table contains object reference variables from [ABAP Objects](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_757_index_htm/7.57/en-US/abenabap_objects_oview.htm) as components comp, the attributes attr of the object to which the reference points can be used as key values when reading, sorting, and changing the table. This is possible in the following statements:

LOOP AT itab ... WHERE comp->attr ...

READ TABLE itab ... WITH *\[*TABLE*\]* KEY comp->attr = ...

SORT itab BY comp->attr ...

DELETE itab WHERE comp->attr ...

MODIFY itab ... TRANSPORTING ... WHERE comp->attr ...

Modification 12   

References as Line Type

In the declarative statements [DATA](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_757_index_htm/7.57/en-US/abapdata_itab.htm), [STATICS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_757_index_htm/7.57/en-US/abapstatics.htm), and [TYPES](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_757_index_htm/7.57/en-US/abaptypes_itab.htm), object references and data references can be used as the line type of an internal table.

Modification 13   

Multiple Identical Keys Specified

Identical keys specified more than once in the statement [READ](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_757_index_htm/7.57/en-US/abapread_table.htm) produce a [warning](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_757_index_htm/7.57/en-US/abenwarning_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

%0D%0A%0D%0ASuggestion for improvement:)

Runtime Analysis in Release 4.6A

[1\. Measurement in Parallel Session](#!ABAP_MODIFICATION_1@1@)
[2\. Measurement Restrictions](#!ABAP_MODIFICATION_2@2@)
[3\. Aggregation](#!ABAP_MODIFICATION_3@3@)
[4\. Measurement Variants](#!ABAP_MODIFICATION_4@4@)
[5\. Unique Identification of Internal Tables](#!ABAP_MODIFICATION_5@5@)
[6\. Measurement for Particular Statements](#!ABAP_MODIFICATION_6@6@)
[7\. Hit Lists](#!ABAP_MODIFICATION_7@7@)
[8\. Use of New Tools](#!ABAP_MODIFICATION_8@8@)
[9\. Changes to the User Interface](#!ABAP_MODIFICATION_9@9@)

Modification 1   

Measurement in Parallel Session
Runtime analysis can be activated for ten simultaneous [ABAP sessions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_757_index_htm/7.57/en-US/abenabap_session_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") (work processes). This makes it possible to switch to a long-running job from outside. It is possible to switch in and out of the work processes that are measured using a screen similar to transaction SM50.

Modification 2   

Measurement Restrictions
It is possible to restrict the duration of a measurement, the size of the performance data file, and also the objects that are measured.

-   The duration of the measurement is specified in minutes.
    
    The measurement ends after this time.
    The maximum duration is approximately 72 minutes.
    

-   The size of the performance data file is specified in kilobytes. Once this size is reached, the measurement ends.

-   It is possible to restrict the measurement to specific objects:
    
    Programs and function pools
    Global and local classes
    Methods, subroutines, or function modules.
    Particular statements
    

Modification 3   

Aggregation

Aggregations can be full aggregations and aggregations by call point. In full aggregation, all performance data for a particular type of event is summarized in a single performance record. In aggregations by call point, all performance data from a particular event onwards is summarized.

This makes it possible to use aggregation as the first step in a runtime analysis to identify the most time-consuming calls. The second, more detailed analysis can then be restricted to these objects.

Certain information does not exist when aggregations are used: There is no hierarchy. Furthermore, it is not possible to branch to the call point from a full aggregation. The effect of the display filter is that the events are displayed without their net times being recalculated.

Modification 4   

Measurement Variants

The default variant is stored under the name DEFAULT. If this variant is changed, the changed data is assigned temporarily under the name USER\_DEFAULT. If the same restrictions are used frequently, it is best to create a variant. A variant exists only in the system in which it is created, and it can be used, changed, or deleted by any user.

Modification 5   

Unique Identification of Internal Tables

The name of an internal table is the internally unique ID. This makes it possible to distinguish between identically named internal tables from different [procedures](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_757_index_htm/7.57/en-US/abenprocedure_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The actual name of the internal table can be identified by navigating to the editor.

Modification 6   

Measurement for Particular Statements

The total runtime of all loop passes is determined in LOOP AT itab. CREATE OBJECT is only measured if the method CONSTRUCTOR is overwritten.

Modification 7   

Hit Lists

In the hit list of the database tables, the buffering is empty if buffering is switched off or not allowed. As well as the database hit list, there are object-based hit lists for classes, instances, and internal tables. For classes and instances, there is a further division between methods and events.

Modification 8   

Use of New Tools

The various hit lists are created using ABAP List Viewer. All regular ALV functions are available within the hit list, although full navigation from the list is not possible.

ABAP List Viewer is also used to display the performance statistics. They are calculated using method calls, and the load time and net runtime of the program are added to them.

Modification 9   

Changes to the User Interface

The user interface of the runtime analysis tool has been fully revised. The new features are represented by four main areas, which can be branched to from the initial screen, namely:

-   Executing the runtime analysis
-   Switching on an ABAP session
-   Setting the measurement restrictions
-   Analyzing the measurement results

0A%0D%0ASuggestion for improvement:)

Debugger in Release 4.6A

In Release 4.6A, the following functions were added to ABAP Debugger:

[1\. Editing Strings](#!ABAP_MODIFICATION_1@1@)
[2\. Enhancements in ABAP Objects](#!ABAP_MODIFICATION_2@2@)
[3\. Other](#!ABAP_MODIFICATION_3@3@)

Modification 1   

Editing Strings

The display of the data types string and xstring can now be scrolled. The cursor can be positioned on the string by double-clicking it. It is also possible to declare strings as watchpoints.

Modification 2   

Enhancements in ABAP Objects

[Static attributes](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_757_index_htm/7.57/en-US/abenstatic_attribute_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and handlers of [static events](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_757_index_htm/7.57/en-US/abenstatic_event_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") can now be displayed without specifying an instance. It is also possible to find all references to a specific object. The same applies to data references.

Modification 3   

Other

The 'System Debugging' setting is saved too when breakpoints are saved. Furthermore, the new 'Last [Short Dump](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_757_index_htm/7.57/en-US/abenshort_dump_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")' button makes it possible to display the last runtime error created. This can also be done using the transaction LAST\_SHORTDUMP.

Modification 1   

New Event Keyword LOAD-OF-PROGRAM

[LOAD-OF-PROGRAMM](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_757_index_htm/7.57/en-US/abapload-of-program.htm) is an event keyword which processes an event immediately before execution of the first load statement. For example, when a function module is called, the statements following LOAD-OF-PROGRAM are executed first after the function pool has been loaded into the program memory. It is then no longer necessary to know the order of execution.

This statement has the same effect as a program constructor, similar to the class constructor in ABAP Objects, which replaces the event LOAD-OF-PROGRAM in [class pools](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_757_index_htm/7.57/en-US/abenclass_pool_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and global classes.

Modification 2   

Typing of Ranges Tables

The addition RANGE of the statements [DATA](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_757_index_htm/7.57/en-US/abapdata.htm), [STATICS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_757_index_htm/7.57/en-US/abapstatics.htm), and [TYPES](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_757_index_htm/7.57/en-US/abaptypes.htm) defines an internal table with the type [RANGES](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_757_index_htm/7.57/en-US/abapranges.htm). This addition can also be used for the definitions in classes and is supported in ABAP Dictionary.

Modification 3   

Increased Precision in BCD Arithmetic

In rare cases in fixed point arithmetic, calculations were performed with a precision of 15 instead of 31 places. This meant that fields with many [decimal places](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_757_index_htm/7.57/en-US/abendecimal_place_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") were sometimes rounded off. Now calculations are always performed to an accuracy of 31 places.

This change has resulted in a significant reduction of the computing time required for multiplication and division.

Modification 4   

F1 Help for Dynamic Field Access

Previously, F1 help in [dynpros](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_757_index_htm/7.57/en-US/abendynpro_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and lists was not available for fields addressed using [field symbols](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_757_index_htm/7.57/en-US/abapfield-symbols.htm) or [ASSIGN COMPONENT ...](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_757_index_htm/7.57/en-US/abapassign_dynamic_components.htm), although the assigned field was defined in ABAP Dictionary. Online help is now available for all fields that have a HELP ID.

Modification 5   

More Local and Global Data Descriptions

Previously, a 16 KB address space was available for global and local static descriptions. Now 16 KB each are reserved separately for the local definitions of subroutines, functions, and methods to reduce the workload in the address space for global descriptions.

Modification 6   

More Literals and Memory for Literals

The address space for [literals](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_757_index_htm/7.57/en-US/abenliteral.htm) has also been expanded so that 64 KB are now available for the different literals. The length of the individual literals is limited only by operating system restrictions. Previously, a maximum of 64 KB was available for all literals together (indexes and texts).

Modification 7   

Improvements in Documentation

The documentation has been improved as follows:

-   Standardized presentation in the keyword documentation and the application help BC - ABAP Programming

-   Extensive documentation of dynpros and the structure SYST in the application help

-   ABAP statement reference in the application help

-   Detailed visualization of overviews by using figures in the application help

-   Links from the keyword documentation to the corresponding sections of the application help for each ABAP statement

-   All example programs for display, execution, and debugging available in transaction ABAPDOCU.

Further Changes in Release 4.6A

[1\. LOOP in Extracts](#!ABAP_MODIFICATION_1@1@)
[2\. Time Zone Handling in RFC Calls](#!ABAP_MODIFICATION_2@2@)
[3\. Bit Operations with Differing Operand Lengths](#!ABAP_MODIFICATION_3@3@)
[4\. Multiple-Field ASSIGN on Method Parameters](#!ABAP_MODIFICATION_4@4@)
[5\. Obsolete Read Access to Database Tables](#!ABAP_MODIFICATION_5@5@)
[6\. Error Handling for File Statements](#!ABAP_MODIFICATION_6@6@)

Modification 1   

LOOP in Extracts

As with internal tables, SY-SUBRC is now set to 4 in an extract if, in a [LOOP ... ENDLOOP](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_757_index_htm/7.57/en-US/abaploop-.htm), the loop pass is not executed.

Modification 2   

Time Zone Handling in RFC Calls

RFC calls in AS ABAP where the default time zone differs from the personal time zone of the user are now executed using the caller's personal time zone.

Modification 3   

Bit Operations with Differing Operand Lengths

If operands with differing lengths are joined using statements such as [COMPUTE x = bitexp.](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_757_index_htm/7.57/en-US/abapcompute_bit.htm), all operands are standardized to the length of the longest operand involved. The shorter operands are padded with trailing HEX 0 characters. Until now, the length of the target field was respected, but now only the operands of the right side are considered in the calculation.

Modification 4   

Multiple-Field ASSIGN on Method Parameters

[ASSIGN f TO <fs>](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_757_index_htm/7.57/en-US/abapassign.htm) statements on method parameters passed by reference that exceed the length of the parameter are now forbidden. This used to be allowed as long as the statement did not exceed the segment length.

Modification 5   

Obsolete Read Access to Database Tables

When database tables are accessed using the statements [READ TABLE dbtab](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_757_index_htm/7.57/en-US/abapread_table_dbtab.htm) and [LOOP AT dbtab](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_757_index_htm/7.57/en-US/abaploop_at_dbtab.htm), a runtime error occurs if the key of the database table contains components that do not have a character-like type. Both statements are obsolete anyway, and can be replaced using appropriate [SELECT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_757_index_htm/7.57/en-US/abapselect.htm) statements.

Modification 6   

Error Handling for File Statements

All file statements now include error handling, which means that any errors detected raise a catchable exception. Previously, only some statements set a return code in the field SY-SUBRC.
