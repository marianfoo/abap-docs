ABAP release

Release of the [AS ABAP](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_757_index_htm/7.57/en-US/abenas_abap_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and its programming languages and infrastructure. The counting of the releases is done by release numbers such as 7.55, 7.56, 7.57, ... These release numbers are based on the technical release names of the associated software component SAP\_BASIS. The releases of the [ABAP Platforms](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_757_index_htm/7.57/en-US/abenabap_platform_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), for which an ABAP release is used, have other release numbers and can be mapped to the ABAP releases. The releases of the underlying [ABAP kernel](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_757_index_htm/7.57/en-US/abenkernel_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") are also counted differently and can also be mapped to the ABAP releases.
