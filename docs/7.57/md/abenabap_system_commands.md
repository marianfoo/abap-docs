ABAP and Operating System Statements

Operating system statements or system commands execute statements or programs directly on the operating system of the host computer of an AS instance or of a presentation server. Executing operating system statements from ABAP programs should be the exception rather than the rule, however it may become necessary in system or administration programs to call operating system functions that cannot be accessed by ABAP statements. In certain circumstances, input from external sources may need to be passed to the operating system.

Security Hint

Using input from external sources in operating system statements poses the risk of [system command injections](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_757_index_htm/7.57/en-US/abensys_comm_injections_scrty.htm).
