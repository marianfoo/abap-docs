business object

BO for short. A BO represents the data and behavior of an object in the real world, similar to an object in object-oriented programming. A BO supports the specific requirements of business programming. Typical BOs represent a sales order, a flight booking, or a product. A BO wraps access to the associated data, whose persistence is transparent for the user of the BO. The data of a BO can be stored in one or more database tables or also in other repositories. The behavior of a BO for reading and changing access to its data is based on best practices that have proved to be suitable for such accesses. Access to business data using a BO makes it easier for application programmers to apply such best practices. On an [AS ABAP](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_757_index_htm/7.57/en-US/abenas_abap_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), BOs are supported by different frameworks, where [RAP BOs](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_757_index_htm/7.57/en-US/abenrap_bo_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") are best integrated into ABAP.
