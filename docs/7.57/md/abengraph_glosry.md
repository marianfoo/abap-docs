graph

An abstraction that can model different kinds of networks and linked data. A graph can be considered as a network that has nodes (i. e. [vertices](javascript:call_link\('abenvertex_glosry.htm'\) "Glossary Entry")) and links (i. e. [edges](javascript:call_link\('abenedge_glosry.htm'\) "Glossary Entry")) that are connected. In [SAP HANA](javascript:call_link\('abensap_hana_glosry.htm'\) "Glossary Entry"), a graph is a set of vertices and a set of edges. Each edge connects two vertices. One vertex is denoted as the source and the other as the target. Edges are always directed. Any number of edges may connect the same two vertices. Vertices and edges can have any number of attributes. An attribute consists of a name that is associated with a data type and a value.
