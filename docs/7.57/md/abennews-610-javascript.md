Integrating JavaScript in Release 6.10

In Release 6.10, Java scripts can be called from an ABAP program, which allows debugging in the source code of Java scripts. Integration also makes it possible to access ABAP Objects and ABAP data objects from JavaScript. Instance methods of ABAP Objects can also be called from JavaScript.

Hint

Support for the connection of JavaScript to ABAP will be discontinued without replacement in a release after 7.02.
