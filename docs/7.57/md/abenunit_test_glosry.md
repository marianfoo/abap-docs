unit test

A unit test is created and executed by developers to verify the functional correctness of individual software units. A software unit is defined in this case, as a non-trivial code unit in which certain input has a verifiable effect. [Procedures](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_757_index_htm/7.57/en-US/abenprocedure_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") are a typical example for these units in ABAP. Procedures are the smallest functional components of larger units such as [classes](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_757_index_htm/7.57/en-US/abenclass_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or [function pools](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_757_index_htm/7.57/en-US/abenfunction_pool_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). Unit tests determine during the development and quality assurance stages that the individual components of a larger software unit work correctly. Unit tests are developed and executed in [ABAP Unit](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_757_index_htm/7.57/en-US/abenabap_unit_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
