C2 Contract Rules

In [ABAP Cloud](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_758_index_htm/7.58/en-US/abenabap_cloud_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), the language version [ABAP for Cloud Development](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_758_index_htm/7.58/en-US/abenabap_for_cloud_dev_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") must be used, where access to [repository objects](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_758_index_htm/7.58/en-US/abenrepository_object_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is restricted to [released APIs](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_758_index_htm/7.58/en-US/abenreleased_api_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

The [C2 contract](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_758_index_htm/7.58/en-US/abenc2_contract_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") is the [release contract](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_758_index_htm/7.58/en-US/abenrelease_contract_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that is crucial for remote access to APIs from external consumers. The following topics list the most important rules that must be obeyed by API providers and API consumers.
