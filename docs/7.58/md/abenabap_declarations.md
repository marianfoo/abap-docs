Declaration Statements

This section describes the declaration of object types, data types, data objects and field symbols.

-   [Classes and Interfaces](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_758_index_htm/7.58/en-US/abenclasses_and_interfaces.htm)
-   [Data Types](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_758_index_htm/7.58/en-US/abentypes_statements.htm)
-   [Data Objects](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_758_index_htm/7.58/en-US/abenobjects_statements.htm)
-   [Field Symbols](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_758_index_htm/7.58/en-US/abenabap_field_symbols.htm)
-   [Special Declarations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_758_index_htm/7.58/en-US/abendeclarations_spcl.htm)

Hints

-   The statements [PARAMETERS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_758_index_htm/7.58/en-US/abapparameters.htm) and [SELECT OPTIONS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_758_index_htm/7.58/en-US/abapselect-options.htm) for the declaration of input fields on [selection screens](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_758_index_htm/7.58/en-US/abenselection_screen_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") are also declarative statements but are listed separately in the corresponding sections.
-   In addition to the explicit options for declaring data objects listed here, there are also statements and additions that implicitly declare data objects, such as [SELECTION-SCREEN COMMENT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_758_index_htm/7.58/en-US/abapselection-screen_comment.htm). However, most of these statements are obsolete, for example [SUMMING](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_758_index_htm/7.58/en-US/abapsumming.htm).
