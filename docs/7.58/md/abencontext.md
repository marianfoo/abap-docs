Contexts (Obsolete)

Contexts are [repository objects](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_758_index_htm/7.58/en-US/abenrepository_object_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") defined abstractly in the [Context Builder](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_758_index_htm/7.58/en-US/abencontext_builder_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") (transaction SE33) in the [ABAP Workbench](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_758_index_htm/7.58/en-US/abenabap_workbench_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that are used to derive the values of additional fields from key fields. ABAP programs work with instances of contexts.

A context consists of fields and modules. The fields of a context are subdivided into key fields and derived fields. The modules describe how the values of the derived fields are created from the key fields. Modules are based on

-   [foreign key dependencies](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_758_index_htm/7.58/en-US/abenforeign_key_dependency_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") between database tables defined in the ABAP Dictionary and
-   function modules,
-   or in other contexts.
-   Viewed from a technical perspective, contexts are special ABAP programs (context programs CONTEXT\_X\_...) generated by the Context Builder.

An ABAP program can create one or more instances of a context. It can supply the key fields for each instance with values and query the fields derived. Each context has a cross-transaction [buffer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_758_index_htm/7.58/en-US/abencontext_buffer.htm) on the [AS instance](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_758_index_htm/7.58/en-US/abenas_instance_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), whose properties are defined in the Context Builder. When an instance is queried for values, the system first searches the corresponding buffer for a data record with the corresponding key fields. Only if no values exist yet for this key are they derived from the modules and written to the buffer.

The statements [CONTEXTS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_758_index_htm/7.58/en-US/abapcontexts.htm), [SUPPLY](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_758_index_htm/7.58/en-US/abapsupply.htm), and [DEMAND](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_758_index_htm/7.58/en-US/abapdemand.htm) are used to handle contexts.

Hint

Although contexts can be compared with highly specialized classes, they are not part of [ABAP Objects](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_758_index_htm/7.58/en-US/abenabap_objects_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). Contexts were introduced for high-performance access to frequently required derived data. Since the introduction of ABAP Objects, further development of contexts has been discontinued. Contexts can now be replaced by [shared objects](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_758_index_htm/7.58/en-US/abenshared_objects_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
