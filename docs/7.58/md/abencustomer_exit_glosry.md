customer exit

Option provided by SAP for the enhancement of delivered standard programs without modification of the original program in a customer system. For potential customer requirements that are not part of the standard, SAP provides blank containers, which customers can fill with their own functions. Customer exits are managed by SAP in [transaction](javascript:call_link\('abentransaction_glosry.htm'\) "Glossary Entry") SMOD. In transaction CMOD, the customers select the enhancement that they want to process, groups them together as enhancement projects, processes the components, and activates the relevant projects. Customer exits are obsolete and have been replaced by [BAdIs](javascript:call_link\('abenbadi_glosry.htm'\) "Glossary Entry") and other [enhancement points](javascript:call_link\('abenenhancement_point_glosry.htm'\) "Glossary Entry").
