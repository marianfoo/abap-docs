GraphScript

GraphScript is an imperative programming language that provides a high-level interface for accessing the [graph](javascript:call_link\('abengraph_glosry.htm'\) "Glossary Entry") data defined by a [graph workspace](javascript:call_link\('abengraph_workspace_glosry.htm'\) "Glossary Entry"). It helps develop graph algorithms and integrates them into SQL-based data processing. It also provides optimized built-in algorithms to solve common graph-related problems, such as finding the shortest path from one [vertex](javascript:call_link\('abenvertex_glosry.htm'\) "Glossary Entry") to another. These algorithms are available as built-in functions that can be reused in any GraphScript program to simplify the development of efficient solutions for customer-specific, graph-related problems. In case of inconsistent graph workspaces, GraphScript procedures exit with an error.
