News for ABAP Release 7.0 and its EhPs

From [ABAP release](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_758_index_htm/7.58/en-US/abenabap_release_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") 7.0, the further development of ABAP and the ABAP runtime framework took place in Enhancement Packs (EhPs). There were no changes between ABAP release 7.0 and EhP1 (ABAP release 7.01), but in EhP2 (ABAP release 7.02) massive enhancements were made, resulting from a porting of a parallel release track (7.1, 7.2). In EhP3 (ABAP release 7.03) (identical to ABAP release 7.3, EhP1 (7.31) with respect to ABAP and the ABAP runtime framework), hardly any changes were made.
