Modification

Support for the New 12 Hour Format

The new addition [ENVIRONMENT TIME FORMAT](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_758_index_htm/7.58/en-US/abapwrite_to_options.htm) to the WRITE TO and WRITE statements supports the new [12 hour format](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_758_index_htm/7.58/en-US/abennews-710-others.htm).

The [predefined time formats](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_758_index_htm/7.58/en-US/abenwrite_formats.htm) of the statements WRITE TO and WRITE cannot be affected automatically due to downward compatibility.
