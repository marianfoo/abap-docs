package

A package encapsulates [repository objects](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_758_index_htm/7.58/en-US/abenrepository_object_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") in self-contained units. Packages are themselves repository objects and connect the repository objects they contain to the [Change and Transport System (CTS)](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_758_index_htm/7.58/en-US/abencts_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The components of a package that can be used outside of the package must be published in a package interface. A package that accesses the repository objects of another package must declare this and have permission from the other package. Packages are created using [Package Builder](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_758_index_htm/7.58/en-US/abenpackage_builder_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). See also [Package Concept](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_758_index_htm/7.58/en-US/abenpackage_concept_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
