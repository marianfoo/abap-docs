Contract Rules for ABAP Released APIs

In [ABAP Cloud](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_758_index_htm/7.58/en-US/abenabap_cloud_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") changes and extensions to released APIs are strictly governed by [release contracts](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_758_index_htm/7.58/en-US/abenrelease_contract_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). These release contracts describe which compatible changes and extensions are allowed for a released API from release to release. ABAP developments that access such APIs must be aware of the possibility of such compatible changes and design the access accordingly. The following topics describe the allowed compatible changes or extensions and contain rules for accessing such released APIs.

-   [C0 Contract Rules](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_758_index_htm/7.58/en-US/abenc0_contract_rules.htm)
-   [C1 Contract Rules](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_758_index_htm/7.58/en-US/abenc1_contract_rules.htm)
-   [C2 Contract Rules](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_758_index_htm/7.58/en-US/abenc2_contract_rules.htm)
