CPI-C Interface

This section describes cross-system communications between two ABAP programs which is implemented using the [COMMUNICATION](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/abapcommunication.htm) statement.

Hint

SDK for CPI-C is no longer supported. The CPI-C libraries and the documentation for programming are no longer delivered. For new programs, SDK and the libraries for [RFC](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/abenrfc_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") must be used. The API for CPI-C will remain for the time being to support existing programs and for internal technical purposes.
