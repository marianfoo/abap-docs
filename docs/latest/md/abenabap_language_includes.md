Source Code Modules

Source code modularization is the decomposition of the source code of a program into individual units. It is independent of the decomposition of an ABAP program into processing blocks.

Source code modules are implemented either as [include programs](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/abenabap_language_include.htm) or as [macros](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/abenabap_macros.htm). Include programs are used to structure large programs, whereas macros can be used to reuse individual parts of programs.
