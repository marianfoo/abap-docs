ABAP Objects - Statements in ABAP Objects

The statements in ABAP Objects can be differentiated as follows:

-   [Statements for defining classes and interfaces](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/abendefining_classes_interfaces.htm)
    
    These statements define classes and interfaces and their components. They can be used for local and global classes or interfaces.
    
-   [Statements for implementing methods](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/abendefining_methods.htm)
    
    These statements implement the functions of classes in methods.
    
-   [Statements in class pools and interface pools](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/abenclass_interace_pools.htm)
    
    In addition to the statements for defining the global class, statements for local declarations and implementations can also be used in [class pools](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/abenclass_pool_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). In [interface pools](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/abeninterface_pool_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), only the global interface can be declared. The obsolete statement [TYPE-POOLS](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/abaptype-pools.htm) is also syntactically possible.
    

A language cleanup was performed in ABAP Objects. The [stricter ABAP syntax](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/abenabap_objects_strict.htm) now applies to all statements in ABAP Objects.
