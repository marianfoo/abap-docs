Selection Screen Events and List Events

Selection screen events and list events are events of classic [dynpro](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/abendynpro_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") processing that are transformed into ABAP events by the ABAP runtime framework and are handled directly in the ABAP program instead of in the [dynpro flow logic](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/abendynpro_flow_logic_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

-   [Selection screen events](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/abenselection_screen_events.htm) occur during [selection screen processing](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/abenexecutable_program_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
-   [List events](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/abenabap_lists_interactive.htm) occur during classic [list processing](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/abenlist_processing_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

They are described in their respective environments.
