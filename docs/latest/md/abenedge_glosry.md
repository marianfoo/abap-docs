edge

Stores [graph](javascript:call_link\('abengraph_glosry.htm'\) "Glossary Entry") data in combination with [vertices](javascript:call_link\('abenvertex_glosry.htm'\) "Glossary Entry"). An edge can be considered as a link that links two nodes (i. e. vertices) in a network. One vertex is denoted as the source and the other as the target. An edge connects two vertices. Edges are always directed. Any number of edges may connect the same two vertices. Edges can have any number of attributes. An attribute consists of a name that is associated with a data type and a value.
