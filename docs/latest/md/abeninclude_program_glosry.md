include program

[ABAP program](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/abenabap_program_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that cannot be compiled independently but must be included in another ABAP program using the statement [INCLUDE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/abapinclude_prog.htm). To be able to be compiled, an include program must be part of a [compilation unit](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/abencompilation_unit_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). An include program should only be assigned to a single compilation unit.
