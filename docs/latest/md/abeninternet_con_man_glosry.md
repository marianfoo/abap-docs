Internet Communication Manager

ICM for short. A process of [AS ABAP](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/abenas_abap_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") that enables AS ABAP to communicate directly with the Internet using HTTP/HTTPS/SMTP. The ICM is used to connect an AS ABAP to web-based presentation components such as [SAPUI5](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/abensapui5_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), [Web Dynpro ABAP](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/abenweb_dynpro_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), and [BSP](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/abenbsp_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). The ICM also enables an AS ABAP to serve both as a client and as a server for Web services. ABAP programs access ICM via classes and interfaces of the [Internet Communication Framework](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/abeninternet_con_fra_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
