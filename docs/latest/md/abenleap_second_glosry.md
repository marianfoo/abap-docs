leap second

Second by which a month is extended at the end of quarter in [UTC](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/abenutc_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") reference time to compensate the effect of the slower rotation of the earth with respect to the TAI (Temps Atomique International). A leap second day has 86401 seconds and the leap second is represented by 23:59:60. The standard [POSIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX) 1:2001 does not support leap seconds and each day has 86400 seconds. In times based on the POSIX standard, any leap seconds are rounded to valid times.
