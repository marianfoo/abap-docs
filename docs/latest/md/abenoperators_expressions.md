Operators and Expressions

An operator usually combines two operands as an [expression](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/abenexpressions.htm) or is used together with an operand to construct an expression. When a statement containing such an expression is executed, the result of the expression is determined (operation) and is used in the statement. Operators are represented either by special characters or [reserved names](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/abenabap_words.htm).
