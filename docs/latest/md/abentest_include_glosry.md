test include

Special include program in which the [test classes](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/abentest_class_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of an [ABAP program](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/abenabap_program_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") are listed. Except for test includes for [class pools](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/abenclass_pool_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and [function pools](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/abenfunction_pool_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") no test includes can currently be created. The associated [ABAP Workbench](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/abenabap_workbench_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") tools or [ABAP development tools for Eclipse (ADT)](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/abenadt_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") access the associated test include automatically. The name of the test include of a class pool ends with CCAU and the name of a function pool ends with T99. For other programs, the naming convention of the test include is the name of the program that is padded with \= up to and including the 34th position and ending in T.
