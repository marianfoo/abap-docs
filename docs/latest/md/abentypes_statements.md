Data Types

Data types are templates for creating data objects. Data types can be defined independently in an ABAP program or in the ABAP Dictionary. Data types can also be non-independent as properties of data objects. Data types do not use any memory space for work data but may require memory for administrative information.

In ABAP programs, data types local to the program can be defined, which can be used for [typing](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/abentyping_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or declaring further data types or data objects, depending on their validity and visibility.

Data types defined in the [public](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/abenpublic_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") [visibility section](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/abenvisibility_section_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") of a [global class](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/abenglobal_class_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or [global interface](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/abenglobal_interface_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") are visible to other programs.

The associated statements are:

-   [TYPES](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/abaptypes.htm)
-   [INCLUDE TYPE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/abapinclude_type.htm)
